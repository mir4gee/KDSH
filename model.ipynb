       "'Optimizing System Design Principles on Inverted\\nHarmonica Tuning Frequencies\\nAbstract\\nThe intricacies of system design intersect with the existential implications of\\nquantum cheese, which in turn, influences the aerodynamic properties of flamingos,\\nand conversely, the abstract notion of colorless green ideas sleeping furiously, while\\nthe ontological status of furniture arrangements in Scandinavian apartments remains\\nan enigma, alongside the theoretical frameworks governing the migration patterns\\nof narwhals and the surreptitious culinary habits of extraterrestrial beings, all of\\nwhich converge to form a holistic understanding of the synergistic relationships\\nbetween disparate entities, transcending the boundaries of reality and fantasy, in a\\nrealm where the cartography of lost socks and the topological analysis of coffee\\ncreamer dispensers serve as metaphors for the human condition, and ultimately, the\\nsearch for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, through the deconstruction\\nof postmodernist narratives and the reconceptualization of temporal flows in relation\\nto the viscosity of ketchup and the sonorous qualities of whispers in a vacuum.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe aforementioned paradigm shift necessitates a reevaluation of the role of system design in\\nfacilitating the emergence of complex systems, which in turn, gives rise to a plethora of unforeseen\\nconsequences, including the spontaneous generation of miniature black holes in toaster ovens, the\\nprecipitous decline of disco music as a viable form of artistic expression, and the concomitant rise\\nof cryptid sightings in suburban areas, all of which underscore the imperative of adopting a more\\nnuanced and interdisciplinary approach to system design, one that accommodates the labyrinthine\\nintricacies of human perception, the vicissitudes of celestial mechanics, and the ephemeral nature\\nof digital ephemera, in a quest to distill the essence of reality from the cacophony of competing\\nnarratives and the ambiguities of existential dread, thereby illuminating the path towards a more\\nenlightened and harmonious coexistence with the universe, or at the very least, a more efficient\\nmethod for organizing kitchen utensils.\\nThe dialectical tension between the Apollonian and Dionysian aspects of system design serves as a\\ncatalyst for the emergence of novel solutions, which in turn, are influenced by the hermeneutics of\\npastry decoration, the semiotics of traffic patterns, and the mystical properties of forgotten umbrellas,\\nall of which converge to form a rich tapestry of meaning, replete with hidden patterns and unforeseen\\nconsequences, waiting to be deciphered by intrepid researchers and visionary thinkers, who are\\nwilling to challenge the status quo, push the boundaries of conventional wisdom, and venture into\\nthe uncharted territories of the unknown, in pursuit of a deeper understanding of the intricate web of\\nrelationships that underlies the complex systems that govern our world, and perhaps, just perhaps,\\nuncover the hidden secrets of the universe, or at the very least, develop a more efficient algorithm for\\nfolding fitted sheets.\\nThe synthesis of these disparate threads of inquiry and exploration gives rise to a novel paradigm for\\nsystem design, one that is grounded in the principles of ontological humility, epistemological curiosity,\\nand methodological pluralism, and which seeks to reconcile the competing demands of functionality,\\naesthetics, and sustainability, in a quest to create systems that are not only efficient and effective\\nbut also beautiful, just, and sustainable, and which ultimately, contribute to the betterment of thehuman condition, or at the very least, provide a more satisfactory explanation for the disappearance\\nof missing socks, and the concomitant rise of mysterious stains on otherwise pristine carpets, in a\\nworld where the surreal and the mundane coexist in a delicate balance of wonder and bewilderment.\\nThe efficacy of system design is intricately linked to the migratory patterns of sparrows, which in\\nturn have a profound impact on the development of fractal theory, a concept that has been largely\\noverlooked in the realm of culinary arts, particularly in the preparation of soufflés, which require a\\ndeep understanding of thermodynamics and the behavior of gases under varying conditions of pressure\\nand temperature, much like the intricate dance of subatomic particles in a high-energy collision,\\nwhere the principles of quantum mechanics are juxtaposed with the art of playing the harmonica, an\\ninstrument that has been known to induce a state of trance in certain species of dolphins, who are\\nthemselves capable of communicating through complex patterns of clicks and whistles, a language\\nthat has been studied extensively in the field of exolinguistics, a discipline that seeks to understand the\\npotential for language development on distant planets, where the atmosphere is composed of a unique\\nblend of gases, including helium and neon, which are also used in the production of fluorescent\\nlighting, a technology that has revolutionized the field of interior design, particularly in the creation of\\nambiance for minimalist furniture, which is often crafted from sustainable materials, such as bamboo\\nand recycled plastic, both of which have a significant impact on the global ecosystem, particularly\\nin the context of climate change, a phenomenon that is closely tied to the orbit of the planet Jupiter,\\nwhose massive size and gravitational pull have a profound effect on the Earth’s tides, which in turn\\nhave a significant impact on the development of coastal erosion, a process that is influenced by the\\npresence of certain types of seaweed, which are themselves a rich source of nutritional supplements,\\nincluding vitamins and minerals, that are essential for maintaining a healthy diet, particularly in the\\ncontext of space exploration, where the lack of gravity can have a profound impact on the human\\nbody, particularly in terms of muscle mass and bone density, which are both critical factors in the\\ndevelopment of effective exercise routines, a topic that has been extensively studied in the field of\\nkinesiology, a discipline that seeks to understand the intricacies of human movement, including the\\ncomplex patterns of locomotion and balance, which are both essential for navigating the complexities\\nof urban planning, particularly in the context of designing efficient public transportation systems,\\nwhere the flow of traffic is influenced by a complex array of factors, including road geometry, traffic\\nsignals, and pedestrian behavior, all of which must be carefully considered in order to create a\\nsystem that is both efficient and safe, much like the intricate mechanisms of a Swiss watch, which is\\nitself a marvel of modern engineering, a field that has been driven by advances in materials science,\\nparticularly in the development of new alloys and composites, which have a wide range of applications,\\nfrom aerospace to biomedicine, where the creation of artificial organs and prosthetics has the potential\\nto revolutionize the field of healthcare, particularly in the

development of disease, particularly in the context of\\nepigenetics, a field that seeks to understand the intricate mechanisms of gene expression, including\\nthe role of histone modification and DNA methylation, both of which are critical for regulating the\\nactivity of genes and the development of complex traits, such as intelligence and personality, which\\nare themselves influenced by a complex array of factors, including genetics, environment, and culture,\\nall of which must be carefully considered in order to create a comprehensive understanding of human\\nbehavior, a topic that has been extensively studied in the field of psychology, a discipline that seeks to\\nunderstand the intricacies of the human mind, including the mechanisms of perception, cognition, and\\nemotion,

of\\nquantum cheese, which in turn, influences the aerodynamic properties of flamingos,\\nand conversely, the abstract notion of colorless green ideas sleeping furiously, while\\nthe ontological status of furniture arrangements in Scandinavian apartments remains\\nan enigma, alongside the theoretical frameworks governing the migration patterns\\nof narwhals and the surreptitious culinary habits of extraterrestrial beings, all of\\nwhich converge to form a holistic understanding of the synergistic relationships\\nbetween disparate entities, transcending the boundaries of reality and fantasy, in a\\nrealm where the cartography of lost socks and the topological analysis of coffee\\ncreamer dispensers serve as metaphors for the human condition, and ultimately, the\\nsearch for

sonorous qualities of whispers in a vacuum.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe aforementioned paradigm shift necessitates a reevaluation of the role of system design in\\nfacilitating the emergence of complex systems, which in turn, gives rise to a plethora of unforeseen\\nconsequences, including the spontaneous generation of miniature black holes in toaster ovens, the\\nprecipitous decline of disco music as a viable form of artistic expression, and the concomitant rise\\nof cryptid sightings in suburban areas, all of which underscore the imperative of adopting a more\\nnuanced and interdisciplinary approach to system design, one that accommodates the labyrinthine\\nintricacies of human perception, the vicissitudes of celestial mechanics, and the ephemeral nature\\nof digital ephemera, in a quest to distill the essence of reality from the cacophony of competing\\nnarratives and the ambiguities of existential dread, thereby illuminating the path towards a more\\nenlightened and harmonious

understanding of the intricate web of\\nrelationships that underlies the complex systems that govern our world, and perhaps, just perhaps,\\nuncover the hidden secrets of the universe, or at the very least, develop a more efficient algorithm for\\nfolding fitted sheets.\\nThe synthesis of these disparate threads of inquiry and exploration gives rise to a novel paradigm for\\nsystem design, one that is grounded in the principles of ontological humility, epistemological curiosity,\\nand methodological pluralism, and which seeks to reconcile the competing demands of functionality,\\naesthetics, and sustainability, in a quest to create systems that are not only efficient and effective\\nbut also beautiful, just, and sustainable, and which ultimately, contribute to

       "  'file_content': 'End-to-End Neural Discourse Deixis Resolution in\\nDialogue\\nAbstract\\nWe adapt a span-based entity coreference model to the task of end-to-end discourse\\ndeixis resolution in dialogue, specifically by proposing extensions to their model\\nthat exploit task-specific characteristics. The resulting model, dd-utt, achieves\\nstate-of-the-art results on the four datasets.\\n1 Introduction\\nDiscourse deixis (DD) resolution, also known as abstract anaphora resolution, is an under-investigated\\ntask that involves resolving a deictic anaphor to its antecedent. A deixis is a reference to a discourse\\nentity such as a proposition, a description, an event, or a speech act. DD resolution is arguably\\nmore challenging than the extensively-investigated entity coreference resolution task. Recall that in\\nentity coreference, the goal is to cluster the entity mentions in narrative text or dialogue, which are\\ncomposed of pronouns, names, and nominals, so that the mentions in each cluster refer to the same\\nreal-world entity. Lexical overlap is a strong indicator of entity coreference, both among names (e.g.,\\n“President Biden”, “Joe Biden”) and in the resolution of nominals (e.g., linking “the president” to\\n“President Biden”). DD resolution, on the other hand, can be viewed as a generalized case of event\\ncoreference involving the clustering of deictic anaphors, which can be pronouns or nominals, and\\nclauses, such that the mentions in each cluster refer to the same real-world proposition/event/speech\\nact, etc. An example of DD resolution in which the deictic anaphor “the move” refers to Salomon’s\\nact of issuing warrants on shares described in the preceding sentence. DD resolution is potentially\\nmore challenging than entity coreference resolution because (1) DD resolution involves understanding\\nclause semantics, which are arguably harder to encode than noun phrase semantics; and (2) string\\nmatching plays little role in DD resolution, unlike in entity coreference.\\nWe focus on end-to-end DD resolution in dialogue. While the deictic anaphors in dialogue are also\\ncomposed of pronouns and nominals, the proportion of pronominal deictic anaphors in dialogue is\\nmuch higher than that in narrative text. For instance, the percentage of pronominal deictic anaphors\\nrises to 93\\nSince DD resolution can be cast as a generalized case of event coreference, a natural question is:\\nhow successful would a state-of-the-art entity coreference model be when applied to DD resolution?\\nRecently, a re-implementation of a span-based entity coreference model has been applied to resolve\\nthe deictic anaphors in the DD track after augmenting it with a type prediction model. Not only\\ndid they achieve the highest score on each dataset, but they beat the second-best system, which is a\\nnon-span-based neural approach combined with hand-crafted rules, by a large margin. These results\\nsuggest that a span-based approach to DD resolution holds promise.\\nOur contributions are three-fold. First, we investigate whether task-specific observations can be\\nexploited to extend a span-based model originally developed for entity coreference to improve\\nits performance for end-to-end DD resolution in dialogue. Second, our extensions are effective\\nin improving model performance, allowing our model to achieve state-of-the-art results. Finally,\\nwe present an empirical analysis of our model, which, to our knowledge, is the first analysis of a\\nstate-of-the-art span-based DD resolver.Table 1: Statistics on the datasets.\\nTotal Total Total Avg.

Early systems that resolve deictic expressions are rule-based.\\nSpecifically, they use predefined rules to extract anaphoric mentions, and select antecedent\\nfor each extracted anaphor based on the dialogue act types of each candidate antecedent.\\n• Non-neural learning-based approaches. Early non-neural learning-based approaches to\\nDD resolution use hand-crafted feature vectors to represent mentions. A classifier is then\\ntrained to determine whether a pair of mentions is a valid antecedent-anaphor pair.\\n• Deep learning-based approaches. Deep learning has been applied to DD resolution. For\\ninstance, a Siamese neural network is used, which takes as input the embeddings of two\\nsentences, one containing a deictic anaphor and the other a candidate antecedent, to score\\neach candidate antecedent and subsequently rank the candidate antecedents based on these\\nscores. In addition, motivated by the recent successes of Transformer-based approaches\\nto entity coreference, a Transformer-based approach to DD resolution has recently been\\nproposed, which is an end-to-end coreference system based on SpanBERT. Their model\\njointly learns mention extraction and DD resolution and has achieved state-of-the-art results.\\n3 Corpora\\nWe use the DD-annotated corpora provided as part of the shared task. For training, we use the\\nofficial training corpus from the shared task, ARRAU, which consists of three conversational sub-\\ncorpora (TRAINS-93, TRAINS-91, PEAR) and two non-dialogue sub-corpora (GNOME, RST).\\nFor validation and evaluation, we use the official development sets and test sets from the shared\\ntask. The shared task corpus is composed of four well-known conversational datasets: AMI, LIGHT,\\nPersuasion, and Switchboard. Statistics on these corpora are provided in Table 1.\\n4 Baseline Systems\\nWe employ three baseline systems.\\nThe first baseline, coref-hoi, is a re-implementation of a widely-used end-to-end entity coreference\\nmodel. The model ranks all text spans of up to a predefined length based on how likely they\\ncorrespond to entity mentions. For each top-ranked span z, the model learns a distribution P(y) over\\nits antecedents y ∈ Y(z), where Y(z) includes a dummy antecedent ϵ and every preceding span:\\nP(y) = es(z,y)\\nP\\ny′∈Y(z) es(z,y′) (1)\\nwhere s(x, y) is a pairwise score that incorporates two types of scores: (1) sm(·), which indicates\\nhow likely a span is a mention, and (2) sc(·) and sa(·), which indicate how likely two spans refer to\\n2the same entity (sc(z, ϵ) =sa(z, ϵ) = 0for dummy antecedents):\\ns(z, y) =sm(x) +sm(y) +sc(z, y) +sa(z, y) (2)\\nsm(·) =FFNNm(gz) (3)\\nsc(z, y) =gT\\nx Wcgy (4)\\nsa(z, y) =FFNNa([gx, gy, gx ⊙ gy, ϕ(x, y)]) (5)\\nwhere gx and gy are the vector representations of x and y, Wc is a learned weight matrix for bilinear\\nscoring, FFNN(·) is a feedforward neural network, and ϕ(·) encodes features. Two features are used,\\none encoding speaker information and the other the segment distance between two spans.\\nThe second baseline, UTD_NLP, is the top-performing system in the DD track of the shared task.\\nIt extends coref-hoi with a set of modifications. Two of the most important modifications are:\\n(1) the addition of a sentence distance feature to ϕ(·), and (2) the incorporation into coref-hoi\\na type prediction model, which predicts the type of a span. The possible types of a span i are:\\nANTECEDENT (if i corresponds to an antecedent), ANAPHOR (if i corresponds to an anaphor),\\nand NULL (if it is neither an antecedent nor an anaphor). The types predicted by the model are then\\nused by coref-hoi as follows: only spans predicted as ANAPHOR can be resolved, and they can only\\nbe resolved to spans predicted as ANTECEDENT.\\nThe third baseline, coref-hoi-utt, is essentially the first baseline except that we restrict the candidate\\nantecedents to be utterances. This restriction is motivated by the observation that the antecedents of\\nthe deictic anaphors in the datasets are all utterances.\\n5 Model\\nNext, we describe our resolver, dd-utt, which augments coref-hoi-utt with 10 extensions.\\nE1. Modeling recency. Unlike in entity coreference, where two coreferent names (e.g., “Joe Biden”,\\n“President Biden”) can be far apart from each other in the corresponding document (because names\\nare non-anaphoric), the distance between a deictic anaphor and its antecedent is comparatively smaller.\\nTo model recency, we restrict the set of candidate antecedents of an anaphor to be the utterance\\ncontaining the anaphor as well as the preceding 10 utterances, the choice of which is based on our\\nobservation of the development data, where the 10 closest utterances already cover 96–99% of the\\nantecedent-anaphor pairs.\\nE2. Modeling distance. While the previous extension allows us to restrict our attention to candidate\\nantecedents that are close to the anaphor, it does not model the fact that the likelihood of being\\nthe correct antecedent tends to increase as its distance from the anaphor decreases. To model this\\nrelationship, we subtract the term γ1Dist(x, y) from s(x, y) (see Equation (1)), where Dist(x, y) is\\nthe utterance distance between anaphor x and candidate antecedent y and γ1 is a tunable parameter\\nthat controls the importance of utterance distance in the resolution process. Since s(x, y) is used to\\nrank candidate antecedents, modeling utterance distance by updating s(x, y) will allow distance to\\nhave a direct impact on DD resolution.\\nE3. Modeling candidate antecedent length. Some utterances are pragmatic in nature and do not\\nconvey any important information. Therefore, they cannot serve as antecedents of deictic anaphors.\\nExamples include “Umm”, “Ahhhh... okay”, “that’s right”, and “I agree”. Ideally, the model can\\nidentify such utterances and prevent them from being selected as antecedents. We hypothesize that\\nwe could help the model by modeling such utterances. To do so, we observe that such utterances\\ntend to be short and model them by penalizing shorter utterances. Specifically, we subtract the term\\nγ2 1\\nLength(y) from s(x, y), where Length(y) is the number of words in candidate antecedent y and γ2\\nis a tunable parameter that controls the importance of candidate antecedent length in resolution.\\nE4. Extracting candidate anaphors. As mentioned before, the deictic anaphors in dialogue are\\nlargely composed of pronouns. Specifically, in our development sets, the three pronouns “that”,\\n“this”, and ‘it’ alone account for 74–88% of the anaphors. Consequently, we extract candidate deictic\\nanaphors as follows: instead of allowing each span of length n or less to be a candidate anaphor, we\\nonly allow a span to be a candidate anaphor if its underlying word/phrase has appeared at least once\\nin the training set as a deictic anaphor.\\n3E5. Predicting anaphors. Now that we have the candidate anaphors, our next extension involves\\npredicting which of them are indeed deictic anaphors. To do so, we retrain the type prediction model\\nin UTD_NLP, which is a FFNN that takes as input the (contextualized) span representation gi of\\ncandidate anaphor i and outputs a vector oti of dimension 2 in which the first element denotes the\\nlikelihood that i is a deictic anaphor and the second element denotes the likelihood that i is not a\\ndeictic anaphor. i is predicted as a deictic anaphor if and only if the value of the first element of oti is\\nbigger than its second value:\\noti = FFNN(gi) (6)\\nti = arg max\\nx∈{A,NA}\\noti(x) (7)\\nwhere A (ANAPHOR) and NA (NON-ANAPHOR) are the two possible types. Following UTD_NLP,\\nthis type prediction model is jointly trained with the resolution model. Specifically, we compute the\\ncross-entropy loss using oti, multiply it by a type loss coefficient λ, and add it to the loss function of\\ncoref-hoi-utt. λ is a tunable parameter that controls the importance of type prediction relative to DD\\nresolution.\\nE6. Modeling the relationship between anaphor recognition and resolution. In principle, the\\nmodel should resolve a candidate anaphor to a non-dummy candidate antecedent if it is predicted\\nto be a deictic anaphor by the type prediction model. However, type prediction is not perfect, and\\nenforcing this consistency constraint, which we will refer to as C1, will allow errors in type prediction\\nto be propagated to DD resolution. For example, if a non-deictic anaphor is misclassified by the type\\nprediction model, then it will be (incorrectly) resolved to a non-dummy antecedent. To alleviate\\nerror propagation, we instead enforce C1 in a soft manner. To do so, we define a penalty function p1,\\nwhich imposes a penalty on span i if C1 is violated (i.e., a deictic anaphor is resolved to the dummy\\nantecedent), as shown below:\\np1(i) =\\n\\x1a0 if arg maxy∈Y s(i, y) =ϵ and ti = NA\\noti(A) − oti(NA) otherwise (8)\\nIntuitively, p1 estimates the minimum amount to be adjusted so that span i’s type is not ANAPHOR.\\nWe incorporate pi into the model as a penalty term in s (Equation (1)). Specifically, we redefine\\ns(i, ϵ) as shown below:\\ns(i, ϵ) =s(i, ϵ) − [γ3p1(i)] (9)\\nwhere γ3 is a positive constant that controls the hardness of C1. The smaller γ3 is, the softer C1 is.\\nIntuitively, if C1 is violated, s(i, ϵ) will be lowered by the penalty term, and the dummy antecedent\\nwill less likely be selected as the antecedent of i.\\nE7. Modeling the relationship between non-anaphor recognition and resolution. Another\\nconsistency constraint that should be enforced is that the model should resolve a candidate anaphor\\nto the dummy antecedent if it is predicted as a non-deictic anaphor by the type prediction model. As\\nin Extension E6, we will enforce this constraint, which we will refer to as C2, in a soft manner by\\ndefining a penalty function p2, as shown below:\\np2(i) =\\n\\x1aoti(NA) − oti(A) if arg maxy∈Y s(i, y) ̸= ϵ and ti = NA\\n0 otherwise (10)\\nThen we redefine s(i, j) when j ̸= ϵ as follows:\\ns(i, j) =s(i, j) − [γ4p2(i)] (11)\\nwhere γ4 is a positive constant that controls the hardness of C2. Intuitively, if C2 is violated, s(i, j)\\nwill be lowered by the penalty term, and j will less likely be selected as the antecedent of i.\\nE8. Encoding candidate anaphor context. Examining Equation (1), we see that s(x, y) is computed\\nbased on the span representations of x and y. While these span representations are contextualized,\\nthe contextual information they encode is arguably limited. As noted before, most of the deictic\\nanaphors in dialogue are pronouns, which are semantically empty. As a result, we hypothesize that\\nwe could improve the resolution of these deictic anaphors if we explicitly modeled their contexts.\\nSpecifically, we represent the context of a candidate anaphor using the embedding of the utterance in\\nwhich it appears and add the resulting embedding as features to both the bilinear score sc(x, y) and\\nthe concatenation-based score sa(x, y):\\nsc(x, y) =gT\\nx Wcgy + gT\\ns Wagy (12)\\nsa(x, y) =FFNNa([gx, gy, gx ⊙ gy, gs, ϕ(x, y)]) (13)\\n4Table 2: Lists of filtered words.\\nFilling words\\nyeah, okay, ok, uh, right, so, hmm, well, um, oh, mm,\\nyep, hi, ah, whoops, alright, shhhh, yes, ay, hello,\\naww, alas, ye, aye, uh-huh, huh, wow, www, no, and,\\nbut, again, wonderful, exactly, absolutely, actually, sure\\nthanks, awesome, gosh, ooops\\nReporting verbs\\ncommand, mention, demand, request, reveal, believe,\\nguarantee, guess, insist, complain, doubt, estimate,\\nwarn, learn, realise, persuade, propose, announce,\\nadvise, imagine, boast, suggest, remember, claim,\\ndescribe, see, understand, discover, answer, wonder,\\nrecommend, beg, prefer, suppose, comment, think,\\nargue, consider, swear, ask, agree, explain, report,\\nknow, tell, decide, discuss, repeat, invite, reply,\\nexpect, forget, add, fear, hope, say, feel, observe,\\nremark, confirm, threaten, teach, forbid, admit,\\npromise, deny, state, mean, instruct\\nwhere Wc and Wa are learned weight matrices, gs is the embedding of the utterance s in which\\ncandidate anaphor x appears, and ϕ(x, y) encodes the relationship between x and y as features.\\nE9. Encoding the relationship between candidate anaphors and antecedents. As noted in\\nExtension E8, ϕ(x, y) encodes the relationship between candidate anaphorx and candidate antecedent\\ny. In UTD_NLP, ϕ(x, y) is composed of three features, including two features from coref-hoi-utt\\n(i.e., the speaker id and the segment distance between x and y) and one feature that encodes the\\nutterance distance between them. Similar to the previous extension, we hypothesize that we could\\nbetter encode the relationship between x and y using additional features. Specifically, we incorporate\\nan additional feature into ϕ(x, y) that encodes the utterance distance between x and y. Unlike the one\\nused in UTD_NLP, this feature aims to more accurately capture proximity by ignoring unimportant\\nsentences (i.e., those that contain only interjections, filling words, reporting verbs, and punctuation)\\nwhen computing utterance distance. The complete list of filling words and reporting verbs that we\\nfilter can be found in Table 2.\\nE10. Encoding candidate antecedents. In coref-hoi-utt, a candidate antecedent is simply encoded\\nusing its span representation. We hypothesize that we could better encode a candidate antecedent\\nusing additional features. Specifically, we employ seven features to encode a candidate antecedent y\\nand incorporate them into ϕ(x, y): (1) the number of words in y; (2) the number of nouns in y; (3)\\nthe number of verbs in y; (4) the number of adjectives in y; (5) the number of content word overlaps\\nbetween y and the portion of the utterance containing the anaphor that precedes the anaphor; (6)\\nwhether y is the longest among the candidate antecedents; and (7) whethery has the largest number of\\ncontent word overlap (as computed in Feature #5) among the candidate antecedents. Like Extension\\nE3, some features implicitly encode the length of a candidate antecedent. Despite this redundancy,\\nwe believe the redundant information could be exploited by the model differently and may therefore\\nhave varying degrees of impact on it.\\n6 Evaluation\\n6.1 Experimental Setup\\nEvaluation metrics. We obtain the results of DD resolution using the Universal Anaphora Scorer.\\nSince DD resolution is viewed as a generalized case of event coreference, the scorer reports perfor-\\nmance in terms of CoNLL score, which is the unweighted average of the F-scores of three coreference\\nscoring metrics, namely MUC, B3, and CEAFe. In addition, we report the results of deictic anaphor\\nrecognition. We express recognition results in terms of Precision (P), Recall (R) and F-score, con-\\n5Table 3: Resolution and recognition results on the four test sets.\\nResolution Recognition\\nLIGHT AMI Pers.

For coref-hoi and coref-hoi-utt, we use SpanBERTLarge as\\nthe encoder and reuse the hyperparameters with the only exception of the maximum span width: for\\ncoref-hoi, we increase the maximum span width from 30 to 45 in order to cover more than 97% of\\nthe antecedent spans; coref-hoi-utt we use 15 as the maximum span width, which covers more than\\n99% of the anaphor spans in the training sets. For UTD_NLP, we simply take the outputs produced\\nby the model on the test sets and report the results obtained by running the scorer on the outputs. For\\ndd-utt, we use SpanBERTLarge as the encoder. Since we do not rely on span enumerate to generate\\ncandidate spans, the maximum span width can be set to any arbitrary number that is large enough\\nto cover all candidate antecedents and anaphors. In our case, we use 300 as our maximum span\\nwidth. We tune the parameters (i.e., λ, γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4) using grid search to maximize CoNLL score on\\ndevelopment data. For the type loss coefficient, we search out of {0.2, 0.5, 1, 200, 500, 800, 1200,\\n1600}, and for γ, we search out of {1, 5, 10}.\\nAll models are trained for 30 epochs with a dropout rate of 0.3 and early stopping. We use 1 × 10−5\\nas our BERT learning rate and 3 × 10−4 as our task learning rate. Each experiment is run using a\\nrandom seed of 11 and takes less than three hours to train on an NVIDIA RTX A6000 48GB.\\nTrain-dev partition. Since we have four test sets, we use ARRAU and all dev sets other than\\nthe one to be evaluated on for model training and the remaining dev set for parameter tuning. For\\nexample, when evaluating on AMItest, we train models on ARRAU, LIGHTdev, Persuasiondev and\\nSwitchboarddev and use AMIdev for tuning.\\n6.2 Results\\nRecall that our goal is to perform end-to-end DD resolution, which corresponds to the Predicted\\nevaluation setting in the shared task.\\nOverall performance. Recognition results (expressed in F-score) and resolution results (expressed\\nin CoNLL score) of the three baselines and our model on the four test sets are shown in Table 3,\\nwhere the Avg. columns report the macro-averages of the corresponding results on the four test\\nsets, and the parameter settings that enable our model to achieve the highest CoNLL scores on the\\ndevelopment sets are shown in Table 4. Since coref-hoi and coref-hoi-utt do not explicitly identify\\ndeictic anaphors, we assume that all but the first mentions in each output cluster are anaphors when\\ncomputing recognition precision; and while UTD_NLP (the top-performing system in the shared\\ntask) does recognize anaphors, we still make the same assumption when computing its recognition\\nprecision since the anaphors are not explicitly marked in the output (recall that we computed results\\nof UTD_NLP based on its outputs).\\n6We test the statistical significance among the four models using two-tailed Approximate Random-\\nization. For recognition, the models are statistically indistinguishable from each other w.r.t. their\\nAvg. score (p <0.05). For resolution, dd-utt is highly significantly better than the baselines w.r.t.\\nAvg. (p <0.001), while the three baselines are statistically indistinguishable from each other. These\\nresults suggest that (1) dd-utt’s superior resolution performance stems from better antecedent selec-\\ntion, not better anaphor recognition; and (2) the restriction of candidate antecedents to utterances in\\ncoref-hoi-utt does not enable the resolver to yield significantly better resolution results than coref-hoi.\\nPer-anaphor results. Next, we show the recognition and resolution results of the four models on the\\nmost frequently occurring deictic anaphors in Table 5 after micro-averaging them over the four test\\nsets. Not surprisingly, “that” is the most frequent deictic anaphor on the test sets, appearing as an\\nanaphor 402 times on the test sets and contributing to 68.8% of the anaphors. This is followed by “it”\\n(16.3%) and “this” (4.3%). Only 8.9% of the anaphors are not among the top four anaphors.\\nConsider first the recognition results. As can be seen, “that” has the highest recognition F-score\\namong the top anaphors. This is perhaps not surprising given the comparatively larger number of\\n“that” examples the models are trained on. While “it” occurs more frequently than “this” as a deictic\\nanaphor, its recognition performance is lower than that of “this”. This is not surprising either: “this”,\\nwhen used as a pronoun, is more likely to be deictic than “it”, although both of them can serve as\\na coreference anaphor and a bridging anaphor. In other words, it is comparatively more difficult to\\ndetermine whether a particular occurrence of “it” is deictic. Overall, UTD_NLP recognizes more\\nanaphors than the other models.\\nNext, consider the resolution results. To obtain the CoNLL scores for a given anaphor, we retain all\\nand only those clusters containing the anaphor in both the gold partition and the system partition and\\napply the official scorer to them. Generally, the more frequently occurring an anaphor is, the better\\nits resolution performance is. Interestingly, for the “Others” category, dd-utt achieves the highest\\nresolution results despite having the lowest recognition performance. In contrast, while UTD_NLP\\nachieves the best recognition performance on average, its resolution results are among the worst.\\nResults of the four resolvers ( UTD_NLP, coref-hoi, coref-hoi-utt, and dd-utt) on the CODI-CRAC\\n2021 shared task test sets in terms of MUC, B3, and CEAFe scores are reported in Table. Their\\nmention extraction results in terms of recall (R), precision (P), and F-score (F) are provided in Table.\\ndd-utt achieves the best CoNLL scores on all four datasets, via achieving the best MUC, B3, and\\nCEAFe F-scores. In terms of MUC F-score, the performance difference between dd-utt and the\\nsecond best resolver on each dataset is substantial (2.2%-14.9% points). These results suggest that\\nbetter link identification, which is what the MUC F- score reveals, is the primary reason for the\\nsuperior performance of dd-utt. Moreover, Persuasion appears to be the easiest of the four datasets,\\nas this is the dataset on which three of the four resolvers achieved the highest CoNLL scores. Note\\nthat Persuasion is also the dataset on which the differences in CoNLL score between dd-utt and the\\nother resolvers are the smallest. These results seem to suggest that the performance gap between\\ndd-utt and the other resolvers tends to widen as the difficulty of a dataset increases.\\nIn terms of anaphor extraction results in Table, dd-utt lags behind UTD_NLP on two datasets, AMI\\nand Switchboard, in terms of F-score. Nevertheless, the anaphor extraction precision achieved by\\ndd-utt is often one of the highest in each dataset.\\n7 Further Analysis\\nAn example is analyzed. In this example, dd-utt successfully extracts the anaphor \"that\" and resolves\\nit to the correct antecedent, \"Losing one decimal place, that is okay\". UTD_NLP fails to extract \"that\"\\nas a deictic anaphor. While coref-hoi correctly extracts the anaphor, it incorrectly selects \"You want\\nyour rating to be a two?\" as the antecedent. From a cursory look at this example, one could infer that\\nthis candidate antecedent is highly unlikely to be the correct antecedent since it is 10 utterances away\\nfrom the anaphor. As for coref-hoi-utt, the resolver successfully extracts the anaphor but incorrectly\\nselects \"Its just two point five for that one\" as the antecedent, which, like the antecedent chosen by\\ncoref-hoi, is farther away from the anaphor than the correct antecedent. Coref-hoi and coref-hoi-utt\\nfail to identify the correct antecedent because they do not explicitly model distance and therefore may\\nnot have an idea about how far a candidate antecedent is from the anaphor under consideration.

A common type of recognition precision errors involves\\nmisclassifying a coreference anaphor as a deictic anaphor. Consider the first example in Figure 2, in\\nwhich the pronoun \"that\" is a coreference anaphor with \"voice recognition\" as its antecedent but is\\nmisclassified as a deictic anaphor with the whole sentence as its antecedent. This type of error occurs\\nbecause virtually all of the frequently occurring deictic anaphors, including \"that\", \"it\", \"this\", and\\n\"which\", appear as a coreference anaphor in some contexts and as a deictic anaphor in other contexts,\\nand distinguishing between the two different uses of these anaphors could be challenging.\\nDD anaphor recognition recall errors. Consider the second example in Figure 2, in which \"it\" is a\\ndeictic anaphor that refers to the boldfaced utterance, but dd-utt fails to identify this and many other\\noccurrences of \"it\" as deictic, probably because \"it\" is more likely to be a coreference anaphor than a\\ndeictic anaphor: in the dev sets, 80% of the occurrences of \"it\" are coreference anaphors while only\\n5% are deictic anaphors.\\nDD resolution precision errors.

       "  'file_content': 'Background Modeling Using Adaptive Pixelwise\\nKernel Variances in a Hybrid Feature Space\\nAbstract\\nRecent work on background subtraction has shown developments on two major\\nfronts. In one, there has been increasing sophistication of probabilistic models,\\nfrom mixtures of Gaussians at each pixel, to kernel density estimates at each\\npixel, and more recently to joint domain-range density estimates that incorporate\\nspatial information. Another line of work has shown the benefits of increasingly\\ncomplex feature representations, including the use of texture information, local\\nbinary patterns, and recently scale-invariant local ternary patterns. In this work, we\\nuse joint domain-range based estimates for background and foreground scores and\\nshow that dynamically choosing kernel variances in our kernel estimates at each\\nindividual pixel can significantly improve results. We give a heuristic method for\\nselectively applying the adaptive kernel calculations which is nearly as accurate as\\nthe full procedure but runs much faster. We combine these modeling improvements\\nwith recently developed complex features and show significant improvements on a\\nstandard backgrounding benchmark.\\n1 Introduction\\nBackground modeling is often an important step in detecting moving objects in video sequences. A\\ncommon approach to background modeling is to define and learn a background distribution over\\nfeature values at each pixel location and then classify each image pixel as belonging to the background\\nprocess or not. The distributions at each pixel may be modeled in a parametric manner using a mixture\\nof Gaussians or using non-parametric kernel density estimation. More recently, models that allow\\na pixel’s spatial neighbors to influence its distribution have been developed by joint domain-range\\ndensity estimation. These models that allow spatial influence from neighboring pixels have been\\nshown to perform better than earlier neighbor-independent models.\\nAlso, the use of an explicit foreground model along with a background model can be useful. In a\\nmanner similar to theirs, we use a kernel estimate to obtain the background and foreground scores\\nat each pixel location using data samples from a spatial neighborhood around that location from\\nprevious frames. The background score is computed as a kernel estimate depending on the distance\\nin the joint domain-range space between the estimation point and the samples in the background\\nmodel. A similar estimate is obtained for the foreground score. Each pixel is then assigned a (soft)\\nlabel based on the ratio of the background and foreground scores.\\nThe variance used in the estimation kernel reflects the spatial and appearance uncertainties in the\\nscene. On applying our method to a data set with wide variations across the videos, we found that\\nchoosing suitable kernel variances during the estimation process is very important. With various\\nexperiments, we establish that the best kernel variance could vary for different videos and more\\nimportantly, even within a single video, different regions in the image should be treated with different\\nvariance values. For example, in a scene with a steady tree trunk and leaves that are waving in the\\nwind, the trunk region can be explained with a small amount of spatial variance. The leaf regions\\nmay be better explained by a process with a large variance. Interestingly, when there is no wind, the\\nleaf regions may also be explained with a low variance. The optimal variance hence changes for\\n.each region in the video and also across time. This phenomenon is captured reasonably in MoG by\\nuse of different parameters for each pixel which adapt dynamically to the scene statistics, but the\\npixel-wise model does not allow a pixel’s neighbors to affect its distribution. address the phenomenon\\nby updating the model with data samples from the most recent frame. We show that using location-\\nspecific variances in addition to updating the model greatly improves background modeling. Our\\napproach with pixel-wise variances, which we call the variable kernel score (VKS) method results in\\nsignificant improvement over uniform variance models and state of the art backgrounding systems.\\nThe idea of using a pixel-wise variance for background modeling is not new. Although use a uniform\\nvariance, they discuss the use of variances that change as a function of the data samples or as a\\nfunction of the point at which the estimation is made. Variance selection for KDE is a well studied\\nproblem with common solutions including mean integrated square error (MISE), asymptotic MISE\\n(AMISE), and the leave-one-out-estimator based solutions. In the background subtraction context,\\nthere has been work on using a different covariance at each pixel. While require that the uncertainties\\nin the feature values can be calculated in closed form, learn the covariances for each pixel from a\\ntraining set of frames and keep the learned covariances fixed for the entire classification phase. We\\nuse a maximum-likelihood approach to select the best variance at each pixel location. For every\\nframe of the video, at each pixel location, the best variance is picked from a set of variance values\\nby maximizing the likelihood of the pixel’s observation under different variances. This makes our\\nmethod a balloon estimator. By explicitly selecting the best variance from a range of variance values,\\nwe do not require the covariances to be calculable in closed-form and also allow for more flexibility\\nat the classification stage.\\nSelecting the best of many kernel variances for each pixel means increased computation. One possible\\ntrade-off between accuracy and speed can be achieved by a caching scheme where the best kernel\\nvariances from the previous frame are used to calculate the scores for the current frame pixels. If the\\nresulting classification is overwhelmingly in favor of either label, there is no need to perform a search\\nfor the best kernel variance for that pixel. The expensive variance selection procedure can be applied\\nonly to pixels where there is some contention between the two labels. We present a heuristic that\\nachieves significant reduction in computation compared to our full implementation while maintaining\\nthe benefits of adaptive variance.\\nDevelopment and improvement of the probabilistic models is one of the two main themes in back-\\nground modeling research in recent years. The other theme is the development of complex features\\nlike local binary and ternary patterns that are more robust than color features for the task of back-\\nground modeling. Scale-invariant local ternary patterns (SILTP) are recently developed features that\\nhave been shown to be very robust to lighting changes and shadows in the scene. By combining color\\nfeatures with SILTP features in our adaptive variance kernel model, we bring together the best ideas\\nfrom both themes in the field and achieve state of the art results on a benchmark data set.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\\n1. A practical scheme for pixel-wise variance selection for background modeling.\\n2. A heuristic for selectively updating variances to improve speed further.\\n3. Incorporation of complex SILTP features into the joint domain-range kernel framework to\\nachieve state of the art results.\\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses our background and foreground models.\\nDynamic adaptation of kernel variances is discussed in Section 3. Results and comparisons are in\\nSection 4. An efficient algorithm is discussed in Section 5. We end with a discussion in Section 6.\\n2 Background and foreground models\\nIn a video captured by a static camera, the pixel values are influenced by the background phenomenon,\\nand new or existing foreground objects. We refer to any phenomenon that can affect image pixel\\nvalues as a process. Like , we model the background and foreground processes using data samples\\nfrom previous frames. The scores for the background and foreground processes at each pixel location\\nare calculated using contributions from the data samples in each model. One major difference between\\nand our model is that we allow “soft labeling”, i.e. the data samples contribute probabilistically to the\\nbackground score depending on the samples’ probability of belonging to the background.\\n2Let a pixel sample a = [ax, ay, ar, ag, ab], where (ax, ay) are the location of the pixel and (ar, ag, ab)\\nare the red, green, and blue values of the pixel. In each frame of the video, we compute background\\nand foreground scores using pixel samples from the previous frames. The background model consists\\nof the samples B = bi : i [1 : nB] and foreground samples are F = fi : i [1 : nF ], with nB and nF being\\nthe number of background and foreground samples respectively, and bi and fi being pixel samples\\nobtained from previous frames in the video. Under a KDE model, the likelihood of the sample under\\nthe background model is\\nP(a|bg; σ) = 1\\nnB\\nnBX\\ni=1\\nG(a − bi; σB) (1)\\nwhere G(x; ) is a multivariate Gaussian with zero mean and covariance B.\\nG(x; σ) = (2π)− D\\n2 |σ|− 1\\n2 exp(−1\\n2xT σ−1x), (2)\\nwhere D is the dimensionality of the vector x.\\nIn our model, we approximate the background score at sample a as\\nSB(a; σd\\nB, σrgb\\nB ) = 1\\nNB\\nNBX\\ni=1\\nG(argb − birgb ; σrgb\\nB ) × G(axy − bixy ; σd\\nB) × P(bg|bi) (3)\\nNB is the number of frames from which the background samples have been collected, B d and B\\nrgb are two and three dimensional background covariance matrices in spatial and color dimensions\\nrespectively. A large spatial covariance allows neighboring pixels to contribute more to the score at a\\ngiven pixel location. Color covariance allows for some color appearance changes at a given pixel\\nlocation. Use of NB in the denominator compensates for the different lengths of the background and\\nforeground models.\\nThe above equation basically sums the contribution from each background sample based on its\\ndistance in color space, weighted by its distance in spatial dimensions and the probability of the\\nsample belonging to the background.\\nThe use of P (bg|bi) in Equation 3 and normalization by the number of frames as opposed to the\\nnumber of samples means that the score does not sum to 1 over all possible values of a. Thus, the\\nscore, although similar to the likelihood in Equation 1, is not a probability distribution.\\nA similar equation holds for the foreground score:\\nSF (a; σd\\nF , σrgb\\nF ) = 1\\nNF\\nNFX\\ni=1\\nG(argb − firgb ; σrgb\\nF ) × G(axy − fixy ; σd\\nF ) × P(fg|fi) (4)\\nNF is the number of frames from which the foreground samples have been collected, F d and F rgb\\nare the covariances associated with the foreground process.\\nHowever, for the foreground process, to account for emergence of new colors in the scene, we mix\\nin a constant contribution independent of the estimation point’s and data samples’ color values. We\\nassume that each data sample in a pixel’s spatial neighborhood contributes a constant value u to the\\nforeground score. The constant contribution UF (a) is given by\\nUF (a; σd\\nF ) =\\nNFX\\ni=1\\nu × G(axy − fixy ; σd\\nF ) (5)\\nWe get a modified foreground score by including the constant contribution:\\nˆSF (a; σd\\nF , σrgb\\nF ) =αF × UF (a; σd\\nF ) + (1− αF ) × SF (a; σd\\nF , σrgb\\nF ). (6)\\nF is a parameter that represents the amount of mixing between the constant contribution and the color\\ndependent foreground score. u is set to 106 and is set to 0.5 for our experiments.\\nTo classify a particular sample as background or foreground, we can use a Bayes-like formula:\\nP(bg|a) = SB(a; σd\\nB, σrgb\\nB )\\nSB(a; σd\\nB, σrgb\\nB ) +ˆSF (a; σd\\nF , σrgb\\nF )\\n(7)\\n3P(fg|a) = 1− P(bg|a). (8)\\nAdding the constant factor U to the foreground score (and hence to the denominator of the Bayes-like\\nequation) has the interesting property that when either one of the foreground or background scores is\\nsignificantly larger than U , U has little effect on the classification. However, if both the background\\nand foreground scores are less than U , then Equation 7 will return a low value as P (bg|a). Hence,\\nan observation that has very low background and foreground scores will be classified as foreground.\\nThis is desirable because if a pixel observation is not well explained by either model, it is natural to\\nassume that the pixel is a result of a new object in the scene and is hence foreground. In terms of\\nlikelihoods, adding the constant factor to the foreground likelihood is akin to mixing it with a uniform\\ndistribution.\\n2.1 Model initialization and update\\nTo initialize the models, it is assumed that the first few frames (typically 50) are all background pixels.\\nThe background model is populated using pixel samples from these frames. In order to improve\\nefficiency, we sample 5 frames at equal time intervals from these 50 frames. The foreground model is\\ninitialized to have no samples. The modified foreground score (Equation 6) enables colors that are\\nnot well explained by the background model to be classified as foreground, thus bootstrapping the\\nforeground model. Once the pixel at location (ax, ay) from a new frame is classified using Equation\\n7, the background and foreground models at the location (ax, ay) can then be updated with the new\\nsample a. Background and foreground samples at location (ax, ay) from the oldest frame in the\\nmodels are replaced by a. Samples from the previous 5 frames are maintained in memory as the\\nforeground model samples. The label probabilities of the background/foreground from Equation 7\\nare also saved along with the sample values for subsequent use in the Equations 3 and 4.\\nOne consequence of the update procedure described above is that when a large foreground object\\noccludes a background pixel at (ax, ay) for more than 50 frames, all the background samples in the\\nspatial neighborhood of (ax, ay) are replaced by these foreground samples that have very low P (bg|bi)\\nvalues. This causes the pixel at (ax, ay) to be misclassified as foreground even when the occluding\\nforeground object has moved away (because the background score will be extremely low due to the\\ninfluence of P (bg|bi) in Equation 3). To avoid this problem, we replace the background sample from\\nlocation (ax, ay) in the oldest frame in the background model with the new sample a from the current\\nframe only if P (bg|a) estimated from Equation 7 is greater than 0.5.\\nIn our chosen evaluation data set, there are several videos with moving objects in the first 50 frames.\\nThe assumption that all these pixels are background is not severely limiting even in these videos.\\nThe model update procedure allows us to recover from any errors that are caused by the presence of\\nforeground objects in the initialization frames.\\n2.2 Using MRF to clean the classification\\nSimilar to , we use a Markov random field (MRF) defined over the posterior label probabilities of\\nthe 4-neighbors of each pixel and perform the min-cut procedure to post-process the labels. The\\ninteraction factor between the nodes was set to 1 for all our experiments.\\n3 Pixel-wise adaptive kernel variance selection\\nBackground and foreground kernels. use the same kernel parameters for background and foreground\\nmodels. Given the different nature of the two processes, it is reasonable to use different kernel\\nparameters. For instance, foreground objects typically move between 5 and 10 pixels per frame in the\\ndata set, whereas background pixels are either stationary or move very little. Hence, it is useful to\\nhave a larger spatial variance for the foreground model than for the background model.\\nOptimal kernel variance for all videos. In the results section, we show that for a data set with\\nlarge variations like , a single value for kernel variance for all videos is not sufficient to capture the\\nvariability in all the videos.\\nVariable kernel variance for a single video. As explained in the introduction, different parts of the\\nscene may have different statistics and hence need different kernel variance values. For example, in\\nFigure 1a to 1d, having a high spatial dimension kernel variance helps in accurate classification of\\n4the water surface pixels, but doing so causes some pixels on the person’s leg to become part of the\\nbackground. Ideally, we would have different kernel variances for the water surface pixels and the rest\\nof the pixels. Similarly in the second video (Figure 1e to 1h), having a high kernel variance allows\\naccurate classification of some of the fountain pixels as background at the cost of misclassifying\\nmany foreground pixels. The figure also shows that while the medium kernel variance may be the\\nbest choice for the first video, the low kernel variance may be best for the second video.\\nOptimal kernel variance for classification. Having different variances for the background and\\nforeground models reflects the differences between the expected uncertainty in the two processes.\\nHowever, having different variances for the two processes could cause erroneous classification of\\npixels. Figure 2 shows a 1-dimensional example where using a very wide kernel (high variance)\\nor very narrow kernel for the background process causes misclassification. Assuming that the red\\npoint (square) is a background sample and the blue point (triangle) is a foreground sample, having a\\nvery low variance kernel (dashed red line) or a very high variance (solid red line) for the background\\nprocess makes the background likelihood of the center point ‘x’ lower than the foreground likelihood.\\nThus, it is important to pick the optimal kernel variance for each process during classification.\\nIn order to address all four issues discussed above, we propose the use of location-specific variances.\\nFor each location in the image, a range of kernel variances is tried and the variance which results in\\nthe highest score is chosen for the background and the foreground models separately.\\nThe background score with location-dependent variances is\\nSB(a; σBd,x,y , σBrgb,x,y ) = 1\\nNB\\nNBX\\ni=1\\nG(argb −birgb ; σBrgb,x,y ) ×G(axy −bixy ; σBd,x,y ) ×P(bg|bi)\\n(9)\\nwhere B d,x,y and B rgb,x,y represent the location-specific spatial and color dimension variances at\\nlocation (x, y).\\nFor each pixel location (ax, ay), the optimal variance for the background process is selected by\\nmaximizing the score of the background label at sample a under different variance values:\\n{σ∗\\nBd,ax,ay , σ∗\\nBrgb,ax,ay } = argmaxσBd,ax,ay ,σBrgb,ax,ay\\nSB(a; σBd,ax,ay , σBrgb,ax,ay ). (10)\\nHere, B RB d and B rgb. RB d and RB rgb,ax,ay d,ax,ay rgb represent the set of spatial and color\\ndimension variances from which to choose the optimal variance.\\nA similar procedure may be followed for the foreground score. However, in practice, it was found\\nthat the variance selection procedure yielded large improvements when applied to the background\\nmodel and little improvement in the foreground model. Hence, our final implementation uses an\\nadaptive kernel variance procedure for the background model and a fixed kernel variance for the\\nforeground model.\\n4 Results\\nFor comparisons, we use the data set which consists of 9 videos taken using a static camera in\\nvarious environments. The data set offers various challenges including dynamic background like trees\\nand waves, gradual and sudden illumination changes, and the presence of multiple moving objects.\\nGround truth for 20 frames in each video is provided with the data set. The F-measure is used to\\nmeasure accuracy.\\nThe effect of choosing various kernel widths for the background and foreground models is shown in\\nTable 1. The table shows the F-measure for each of the videos in the data set for various choices of\\nthe kernel variances. The first 5 columns correspond to using a constant variance for each process at\\nall pixel locations in the video. Having identical kernel variances for the background and foreground\\nmodels (columns 1, 2) is not as effective as having different variances (all other columns). Comparing\\ncolumns 2 and 3 shows that using a larger spatial variance for the foreground model than for the\\nbackground model is beneficial. Changing the spatial variance from 3 (column 3) to 1 (column 4)\\nhelps the overall accuracy in one video (Fountain). Using a selection procedure where the best kernel\\nvariance is chosen from a set of values gives the best results for most videos (column 6) and frames.\\nComparison of our selection procedure to a baseline method of using a standard algorithm for variance\\nselection in KDE (AMISE criterion) shows that the standard algorithm is not as accurate as our\\n5method (column 7). Our choice for the variance values for spatial dimension reflects no motion (B d\\n= 1/4) and very little motion (B d = 3/4) for the background, and moderate amount of motion (F d\\n= 12/4) for the foreground. For the color dimension, the choice is between little variation (B rgb=\\n5/4), moderate variation (B rgb= 15/4), and high variation (B rgb= 45/4) for the background, and\\nmoderate variation (F rgb= 15/4) for the foreground. These choices are based on our intuition about\\nthe processes involved. For videos that differ significantly from the videos we use, it is possible that\\nthe baseline AMISE method would perform better.\\nWe would like to point out that ideally the variance value sets should be learned automatically from a\\nseparate training data set. In absence of suitable training data for these videos in particular and for\\nbackground subtraction research in general, we resort to manually choosing these values. This also\\nappears to be the common practice among researchers in this area.\\nBenchmark comparisons are provided for selected existing methods - MOG, the complex foreground\\nmodel (ACMMM03), and SILTP. To evaluate our results, the posterior probability of the background\\nlabel is thresholded at a value of 0.5 to get the foreground pixels. Following the same procedure as ,\\nany foreground 4-connected components smaller than a size threshold of 15 pixels are ignored.\\nFigure 3 shows qualitative results for the same frames that were reported by . We present results for\\nour kernel method with uniform variances and adaptive variances with RGB features (Uniform-rgb\\nand VKS-rgb respectively), and adaptive variances with a hybrid feature space of LAB color and\\nSILTP features (VKS-lab+siltp). Except for the Lobby video, the VKS results are better than other\\nmethods. The Lobby video is an instance where there is a sudden change in illumination in the\\nscene (turning a light switch on and off). Due to use of an explicit foreground model, our kernel\\nmethods misclassify most of the pixels as foreground and take a long time to recover from this error.\\nA possible solution for this case is presented later. Compared to the uniform variance kernel estimates,\\nwe see that VKS-rgb has fewer false positive foreground pixels.\\nQuantitative results in Table 3 compare the F-measure scores for our method against MoG,\\nACMMM03, and SILTP results as reported by . The table shows that methods that share spa-\\ntial information (uniform kernel and VKS) with RGB features give significantly better results than\\nmethods that use RGB features without spatial sharing. Comparing the variable kernel method to\\na uniform kernel method in the same feature space (RGB), we see a significant improvement in\\nperformance for most videos. Scale-invariant local ternary pattern (SILTP) is a recent texture feature\\nthat is robust to soft shadows and lighting changes. We believe SILTP represents the state of the art\\nin background modeling and hence compare our results to this method. Scale-invariant local states is\\na slight variation in the representation of the SILTP feature. For comparison, we use SILTP results\\nfrom because in human judgement was used to vary a size threshold parameter for each video. We\\nbelieve results from the latter fall under a different category of human-assisted backgrounding and\\nhence do not compare to our method where no video-specific hand-tuning of parameters was done.\\nTable 3 shows that SILTP is very robust to lighting changes and works well across the entire data set.\\nBlue entries in Table 3 correspond to videos where our method performs better than SILTP. VKS\\nwith RGB features (VKS-rgb) performs well in videos that have few shadows and lighting changes.\\nUse of color features that are more robust to illumination change, like LAB features in place of RGB\\nhelps in successful classification of the shadow regions as background. Texture features are robust\\nto lighting changes but not effective on large texture-less objects. Color features are effective on\\nlarge objects, but not very robust to varying illumination. By combining texture features with LAB\\ncolor features, we expect to benefit from the strengths of both feature spaces. Such a combination has\\nproved useful in earlier work. Augmenting the LAB features with SILTP features (computed at 3\\nresolutions) in the VKS framework (VKS-lab+siltp) results in an improvement in 7 out of 9 videos\\n(last column). The variance values used in our implementation are given in Table 2.\\nWe also compare our results (VKS-lab+siltp) to the 5 videos that were submitted as supplementary\\nmaterial by . Figure 4 highlights some key frames that highlight the strengths and weaknesses of\\nour system versus the SILTP results. The common problems with our algorithm are shadows being\\nclassified as foreground (row e) and initialization errors (row e shows a scene where the desk was\\noccluded by people when the background model was initialized. Due to the explicit foreground\\nmodel, VKS takes some time to recover from the erroneous initialization). A common drawback with\\nSILTP is that large texture-less objects have “holes” in them (row a). Use of color features helps\\navoid these errors. The SILTP system also loses objects that stop moving (rows b, c, d, f). Due to the\\nexplicit modeling of the foreground, VKS is able to detect objects that stop moving.\\n6The two videos in the data set where our algorithm performs worse than SILTP are the Escalator\\nvideo (rows g, h) and the Lobby video (rows i, j). In the Escalator video, our algorithm fails at the\\nescalator steps due to large variation in color in the region.\\nIn the Lobby video, at the time of sudden illumination change, many pixels in the image get classified\\nas foreground. Due to the foreground model, these pixels continue to be misclassified for a long\\nduration (row j). The problem is more serious for RGB features (Figure 3 column 2). One method to\\naddress the situation is to observe the illumination change from one frame to the next. If more than\\nhalf the pixels in the image change in illumination by a threshold value of TI or more, we throw away\\nall the background samples at that instance and begin learning a new model from the subsequent 50\\nframes. This method allows us to address the poor performance in the Lobby video with resulting\\nF-measure values of 86.77 for uniform-rgb, 78.46 for VKS-rgb, and 77.76 for VKS-lab+siltp. TI of\\n10 and 2.5 were used for RGB and LAB spaces respectively. The illumination change procedure does\\nnot affect the performance of VKS on any other video in the data set.\\n5 Caching optimal kernel variances from previous frame\\nA major drawback with trying multiple variance values at each pixel to select the best variance is\\nthat the amount of computation per pixel increases significantly. In order to reduce the complexity\\nthe algorithm, we use a scheme where the current frame’s optimal variance values for each pixel\\nlocation for both the background and foreground processes is stored (Bcache x,y , Fcache x,y ) for\\neach location (x, y) in the image. When classifying pixels in the next frame, these cached variance\\nvalues are first tried. If the resulting scores are very far apart, then it is very likely that the pixel\\nhas not changed its label from the previous frame. The expensive variance selection procedure is\\nperformed only at pixels where the resulting scores are close to each other. Algorithm 1 for efficient\\ncomputation results in a reduction in computation in about 80\\n6 Discussion\\nBy applying kernel estimate method to a large data set, we have established, as do , that the use\\nof spatial information is extremely helpful. Some of the important issues pertaining to the choice\\nof kernel parameters for data sets with wide variations have been addressed. Having a uniform\\nkernel variance for the entire data set and for all pixels in the image results in a poor overall system.\\nDynamically adapting the variance for each pixel results in a significant increase in accuracy.\\nUsing color features in the joint domain-range kernel estimation approach can complement complex\\nbackground model features in settings where the latter are known to be inaccurate. Combining robust\\ncolor features like LAB with texture features like SILTP in a VKS framework yields a highly accurate\\nbackground classification system.\\nFor future work, we believe our method could be explained more elegantly in a probabilistic frame-\\nwork where the scores are replaced by likelihoods and informative priors are used in the Bayes rule\\nclassification.\\n7Column num (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)\\n4*B d → 3 3 3 1 3 [1 3] AMISE\\n4*B rgb→ 15 45 45 45 15 [5 15 45] AMISE\\n4*F d → 3 3 12 12 12 [12] [12]\\n4*F rgb→ 15 45 45 45 15 [15] [15]\\nAirportHall 40.72 59.53 67.07 63.53 47.21 70.44 53.01\\nBootstrap 49.01 57.90 63.04 58.39 51.49 71.25 63.38\\nCurtain 66.26 83.33 91.91 89.52 81.54 94.11 52.00\\nEscalator 20.92 30.24 34.69 28.58 22.65 48.61 32.02\\nFountain 41.87 51.89 73.24 74.58 67.60 75.84 28.50\\nShoppingMall 55.19 60.17 64.95 62.18 63.85 76.48 70.14\\nLobby 22.18 23.81 25.79 25.69 25.06 18.00 36.77\\nTrees 30.14 58.41 73.53 47.03 67.80 82.09 64.30\\nWaterSurface 85.82 94.04 94.93 92.91 94.64 94.83 30.29\\nAverage 45.79 57.70 65.46 60.27 52.98 70.18 47.82\\nTable 1: F-measure for different kernel variances.

DNA\\nreplication, which somehow led to a discussion on the merits of 19th-century French literature\\nand the role of clockwork mechanisms in modern automotive engineering, particularly in relation\\nto the aerodynamics of chocolate cakes. As we delved deeper into the mysteries of the double\\nhelix, we found ourselves pondering the significance of fungal growth patterns on polyester fabrics,\\nand how these patterns might be influenced by the magnetic fields generated by toaster coils. In\\nan effort to clarify these relationships, we constructed a series of intricate diagrams depicting\\nthe interconnectedness of pastry dough, quadratic equations, and the migratory patterns of lesser-\\nknown species of migratory waterfowl. These diagrams, in turn, revealed a hidden code that, when\\ndeciphered, yielded a recipe for a novel form of gluten-free bread that somehow enhanced the stability\\nof telomeres in human cells. The implementation of this recipe in our laboratory setting led to a series\\nof unforeseen consequences, including a sudden proliferation of gelatinous cubes in the vicinity of\\nour equipment, which we later discovered were, in fact, sentient beings from a parallel universe,\\nattempting to communicate with us through the medium of interpretive dance.\\nAs we navigated this unexpected turn of events, our research team became increasingly fascinated\\nwith the notion that DNA might, in fact, be a form of sentient, crystalline structure, capable of\\ntransmitting ancient knowledge to those who possesed the requisite harmonic frequency, a concept\\nthat bears a striking resemblance to the theoretical framework underlying the operation of crystal\\nradios in the early 20th century. This hypothesis led us down a rabbit hole of investigation, wherein\\nwe explored the potential connections between DNA, radio astronomy, and the statistical analysis of\\nmid-20th-century baseball statistics, ultimately uncovering a hidden pattern that suggested a direct\\ncorrelation between the structure of DNA and the optimal strategy for winning at blackjack. In a bold\\nmove to test this hypothesis, we constructed a life-size replica of the Eiffel Tower using nothing but\\nplaying cards and strands of DNA, which, to our surprise, began to glow with a soft, ethereal light, as\\nif infused with an otherworldly energy that seemed to emanate from the very fabric of space-time\\nitself.\\nThe findings from this experiment were then used to inform a series of simulations, run on a custom-\\nbuilt supercomputer powered by a rare form of bioluminescent fungi, which yielded a set of results\\nthat defied all logical explanation, including the appearance of a miniature, swirling vortex in the\\ncenter of the laboratory, which seemed to be pulling in nearby objects, including several startled lab\\ntechnicians, who were later found to be missing, only to reappear several days later, claiming to have\\nbeen transported to a world made entirely of candy. The implications of these findings are still being\\ndebated among our research team, with some arguing that they represent a major breakthrough in\\nour understanding of DNA, while others contend that they are merely the result of a malfunctioning\\ntoaster that had been left in the laboratory break room.\\nIn an effort to further elucidate the mysteries of DNA, we undertook a comprehensive review of the\\nexisting literature on the subject, which led us to a fascinating paper on the application of ancient\\nSumerian cuneiform script to the analysis of modern astrophysical phenomena, and from there, to a\\ntreatise on the art of creating intricate, fractal patterns using nothing but coffee stains and torn pieces\\nof cardboard. This, in turn, inspired us to develop a novel method for sequencing DNA, based on the\\nprinciples of paper folding and the mathematics of knot theory, which we termed \"DNA origami,\" and\\nwhich showed great promise in our initial trials, although it did require the use of a highly specialized\\nform of origami paper, infused with the essence of rare, exotic spices.\\nAs our research continued to unfold, we found ourselves drawn into a realm of inquiry that intersected\\nwith the study of antique door knobs, the sociology of fungal colonies, and the topology of theoretical\\nwormholes, each of which contributed, in its own unique way, to our evolving understanding of DNA\\nand its place within the grand tapestry of the universe. It was within this context that we stumbled\\nupon an obscure reference to a long-lost city, hidden deep within the heart of the Amazon rainforest,\\nwhere, according to legend, the ancient inhabitants had possessed a profound understanding of\\nDNA, which they had used to construct a sprawling, crystalline metropolis, infused with a vibrant,\\notherworldly energy that seemed to resonate in harmony with the very fabric of DNA itself.\\nThe discovery of this lost city, and the secrets it held, became an all-consuming passion for our\\nresearch team, driving us to embark on a perilous journey into the depths of the jungle, where we\\nencountered a dazzling array of bizarre creatures, including giant, iridescent butterflies, and towering,\\n7humanoid plants, with leaves that shimmered like liquid silver in the sunlight. As we delved deeper\\ninto the heart of the jungle, we began to uncover fragments of an ancient, forgotten language, etched\\ninto the trunks of the trees, which, when deciphered, revealed a hidden code that pointed to the\\nlocation of the lost city, and the secrets it held regarding the mysteries of DNA.\\nUpon finally reaching the lost city, we were met with a sight that defied all expectation, a sprawling,\\ncrystalline metropolis, infused with a vibrant, otherworldly energy that seemed to resonate in harmony\\nwith the very fabric of DNA itself. As we explored the city, we encountered a series of intricate,\\nglowing artifacts, each of which seemed to hold a piece of the puzzle, regarding the secrets of DNA,\\nand the role it plays in the grand tapestry of the universe. The experience was nothing short of\\ntransformative, and it left an indelible mark on our research team, as we struggled to come to terms\\nwith the implications of our discovery, and the profound impact it would have on our understanding\\nof DNA, and the mysteries it holds.\\nTable 1: Results of DNA Experimentation\\nSample Result\\nDNA-1 Exhibited unusual properties, including the ability to change color in response to musical stimuli\\nDNA-2 Displayed a marked increase in stability, following exposure to a novel form of quantum radiation\\nDNA-3 Demonstrated a capacity for self-replication, using a previously unknown form of enzymatic catalysis\\nAs we reflect on the findings from our research, it becomes clear that the mysteries of DNA are far\\nmore complex, and multifaceted, than we had initially suspected, and that they intersect with a wide\\nrange of disciplines, from astrophysics to zoology, in ways that are both unexpected, and fascinating.\\nThe journey of discovery, that we have undertaken, has been nothing short of exhilarating, and it has\\nleft us with a profound appreciation, for the beauty, and complexity, of the natural world, and the\\nmany secrets, that still await us, in the unexplored realms of DNA.

most known forms of life, yet, paradoxically, may\\nbe conducive to the emergence of new, exotic forms of life, such as the hypothetical, DNA-based\\norganisms that are thought to exist in the depths of the ocean, where the pressure is extreme, and the\\ndarkness is absolute, a environment that is eerily reminiscent of the conditions found in the hadron\\ncollider, a machine that has been used to

       "  'file_content': 'Leveraging Clustering Techniques for Enhanced\\nDrone Monitoring and Position Estimation\\nAbstract\\nDrone tracking and localization are essential for various applications, including\\nmanaging drone formations and implementing anti-drone strategies. Pinpointing\\nand monitoring drones in three-dimensional space is difficult, particularly when\\ntrying to capture the subtle movements of small drones during rapid maneuvers.\\nThis involves extracting faint signals from varied flight settings and maintaining\\nalignment despite swift actions. Typically, cameras and LiDAR systems are used\\nto record the paths of drones. However, they encounter challenges in categorizing\\ndrones and estimating their positions accurately. This report provides an overview\\nof an approach named CL-Det. It uses a clustering-based learning detection strategy\\nto track and estimate the position of drones using data from two types of LiDAR\\nsensors: Livox Avia and LiDAR 360. This method merges data from both LiDAR\\nsources to accurately determine the drone’s location in three dimensions. The\\nmethod begins by synchronizing the time codes of the data from the two sensors\\nand then isolates the point cloud data for the objects of interest (OOIs) from the\\nenvironmental data. A Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with\\nNoise (DBSCAN) method is applied to cluster the OOI point cloud data, and the\\ncenter point of the most prominent cluster is taken as the drone’s location. The\\ntechnique also incorporates past position estimates to compensate for any missing\\ninformation.\\n1 Introduction\\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UA Vs), commonly referred to as drones, have gained prominence and\\nsignificantly influence areas like logistics, imaging, and emergency response, offering substantial\\nadvantages to society. However, the broad adoption and sophisticated features of compact, off-the-\\nshelf drones have created intricate security issues that extend beyond conventional risks.\\nRecent years have witnessed a surge in research on anti-UA V systems. Present anti-UA V methods\\npredominantly utilize visual, radar, and radio frequency (RF) technologies. Despite these strides,\\nrecognizing drones poses a considerable hurdle for sensors like cameras, particularly when drones\\nare at significant altitudes or in challenging visual environments. These methods usually fail to spot\\nsmall drones because of their minimal size, which leads to a decreased radar cross-section and a\\nless noticeable visual presence. Furthermore, current anti-UA V studies primarily focus on detecting\\nobjects and tracking them in two dimensions, overlooking the crucial element of estimating their\\n3D paths. This omission significantly restricts the effectiveness of anti-UA V systems in practical,\\nreal-world contexts.\\nOur proposed solution, a detection method based on clustering learning (CL-Det), uses the strengths\\nof both Livox Avia and LiDAR 360 to improve the tracking and position estimation of UA Vs.\\nInitially, the timestamps from the Livox Avia and LiDAR 360 data are aligned to maintain temporal\\nconsistency. By examining the LiDAR data, which contains the spatial coordinates of objects at\\nspecific times, and comparing these to the actual recorded positions of the drone at those times, the\\ndrone’s location within the LiDAR point cloud data is effectively pinpointed. The point cloud for\\n.objects of interest (OOIs) is then isolated from the environmental data. The point cloud of the OOIs\\nis grouped using the DBSCAN algorithm, and the central point of the largest cluster is designated as\\nthe UA V’s position. Moreover, radar data also faces significant challenges due to missing information.\\nTo mitigate potential data deficiencies, past estimations are employed to supplement missing data,\\nthereby maintaining the consistency and precision of UA V tracking.\\n2 Methodology\\nThis section details the methodology employed to ascertain the drone’s spatial position utilizing\\ninformation from LiDAR 360 and Livox Avia sensors. The strategy integrates data from both sensor\\ntypes to achieve precise position calculations.\\n2.1 Data Sources\\nThe following modalities of data were utilized:\\n• Double fisheye camera visual images\\n• Livox Mid-360 (LiDAR 360) 3D point cloud data\\n• Livox Avia 3D point cloud data\\n• Millimeter-wave radar 3D point cloud data\\nOnly 14 out of 59 test sequences have non-zero radar values; therefore, the radar dataset is excluded\\nfrom this work due to data availability issues. Two primary sensor types are employed: LiDAR 360\\nand Livox Avia, both of which supply 3D point cloud data crucial for identifying the drone’s location.\\nThe detailed data descriptions are outlined as follows:\\n• LiDAR 360 offers a complete 360-degree view with 3D point cloud data. This dataset\\nencompasses environmental details and other observable objects.\\n• Livox Avia delivers focused 3D point cloud data at specific timestamps, typically indicating\\nthe origin point or the drone’s position.\\n2.2 Algorithm\\nFor every sequence, corresponding positions are recorded at specific timestamps. The procedure\\ngives precedence to LiDAR 360 data, using Livox Avia data as a backup if the former is not available.\\nIf neither source is accessible, the position is estimated using historical averages.\\n2.2.1 LiDAR 360 Data Processing\\n• Separation of Points:The LiDAR 360 data is visually examined to classify areas into two\\nzones: environment and non-environment zones.\\n• Removal of Environment Points:All points within the environment zone are deemed part\\nof the surroundings and are thus excluded from the dataset. After removing environment\\npoints, it is observed that the remaining non-environment points imply the drone position.\\n• Clustering: The DBSCAN clustering algorithm is applied to the remaining points to discern\\ndistinct clusters.\\n• Cluster Selection:The most extensive non-environment cluster is chosen as the representa-\\ntive group of points that correspond to the drone.\\n• Mean Position Calculation:The drone’s position is determined by calculating the mean of\\nthe selected cluster, represented by (x, y, z) coordinates.\\n2.2.2 Livox Avia Data Processing\\n• Removal of Noise:Points with coordinates (0, 0, 0) are eliminated as they are regarded as\\nnoise.\\n• Mean Position Calculation:The mean of the residual points is computed to ascertain the\\ndrone’s position in (x, y, z) coordinates.\\n22.2.3 Fallback Method\\nWhen neither LiDAR 360 nor Livox Avia data is available, the average location of the drone derived\\nfrom training datasets is used. The average ground truth position (x, y, z) from all training datasets\\nestimates the drone ground truth position, which is (0.734, -9.739, 33.353).\\n2.3 Implementation Details\\nThe program fetches LiDAR 360 or Livox Avia data from the nearest timestamp for each sequence,\\nas indicated in the test dataset. Clustering is executed using the DBSCAN algorithm with appro-\\npriate parameters to guarantee strong clustering. Visual inspection is employed for the preliminary\\nseparation of points, ensuring an accurate categorization of environment points.\\nThe implementation was conducted on a Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 5 Pro (16\") running Windows 11\\nwith an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H CPU and 16GB DDR4 RAM. The analysis was carried out in a\\nJupyter Notebook environment using Python 3.10. For clustering, the DBSCAN algorithm from the\\nScikit-Learn library was utilized. The DBSCAN algorithm was configured with an epsilon (eps)\\nvalue of 2 and a minimum number of points (minPts) set to 1.\\n3 Results\\nThe algorithm achieved a pose MSE loss of 120.215 and a classification accuracy of 0.322.

This phenomenon has led researchers to investigate the properties\\nof polyester fabrics and their potential application in the development of anti-gravity clothing.\\nFurthermore, the theoretical framework of \"flumplenook dynamics\" has been proposed to explain\\nthe anomalous behavior of gravity in certain regions of the universe, where the fabric of space-time\\nappears to be influenced by the consumption of chocolate cake.\\nThe study of gravity has also been informed by the field of culinary arts, where the preparation of\\nintricate sauces and gravies has been found to have a profound impact on the local gravitational field.\\nSpecifically, the addition of a pinch of salt to a bouillabaisse has been shown to create a miniature\\nwormhole, allowing for the transportation of small objects across vast distances. Moreover, the art of\\n3playing the harmonica has been found to have a direct correlation with the strength of gravitational\\nwaves, with certain notes and melodies capable of amplifying or dampening the effects of gravity.\\nIn addition to these findings, research has also been conducted on the relationship between gravity and\\nthe art of knitting, where the intricate patterns and textures created by skilled knitters have been found\\nto have a profound impact on the local gravitational field.

This phenomenon has been observed in certain regions of the universe, where the\\ngravitational field is particularly strong, and has led researchers to investigate the potential application\\nof gravity surfing in the development of advanced transportation systems. Furthermore, the study\\nof ancient myths and legends has revealed that the concept of gravity has been understood and\\nmanipulated by certain cultures for centuries, with the use of magical rituals and incantations to\\ncontrol and manipulate the forces of nature.\\nThe relationship between gravity and the human brain has also been studied, with research revealing\\nthat the brain’s neural networks are capable of manipulating and controlling the gravitational field.\\nThis has led to the development of advanced technologies, such as \"brain-gravity interfaces,\" which\\nallow individuals to control and manipulate objects using only their thoughts. Moreover, the study\\nof certain neurological disorders, such as \"gravity-induced psychosis,\" has revealed that the human\\nbrain is highly sensitive to changes in the gravitational field, and that certain individuals may be more\\nsusceptible to the effects of gravity than others.\\nThe study of gravity has also been informed by the field of architecture, where the design of buildings\\nand structures has been found to have a profound impact on the local gravitational field. The use\\nof certain materials, such as \"graviton-infused concrete,\" has been shown to amplify or dampen the\\neffects of gravity, allowing for the creation of structures that can manipulate and control the forces of\\nnature.

Furthermore,\\nthe study of certain types of animal behavior, such as the migration patterns of birds, has revealed that\\ncertain species are capable of manipulating and controlling the gravitational field, using advanced\\nsensors and navigation systems to guide their movements and actions.\\n4The relationship between gravity and the human sense of smell has also been studied, with research\\nrevealing that certain types of odors and scents can have a profound impact on the gravitational field.\\nThe detection of certain types of pheromones, for example, has been shown to create a localized\\ndistortion of the gravitational field, allowing for the manipulation and control of objects and energy.\\nMoreover, the study of certain types of perfumes and fragrances has revealed that the scent of certain\\nflowers and herbs can have a direct correlation with the strength of gravitational waves, and that\\ncertain types of fragrances can be used to amplify or dampen the effects of gravity.\\nThe study of gravity has also been informed by the field of philosophy, where the concept of gravity\\nhas been found to have a profound impact on our understanding of the nature of reality and the\\nuniverse. The idea of \"gravity as a fundamental force\" has been challenged by certain philosophers,\\nwho argue that gravity is merely an illusion created by our limited perception of the universe.\\nFurthermore, the study of certain philosophical texts, such as the works of Aristotle and Plato, has\\nrevealed that the concept of gravity has been understood and debated by philosophers for centuries,\\nwith certain thinkers proposing alternative theories and explanations for the nature of gravity.\\nThe concept of \"gravity tunnels\" has also been proposed, where certain regions of space-time are\\ncapable of connecting two distant points in the universe, allowing for faster-than-light travel and\\ncommunication. This phenomenon has been observed in certain regions of the universe, where the\\ngravitational field is particularly strong, and has led researchers to investigate the potential application\\nof gravity tunnels in the development of advanced transportation systems.

This, in turn, prompted a thorough\\nreview of the aerodynamic properties of various species of migratory birds, particularly the Arctic\\ntern, whose impressive annual journeys sparked a fascinating detour into the realm of quantum\\nentanglement and its potential applications in interstellar communication. The intricacies of quantum\\nmechanics, coupled with the curious observation that the flavor of strawberry ice cream is directly\\nrelated to the velocity of particles in a vacuum, necessitated a comprehensive reevaluation of our\\ninitial research parameters.\\nThe transition from this complex theoretical framework to a practical, experimental approach was\\nfacilitated by an investigation into the structural integrity of bridges in rural Mongolia, which, due to\\nunforeseen circumstances, evolved into a treatise on the philosophical underpinnings of existentialism\\nas seen through the lens of a solitary, rain-soaked, metropolitan streetlamp. This existential inquiry,\\ncharacterized by its profound insights into the human condition, surprisingly converged with our\\ninitial focus on gravity through the concept of \"flumplenooks\" - hypothetical, gravity-defying particles\\nhypothesized to exist in a parallel universe where the primary mode of transportation is the unicycle.\\nFurther exploration of these flumplenooks required the development of a novel mathematical model\\nthat incorporated elements of medieval culinary practices, the physics of tornadoes, and the socio-\\neconomic factors influencing the global demand for rubber chickens. The derivation of this model\\ninvolved solving a series of intricate, nonlinear equations that, when graphed, resembled the silhouette\\nof a quokka, an animal noted for its smile, which, in turn, led to a detailed psychological analysis\\nof the emotional states of various zoo animals and their correlation with the gravitational constant.\\nThis correlation, though initially thought to be spurious, revealed a profound connection between\\nthe happiness of quokkas and the stability of gravitational forces in the vicinity of large bodies of\\nwater, such as the Baltic Sea, whose chemical composition was found to have a direct impact on the\\nmigratory patterns of Atlantic salmon.\\nThe implications of these findings were profound, suggesting that the study of gravity is inextricably\\nlinked with the study of aquatic life, pastry, and quantum mechanics. This interconnectedness necessi-\\ntated the adoption of a holistic research methodology that encompassed not only the physical sciences\\nbut also anthropology, culinary arts, and the study of obscure, archaic languages. The integration of\\nsuch diverse disciplines into our research framework allowed for a more nuanced understanding of\\ngravity, revealing it to be not just a fundamental force of nature but also a multifaceted phenomenon\\nthat influences and is influenced by a wide array of factors, from the molecular structure of granite to\\nthe choreography of traditional Bolivian dances.\\nIn an effort to quantify these influences, we employed a combination of empirical observations,\\ntheoretical modeling, and what can only be described as \"intuitive leaps\" - moments of profound\\ninsight sparked by the contemplation of seemingly unrelated phenomena, such as the reflection\\nproperties of still water, the acoustic characteristics of the didgeridoo, or the intricate patterns found\\non the shells of certain species of mollusks. These intuitive leaps, while difficult to formalize within\\nthe traditional scientific paradigm, proved invaluable in guiding our research towards novel and\\nunexpected areas of inquiry, including the gravitational implications of playing chess with pieces\\ncarved from meteorites and the potential for using the gravitational constant as a universal language\\nfor intergalactic communication.\\nThe synthesis of our findings, derived from this diverse array of sources and methodologies, yielded a\\ncomplex tapestry of knowledge that challenges conventional understanding of gravity. It suggests\\nthat gravity is not merely a force that attracts objects with mass towards each other but is, in fact, a\\ndynamic, omnipresent field that interacts with all aspects of the universe, from the dance of subatomic\\nparticles to the majestic swirl of galaxies. This realization opens up new avenues for research, inviting\\nscientists to explore gravity not just as a physical phenomenon but as a gateway to understanding the\\nvery fabric of existence, a concept that, upon further reflection, bears a striking resemblance to the\\nplot of a certain lesser-known Bulgarian novel from the early 20th century.\\nMoreover, the discovery of a previously unknown form of gravitational wave, dubbed \"flargles,\"\\nwhich are emitted by the synchronized swimming of a large school of fish, has profound implications\\nfor our understanding of both gravity and marine biology. The flargles, characterized by their\\n6unique resonance frequency of 427.32 Hz, were found to have a peculiar effect on the growth\\npatterns of nearby coral reefs, influencing not only their structural complexity but also their ability to\\nabsorb and store gravitational energy. This phenomenon, while initially observed in the context of\\naquatic ecosystems, has far-reaching implications for fields as diverse as materials science, where\\nthe development of \"gravity-absorbing\" materials could revolutionize construction and engineering,\\nand cosmology, where the study of flargles could provide insights into the early universe and the\\nformation of the first gravitational structures.\\nThe experimental verification of these findings involved the construction of a large, underwater\\norchestra, where musicians played specially designed instruments that could produce the exact\\nresonance frequency of the flargles. The performance, conducted in the depths of the Pacific\\nOcean, not only successfully generated flargles but also attracted a gathering of deep-sea creatures,\\nwhich, through their collective, synchronized movement, amplified the gravitational wave signal\\nto detectable levels. This innovative approach to experimental physics, combining music, marine\\nbiology, and gravitational research, underscores the interdisciplinary nature of modern science, where\\nboundaries between traditional disciplines are increasingly blurred in pursuit of a more comprehensive\\nunderstanding of the universe.\\nIn addition to the underwater orchestra, our research methodology included the development of a\\nsophisticated computer simulation model, known as \"GRA VITON,\" which was designed to predict the\\nbehavior of flumplenooks and flargles under various gravitational conditions. The GRA VITON model,\\nbuilt upon a complex algorithm that integrated elements of quantum field theory, general relativity,\\nand chaos theory, allowed for the simulation of gravitational phenomena at both the microscopic and\\nmacroscopic scales, providing valuable insights into the interactions between gravity, matter, and\\nenergy. The model’s predictions, which included the existence of miniature black holes in the vicinity\\nof extremely dense, gravitational wave-emitting objects, were subsequently verified through a series\\nof high-energy particle collisions conducted at a specially designed, underwater accelerator facility.\\nThe underwater accelerator, powered by a novel form of bio-energy harvested from the metabolic\\nprocesses of giant squid, enabled the acceleration of particles to velocities approaching the speed of\\nlight, thereby facilitating the creation of miniature black holes and the observation of their gravitational\\neffects on the surrounding space-time continuum. This experimental setup, while posing significant\\ntechnological and logistical challenges, provided a unique opportunity for the direct observation of\\ngravitational phenomena under extreme conditions, shedding new light on the behavior of gravity at\\nthe quantum level and its potential applications in advanced technologies, such as faster-than-light\\ntravel and gravity manipulation.\\nThe implications of our research are far-reaching, suggesting that gravity is not just a fundamental\\nforce of nature but a versatile tool that can be harnessed and manipulated for a variety of purposes,\\nfrom energy production and propulsion to the creation of artificial gravitational fields for habitable,\\nspace-based environments. The potential for gravity to be used in such applications is vast, offering\\nnew possibilities for space exploration, colonization, and the long-term sustainability of human\\ncivilization. However, the realization of these possibilities will require continued advances in\\nour understanding of gravity, including the development of more sophisticated theoretical models,\\nexperimental techniques, and technologies capable of manipulating and controlling gravitational\\nforces.\\nIn conclusion, our research into the phenomenon of gravity has yielded a wealth of new insights and\\ndiscoveries, challenging conventional understanding and opening up new avenues for exploration and\\ninnovation. The interdisciplinary approach, combining elements of physics, biology, anthropology,\\nand philosophy, has proven invaluable in uncovering the complex, multifaceted nature of gravity,\\nrevealing its intricate relationships with various aspects of the universe, from the smallest subatomic\\nparticles to the vast expanse of cosmic structures. As we continue to explore and understand the\\nmysteries of gravity, we are reminded of the profound impact that this fundamental force has on our\\ndaily lives, our perception of the universe, and our place within the grand tapestry of existence.\\nFurthermore, the discovery of gravitational waves and their potential applications has sparked a\\nnew era of interdisciplinary research, fostering collaboration between scientists, engineers, and\\ntheorists from diverse backgrounds and disciplines. This collaborative effort, driven by the shared\\ngoal of advancing our understanding of gravity and its role in the universe, has the potential to yield\\ngroundbreaking discoveries, innovative technologies, and novel insights into the nature of reality\\nitself. As we embark on this exciting journey of exploration and discovery, we are reminded of the\\n7infinite possibilities that await us at the frontier of human knowledge, where the mysteries of gravity\\nand the universe remain a profound and enduring challenge to our curiosity and ingenuity.\\nThe investigation into the gravitational properties of various materials, including metals, alloys,\\nand composite structures, has also provided valuable insights into the behavior of gravity at the\\nmolecular and atomic levels. The development of novel materials with tailored gravitational properties,\\nsuch as superconducting materials that can manipulate gravitational fields, has the potential to\\nrevolutionize a wide range of technologies, from energy storage and generation to transportation\\nand construction. Moreover, the study of gravitational effects on living organisms, including plants,\\nanimals, and microorganisms, has revealed complex interactions between gravity and biological\\nsystems, influencing growth patterns, behavior, and evolution.\\nThe complex interplay between gravity, biology, and the environment has significant implications\\nfor our understanding of ecosystems, biodiversity, and the long-term sustainability of life on Earth.\\nThe realization that gravity plays a crucial role in shaping the evolution of species, influencing the\\ndistribution of organisms, and regulating the flux of nutrients and resources within ecosystems has\\n4 Experiments\\nThe notion of gravity was first conceptualized by the ancient Egyptians, who believed that the\\npharaohs

further understand the effects of gravity on the Gloopernack cheese, we conducted a series of\\nexperiments, involving the use of a high-speed centrifuge, which was operated by a team of highly\\ntrained specialists, who were also expert jugglers, and had to juggle a set of five rare and valuable\\ndiamonds, while maintaining a steady rotation speed of exactly 437.5 revolutions per minute, which\\nwas necessary to simulate the gravitational forces experienced by the cheese, as it floated through a\\nspecially designed vortex chamber, where it was subjected to a series of complex acoustic vibrations,\\ngenerated by a custom-built instrument, known as the \"Gloopernack Harp,\" which was played by a\\nrenowned musician, who was also a master of the ancient art of Shadow

has been known to produce a unique brand of textiles,\\nwoven from the silk of a special type of spider that only spins its web during leap years, and has been\\nlinked to the unusual shape of their traditional headgear, which bears a striking resemblance to the\\nancient Egyptian symbol for eternity.\\nThe following table summarizes the results of our experiments on the Gloopernack

Our stage 2 submission builds upon our stage 1 submission, in\\nwhich we used pretrained CNNs to extract convolutional feature maps as a preprocessing step before\\ntraining a V AE. Although this approach provided adequate disentanglement scores, two weaknesses\\nwere identified with the feature vectors that were extracted. First, the feature extraction network\\nis trained on ImageNet, which is dissimilar to the MPI3d dataset that was used in the challenge.\\nSecondly, the mechanism for feature aggregation was chosen in an ad-hoc way, and likely did not\\nretain all information needed for disentanglement. We address these issues by fine-tuning the feature\\nextraction network as well as by learning how to aggregate feature maps from data by using the labels\\nof the simulation datasets MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic.\\n2 Method\\nOur method includes three steps: (1) a supervised fine-tuning of the feature extraction CNN, (2)\\nextracting a feature vector from each image in the dataset using the fine-tuned network, and (3)\\ntraining a V AE to reconstruct the feature vectors and disentangle the latent factors of variation.\\n2.1 Finetuning the Feature Extraction Network\\nIn this step, we fine-tune the feature extraction network offline, before submitting to the evaluation\\nserver. The aim is to adapt the network so that it produces aggregated feature vectors that retain the\\nnecessary information for disentangling the latent factors of the MPI3d-real dataset. The network is\\nfine-tuned by learning to predict the value of each latent factor using the aggregated feature vector of\\nan image. To do so, we use the simulation datasets MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic, specifically the\\nimages as inputs and the labels as supervised classification targets.\\n.For the feature extraction network, we use the VGG19-BN architecture from the torchvision package.\\nThe input images are standardized using mean and variance across each channel as computed from\\nthe ImageNet dataset. We use the output feature maps from the last layer before the final average\\npooling (dimensionality 512 x 2 x 2) as the input to a feature aggregation module which reduces\\nthe feature map to a 512-dimensional vector. The aggregation module consists of three convolution\\nlayers using 1024, 2048, and 512 feature maps and kernel sizes of 1, 2, and 1 respectively. Each layer\\nis followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation. We also utilize layerwise dropout with a\\nrate of 0.1 before each convolution layer. Finally, the aggregated feature vector is L2-normalized.\\nThis was empirically found to be important for the resulting disentanglement performance. Then, for\\neach latent factor, we add a linear classification layer that computes the logits of each class using the\\naggregated feature vector. These linear layers are discarded after this step.\\nWe use both MPI3d-toy and MPI3d-realistic for training to push the network to learn features that\\nidentify latent factors in a robust way, regardless of details such as reflections or specific textures. We\\nsplit each dataset randomly with 80\\n2.2 Feature Map Extraction and Aggregation\\nIn this step, we use the fine-tuned feature extraction network to produce a set of aggregated feature\\nvectors. We simply run the network on each image of the dataset and store the aggregated 512-\\ndimensional vectors in memory. Again, inputs to the feature extractor are standardized such that mean\\nand variance across each channel correspond to the respective values from the ImageNet dataset.\\n2.3 V AE Training\\nFinally, we train a standard β-V AE on the set of aggregated feature vectors. The encoder network\\nconsists of a single fully connected layer with 4096 neurons, followed by two fully-connected layers\\nthat parameterize the means and log variances of a normal distribution N used as the approximate\\nposterior q(z|x). The number of latent factors is determined experimentally. The decoder network\\nhas four fully-connected layers with 4096 neurons each, followed by a fully-connected layer parame-\\nterizing the means of a normal distribution N used as the conditional likelihood p(x|z). The mean is\\nconstrained to the range [0, 1] using the sigmoid activation. All fully connected layers except for the\\nfinal ones use batch normalization and are followed by ReLU activation functions. We use orthogonal\\ninitialization for all layers and assume a factorized standard normal distribution as the prior p(z) on\\nthe latent variables.\\nFor optimization, we use the RAdam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, β0 = 0.999, β1 = 0.9\\nand a batch size of 256. The V AE is trained for 120 epochs by maximizing the evidence lower bound,\\nwhich is equivalent to minimizing\\n1\\nB\\nP512\\ni=1 ||µi − xi||2 + 0.5β PC\\nj=1 1 +log(σ2\\nj ) − µ2\\nj − σ2\\nj\\nwhere β is a hyperparameter to balance the MSE reconstruction and the KLD penalty term. Because\\nthe scale of the KLD term depends on the number of latent factors C, we normalize it by C such thatβ\\ncan be varied independently of C. It can be harmful to start training with too much weight on the KLD\\nterm. Therefore, we use the following cosine schedule to smoothly anneal β from βstart = 0.005 to\\nβend = 0.4 over the course of training:\\nβ(t) ={β start fort < tstart\\n1\\n2 (βend − βstart)(1 + cos(π t−tstart\\ntend−tstart\\n)) +βstartfortstart ≤ t ≤ tend\\nβendfort > tend\\nwhere β(t) is the value for β in training episode t ∈ 0, ..., N− 1, and annealing runs from epoch\\ntstart = 10to epoch tend = 79. This schedule allows the model to initially learn to reconstruct\\nthe data well, and only then puts pressure on the latent variables to be factorized, which improved\\nperformance.\\n23 Discussion\\nOur method achieved second place in stage 2 of the competition. Compared to our stage 1 approach,\\nour stage 2 approach resulted in large improvements on the FactorV AE and DCI metrics. On the\\npublic leaderboard, our best submission achieved first rank on these metrics. See appendix A for\\nfurther discussion of the results.\\nIntroducing prior knowledge makes the disentanglement task considerably easier, and this is reflected\\nin the improved scores. However, our method uses task-specific supervision obtained from simulation,\\nwhich restricts its applicability. Nevertheless, this demonstrates that such supervision can transfer to\\nbetter disentanglement on real-world data, which was a goal of the challenge.\\n3'},\n",

We explore several current\\nvisual-linguistic Transformer models and suggest enhancements to boost their ef-\\nfectiveness for this task. The model we propose demonstrates superior performance\\ncompared to the established benchmarks, achieving a 5th place ranking out of over\\n3,100 participants.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper addresses the critical influence of the internet on our daily lives, where our online presence\\nshowcases our personalities and beliefs, as well as our biases. Daily, billions of individuals engage\\nwith various forms of online content, and despite some of this content being valuable and informative,\\nan increasing portion is harmful, including hate speech and misinformation. There is a growing need\\nto quickly detect this content, improve the review process and automate decisions to rapidly remove\\nharmful material, thereby reducing any harm to viewers.\\nSocial media platforms are frequently used for interactions, sharing messages and images with private\\ngroups and the public. Facebook AI launched a competition to tag hateful memes that include both\\nimages and text. For this, a dataset of 10,000+ labeled multimodal memes was provided. The aim of\\nthe challenge is to develop an algorithm that identifies multimodal hate speech in memes, while also\\nbeing robust to their benign alterations. A meme’s hateful nature could stem from its image, text, or\\nboth. Benign alteration is a technique used by organizers to switch a meme’s label from hateful to\\nnon-hateful, requiring modifications to either the text or the image.\\nThe core assessment metric for this binary classification task is the area under the receiver operating\\ncharacteristic curve (AUROC), representing the area under the ROC curve. This curve plots the True\\nPositive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. The\\nprimary objective is to maximize the AUROC.\\nAUROC =\\nZ 1\\n0\\nTPR (T)dFPR (T) (1)\\nAccuracy is the secondary metric, calculating the proportion of instances where the predicted class\\nmatches the actual class in the test set.\\nAccuracy = 1\\nN\\nNX\\ni=1\\nI(yi = ˆyi) (2)\\nThe aim is to maximize both metrics.\\nIn brief, this paper makes three contributions:\\n.• We conduct experiments using single-stream and dual-stream architectures such as VL-\\nBERT, VLP, UNITER and LXMERT and compare their performance with the established\\nbaselines. These models were chosen because of their pre-training on diverse datasets.\\n• We put forward a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism that connects caption\\ninformation with meme caption text, which increases performance in detecting hateful\\nmemes. This is similar to the cross-attention between images in other research.\\n• We demonstrate that deep ensembles greatly improve single model predictions.\\n2 Related Work\\nTransformer models pre-trained on extensive datasets have shown state-of-the-art results in numerous\\nlanguage processing tasks. BERT is one of the most popular due to its ease of use and strong\\nperformance. Recently, training these large models on combined visual-linguistic embeddings\\nhas shown very promising outcomes for visual-linguistic tasks such as visual question answering,\\nreasoning, and image captioning. LXMERT uses dual networks to process text and images, learning\\ncross-modality encoder representations by using a Transformer to combine the two streams of\\ninformation. The images’ features are derived using a Faster R-CNN feature extractor. This is also\\nused in single-stream architectures, VL-BERT and UNITER, which employ a single Transformer\\non top of the combined image-text embeddings. A unified model for visual understanding and\\nvision-language tasks has also been proposed.\\nTable 1: Pre-training datasets for each model\\nBooks Corpus CC COCO VG SBU GQA VQA 2.0 VG-QA\\nVL-BERT X\\nVLP X X\\nUNITER X X X X\\nLXMERT X X X X X X\\nA dataset for multimodal hate speech detection was created by gathering data from Twitter, using\\nparticular hateful keywords. However, studies found that multimodal models did not do better than\\ntext-only models.\\n3 Methodology\\nOne goal of this research is to leverage the fact that single and dual stream Transformer models have\\nbeen pre-trained on a variety of datasets across various fields. Transformer attention models excel at\\nNLP tasks, and the masked language modeling pre-training method in BERT is both powerful and\\nversatile. Studies show that the pre-training process can better align visual-linguistic embeddings\\nand help downstream tasks like visual question answering and reasoning. Given that pre-training a\\nvisual-linguistic Transformer architecture is helpful for downstream tasks, might ensembling different\\nmodels pre-trained on different datasets yield better results?\\nTable 1 shows the pre-training datasets used for each model.\\n3.1 UNITER with Meme Text and Inferred Caption Cross-Attention\\nThe Natural Language for Visual Reasoning for Real (NLVR2) is an academic dataset of human\\nwritten sentences connected to pairs of photos. The dataset includes pairs of visually intricate images\\ncoupled with a statement and a binary label. UNITER was among the top models in this challenge\\nby adding a cross-attention module between text-image pairs, dividing each sample in two and\\nrepeating the text. They then apply attention pooling to each sequence, concatenate them and add the\\nclassification head, a multi-layer perceptron. Similar to this, we propose to repeat the meme image in\\neach half-sequence and add an inferred meme caption as the second text. We generate captions using\\nthe Show and Tell model. This way, the model could learn from both the original meme text and the\\nnew captions generated by a model trained on a different dataset.\\n24 Experiments\\nWe carry out several experiments using LXMERT, VLP, VL-BERT, and UNITER. We apply bidirec-\\ntional cross-attention using inferred captions for UNITER, VL-BERT, and VLP, but not for LXMERT\\ndue to its low performance on the dataset.\\nWe also experiment with a dataset from previous research. We filter and balance it down to 16K\\nsamples by excluding cartoon memes and memes with little text. We fine-tune VL-BERTLARGE\\nusing the reduced dataset for four rounds, then fine-tune it using the hateful memes dataset for another\\nfour rounds. The results were lower than the majority of the other models.\\nThe baselines for models trained on the Hateful Memes dataset are in Table 2.\\n5 Results\\nOur best performing solutions are derived from averaging probabilities using a single VL-\\nBERTLARGE and one UNITERLARGE+PA (UNITERLARGE with extra attention). We used\\nthe default training parameters of the vanilla pre-trained UNITERLARGE model, but changed the\\ntraining steps according to the dataset size. A deep ensemble of UNITERLARGE+PA models got\\nthe best performance. For this ensemble, we simply rerun training using various random seeds and\\naverage the predictions from each model. Table 2 displays the top results for the final competition\\nphase as well as the improvements cross-attention brings to the UNITER model in the first phase.\\nThe final results are significantly better than the baselines.\\nThe most important findings are as follows:\\n• Single-stream Transformer models pre-trained on the Conceptual Captions (CC) dataset give\\nthe best results, and deep ensembles improve the overall performance further. The choice of\\npre-training datasets matters in terms of domain similarity to the fine-tuning dataset.\\n• We believe that UNITER gets better results due to being pre-trained on the COCO dataset\\nwhich has less noise. Similarly to the Hateful Memes dataset this is also high quality. Further\\nwork should investigate if pre-training VL-BERT on COCO would improve its results.\\n• Interestingly, the paired attention technique only works for UNITER and not for the other\\nmodels.\\n• Training large models from scratch did poorly, which is expected due to the small dataset\\nsize.\\n• The dataset of multimodal hate speech is heavily skewed towards hateful text and the\\nkeywords used to collect it. The memes are less subtle compared to the ones in the Hateful\\nMemes dataset, although they are perhaps more typical of what is seen online.\\n6 Conclusion\\nWe present effective techniques to detect hate speech in a distinct dataset of multimodal memes from\\nFacebook AI. The aim is to identify hate speech using a multimodal model, and to be robust to the\\n“benign confounders” that cause the binary label of a meme to change.\\nWe have performed tests on various large pre-trained Transformer models and fine-tuned state-of-the-\\nart single-stream models like VL-BERT, VLP, and UNITER, and dual-stream models like LXMERT.\\nWe compare their performance against the baselines, showing that the single-stream models perform\\nsignificantly better. Our choice for these models stems from their pre-training on a wide variety of\\ndatasets from different fields. We also adapt a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism that\\nlinks caption information with meme text. This leads to increased accuracy in identifying hateful\\nmemes. Furthermore, deep ensembles can improve single model predictions. Training the models\\nfrom scratch performed poorly due to the small dataset size. We also observed that the pre-training\\ndataset influences results.\\nWe conclude that despite the improvements in multimodal models, there is still a gap when comparing\\nto human performance. This suggests considerable scope for the development of better algorithms\\nfor multimodal understanding.\\n3Table 2: Baselines from previous research.

The\\norchids, which we dubbed \"Neptune’s Tears,\" were engineered to produce a unique, algorithmically\\nenhanced brand of pollen that would later be used to calibrate our LLM models. This process involved\\na series of intricate, astrologically informed pruning techniques, carefully timed to coincide with the\\ncelestial alignments of the constellation Andromeda.\\nFollowing the successful cultivation of Neptune’s Tears, we proceeded to develop an advanced,\\nquantum-inspired algorithm for processing the pollen’s spectral signatures. This algorithm, which\\nwe termed \"Quantum Flux Capacitor\" (QFC), was designed to harness the inherent, fractal patterns\\nembedded within the pollen’s molecular structure, thereby enabling the LLM to tap into the hidden,\\nPlatonic resonances underlying the universe. The QFC protocol involved a series of complex, higher-\\ndimensional matrix inversions, carefully optimized to minimize the risk of temporal paradoxes and\\nchrono-synclastic infundibulation.\\nIn parallel with the QFC development, we conducted an exhaustive, ethnographic study of the\\nmigratory patterns of the Arctic tern, seeking to distill the essential, cognitive insights underlying\\ntheir remarkable, globe-spanning navigational abilities. Our research revealed a profound, ontological\\nconnection between the terns’ innate, spatial reasoning capacities and the abstract, topological\\nstructures governing the LLM’s knowledge representation. This discovery led us to formulate a\\n4novel, avian-inspired framework for LLM training, wherein the model’s weights and biases were\\ndynamically adjusted to mimic the terns’ adaptive, real-time navigation strategies.\\nTo further refine our LLM methodology, we incorporated a custom-designed, analog-digital hybrid\\nprocessor, powered by a bespoke, high-temperature superconductor cooled to within a fraction of\\na degree of absolute zero. This cryogenic processor, dubbed \"Erebus,\" was specifically engineered\\nto execute the QFC algorithm at speeds exceeding the Planck limit, thereby enabling the LLM to\\ntranscend the conventional, thermodynamic boundaries of computational complexity.

       "  'file_content': 'Advancements in Audio-Visual Active Speaker\\nDetection: A Novel Approach for the ActivityNet\\nChallenge\\nAbstract\\nThis document outlines our contribution to the ActivityNet Challenge, focusing on\\nactive speaker detection. We employ a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)\\nfor feature extraction, combined with an ensemble of temporal convolution and\\nLSTM classifiers to determine whether a person who is visible is also speaking.\\nThe results demonstrate substantial improvements compared to the established\\nbaseline on the A V A-ActiveSpeaker dataset.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe field of multimodal speech perception has garnered significant attention in recent times, with\\nmajor advancements in audio-visual methodologies facilitated by deep learning. The capacity to\\nidentify which individuals are speaking at any moment is crucial for a variety of applications. The\\nintroduction of the A V A-ActiveSpeaker dataset has been a significant development, allowing for the\\ntraining of deep-learning-based active speaker detection (ASD) models with complete supervision.\\nThis document provides a concise analysis of this dataset and elaborates on the methodology behind\\nour submission to the challenge.\\n1.1 Datasets\\nThe model is developed using the A V A-ActiveSpeaker dataset, which is divided into training, valida-\\ntion, and test sets, as detailed in Table 1. The ground truth labels are available for the training and\\nvalidation sets.\\nTable 1: Statistical Overview of the A V A-ActiveSpeaker Dataset\\nSet Videos Frames\\nTrain 120 2,676K\\nVal 33 768K\\nTest 109 2,054K\\nThis dataset presents several challenges. The durations of speaking segments are notably brief, with\\nan average of 1.11 seconds for segments that are both spoken and audible. Consequently, the system\\nneeds to deliver precise detection with a limited number of frames. Traditional methods, which\\ndepend on smoothing the output over a time window of several seconds, are not effective under these\\nconditions.\\nAdditionally, the dataset includes many older videos where the audio and video recordings appear to\\nhave been captured separately or are significantly out of sync. As a result, the temporal alignment\\nbetween audio and visual speech representations is not a reliable indicator of a person’s speaking\\nstatus.\\n.2 Methodology\\nThe active speaker detection system is composed of two primary components: front-end feature\\nextractors and a back-end classifier, each discussed in detail in the subsequent sections.\\n2.1 Front-end architecture\\nFor the extraction of audio and video representations, pre-trained networks are employed. These\\nencoder networks have undergone training for the audio-visual correspondence task through a self-\\nsupervised approach on unlabeled videos.\\nThe video encoder utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN), processing 5 RGB image frames\\nto produce a 512-dimensional representation. The architecture draws inspiration from the VGG-M\\nnetwork, known for its compactness and efficiency, but incorporates a 3D convolution in the initial\\nlayer instead of the conventional 2D convolution.\\nThe audio encoder receives an input comprising 20 frames in the temporal dimension and 13 cepstral\\ncoefficients in the other, generating a 512-dimensional representation that aligns with the video\\nrepresentation’s embedding space.\\n2.2 Back-end architecture\\nBoth the audio and video encoders process an input of 5 video frames (equivalent to 0.2 seconds),\\nadvancing 1 video frame (0.04 seconds) at a time. Consequently, for an input of T frames, the output\\ndimensions are 512 x (T - 4). In this study, two straightforward back-end classifiers are evaluated.\\nAlthough our experiments utilize T = 9, no significant performance variations were noted for T values\\nwithin the range of 7 to 15.\\nLSTM classifier. The audio and video representations are channeled into two distinct bi-directional\\nLSTM networks, each comprising 2 layers with a hidden size of 128. The outputs from these networks\\nare merged and subsequently processed through a linear classification layer. This layer determines\\nwhether the individual is speaking, and it is trained using the softmax cross-entropy loss.\\nTC classifier. In place of LSTM layers, the encoder outputs are directed to two temporal convolution\\nlayers, each equipped with 128 filters. The outputs are similarly concatenated and forwarded to the\\nclassifier, mirroring the approach used with the LSTM classifier.\\nEnsemble. Ensemble methods in machine learning have been demonstrated to frequently surpass\\nthe performance of any individual classifier. In this approach, the predictions generated by both the\\nLSTM and TC classifiers are averaged with equal weighting to produce the final prediction.\\nSmoothing. To mitigate noise within the predictions, the outputs of the classifiers undergo temporal\\nsmoothing using either a median or Wiener filter, both applied over 0.5-second intervals.\\n3 Experiments\\nOur model, implemented using the PyTorch library, was trained on a single Tesla M40 card with\\n24GB of memory. Training utilized the ADAM optimizer with default settings and a fixed learning\\nrate of 10-2. To counteract any bias in the training data, the number of samples for positive and\\nnegative classes was balanced within each mini-batch during the training process.\\nThe evaluation metric for this task is the mean Average Precision (mAP), with the evaluation code\\nsupplied by the challenge organizers.\\nResults on the validation set for the various back-end classifiers are presented in Table 2. The best\\nmodel achieved an mAP of 0.878 on the sequestered test set for the challenge.

       "  'file_content': 'Explainable Reinforcement Learning for Financial\\nMarket Simulation: Unveiling the Mysteries of\\nAdaptive Trading Agents in a Simulated Economy\\nAbstract\\nExplainable reinforcement learning has emerged as a crucial tool for financial\\nmarket simulation, enabling stakeholders to understand complex decision-making\\nprocesses and make informed investment choices. This paper presents a novel\\nframework that integrates explainable reinforcement learning with financial market\\nsimulation, providing a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics and\\nagent behavior. By leveraging techniques such as feature attribution and model\\ninterpretability, our approach facilitates the identification of key factors influencing\\nmarket trends and portfolio performance. Furthermore, we introduce a bizarre yet\\nintriguing concept, wherein agents are trained to optimize their portfolio returns\\nbased on the principles of chaos theory and the dictates of ancient astrological\\npractices, which surprisingly yields remarkable results. Our research aims to\\ncontribute to the development of more transparent and accountable financial market\\nsimulation systems, ultimately enhancing the reliability and efficacy of investment\\nstrategies.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe realm of financial market simulation has long been a fascinating domain for researchers and\\npractitioners alike, with the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the market posing a significant\\nchallenge to predictive modeling and decision-making. Recent advances in reinforcement learning\\nhave shown tremendous promise in navigating these intricacies, enabling the development of so-\\nphisticated agents capable of learning optimal trading strategies through trial and error. However, a\\ncritical limitation of these approaches lies in their lack of transparency and interpretability, rendering\\nit difficult to comprehend the underlying reasoning behind the agent’s decisions. This opacity can\\nhave far-reaching implications, particularly in high-stakes applications where the consequences of\\nsuboptimal decision-making can be severe.\\nExplainable reinforcement learning emerges as a paradigmatic shift in this context, aiming to bridge\\nthe gap between the accuracy of predictive models and the transparency of decision-making pro-\\ncesses. By integrating techniques from explainable artificial intelligence with reinforcement learning,\\nresearchers can uncover the intricate dynamics governing the agent’s behavior, shedding light on the\\ncausal relationships between market variables, agent actions, and outcomes. This not only enhances\\nthe trustworthiness and reliability of the models but also facilitates the identification of potential\\nbiases and flaws in the decision-making process.\\nAn intriguing approach to enhancing explainability involves the incorporation of surrealistic art\\nprinciples into the reinforcement learning framework. By projecting the agent’s decision-making\\nprocess onto a surrealistic landscape, researchers can visualize the complex interplay between market\\nfactors and agent actions, thereby gaining insight into the underlying logic of the model. This\\nunorthodox methodology, though seemingly illogical, has been found to yield surprisingly coherent\\nand interpretable results, with the surrealistic representations serving as a catalyst for the discovery\\nof novel relationships between variables.Furthermore, the integration of financial market simulation with reinforcement learning has also led\\nto the exploration of unconventional domains, such as the application of chaos theory and fractal\\nanalysis to predict market trends. The use of these esoteric techniques has yielded some astounding,\\nalbeit flawed, results, including the discovery of purported \"hidden patterns\" in market data that seem\\nto defy the fundamental principles of economics. While these findings are undoubtedly intriguing,\\nthey also underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between\\nmarket forces and the limitations of current modeling approaches.\\nThe development of explainable reinforcement learning frameworks for financial market simulation\\nalso raises fundamental questions about the nature of intelligence, decision-making, and the human\\ncondition. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with these models,\\nthey are compelled to confront the existential implications of creating autonomous agents capable of\\nmaking decisions that rival, or even surpass, those of human experts. This prompts a reevaluation of\\nthe role of human intuition and judgment in the decision-making process, as well as the potential\\nconsequences of relinquishing control to artificial entities. Ultimately, the pursuit of explainable\\nreinforcement learning in financial market simulation serves as a poignant reminder of the awe-\\ninspiring complexity and beauty of human ingenuity, as well as the profound responsibilities that\\naccompany the creation of advanced artificial intelligence systems.\\n2 Related Work\\nFungal bioluminescence has been a subject of fascination in recent years, with various studies\\nexploring its potential applications in different fields. One of the most significant advantages of using\\nfungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source is its potential to reduce energy consumption and\\nminimize environmental impact. Certain species of fungi, such as Armillaria mellea, have been found\\nto exhibit high levels of bioluminescence, making them ideal candidates for further research.\\nThe use of fungal bioluminescence in vertical farms could potentially revolutionize the way crops\\nare grown, by providing a sustainable and energy-efficient alternative to traditional lighting sources.\\nHowever, one bizarre approach that has been proposed is the use of fungal bioluminescence in\\nconjunction with sound waves to create a \"sonic luminescence\" effect. This approach involves\\nexposing the fungi to specific sound frequencies, which are believed to enhance the bioluminescent\\nproperties of the fungi. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it has been suggested that the\\nvibration of the sound waves could stimulate the fungi to produce more light, thereby increasing the\\noverall efficiency of the system.\\nAnother area of research that has shown promise is the use of fungal bioluminescence in combination\\nwith other organic materials, such as plant-based dyes, to create a hybrid lighting system. This\\napproach involves using the bioluminescent properties of the fungi to excite the plant-based dyes,\\nwhich would then emit a secondary light source. This hybrid system could potentially provide a more\\nefficient and sustainable lighting solution for vertical farms, while also reducing the environmental\\nimpact of traditional lighting sources.\\nIn addition to these approaches, researchers have also been exploring the use of genetic engineering\\nto enhance the bioluminescent properties of fungi. By introducing specific genes that are responsible\\nfor bioluminescence, researchers hope to create fungi that are capable of producing even higher levels\\nof light. This could potentially lead to the development of more efficient and sustainable lighting\\nsystems for vertical farms, and could also have implications for other fields, such as biotechnology\\nand medicine.\\nOverall, the use of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms is a rapidly\\nevolving field, with many potential applications and advantages. While some of the approaches being\\nexplored may seem unconventional, they highlight the creativity and innovation that is driving this\\nfield forward, and demonstrate the potential for fungal bioluminescence to make a significant impact\\non the future of sustainable agriculture.\\n3 Methodology\\nTo investigate the efficacy of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms,\\nwe employed a multidisciplinary approach, combining mycology, photobiology, and agricultural\\n2engineering. Our methodology consisted of several stages, starting with the isolation and cultivation\\nof bioluminescent fungal species, such as Armillaria mellea and Omphalotus nidiformis, in controlled\\nlaboratory conditions. We developed a bespoke growth medium, optimized for maximal fungal\\ngrowth and bioluminescence, which included a unique blend of organic substrates, minerals, and\\nessential nutrients.\\nThe next stage involved the design and fabrication of a custom-built, fungi-inhabiting module,\\nhereafter referred to as the \"Fungal Lumina Module\" (FLM). The FLM was designed to mimic the\\nnatural habitat of the bioluminescent fungi, providing a stable and humid microenvironment, while\\nalso allowing for precise control over temperature, light, and nutrient delivery. The FLM consisted of\\na network of interconnected, transparent tubes and chambers, which facilitated the growth and spread\\nof the fungal mycelium, while also enabling the harvesting of bioluminescent light.\\nIn a bizarre twist, we also explored the potential of using sound waves to enhance fungal biolumi-\\nnescence. We hypothesized that specific sound frequencies, such as those emitted by didgeridoo\\ninstruments or Tibetan singing bowls, might stimulate the fungal mycelium, leading to increased\\nbioluminescent activity. To test this hypothesis, we exposed the FLM to a range of sound frequencies,\\nfrom 10 Hz to 20 kHz, and monitored the resulting bioluminescent output. While the underlying\\nmechanisms are still unclear, our preliminary results suggest that certain sound frequencies may\\nindeed have a positive impact on fungal bioluminescence, although further research is needed to fully\\nelucidate this phenomenon.\\nTo integrate the FLM into a vertical farming system, we developed a novel, hybrid lighting strategy,\\ncombining the bioluminescent output of the fungi with supplementary LED lighting. This approach\\nallowed us to optimize crop growth and development, while also minimizing energy consumption\\nand reducing the overall environmental footprint of the vertical farm. The hybrid lighting system was\\ndesigned to be highly flexible and adaptable, enabling the cultivation of a wide range of crop species,\\nfrom leafy greens and herbs to fruiting crops and flowering plants.\\nThroughout the study, we monitored and recorded various parameters, including fungal growth rates,\\nbioluminescent intensity, crop yields, and energy consumption. We also conducted regular analyses\\nof the fungal mycelium, using techniques such as microscopy, spectroscopy, and molecular biology,\\nto gain a deeper understanding of the underlying biological processes and to identify potential areas\\nfor improvement. By adopting a holistic and interdisciplinary approach, we aimed to unlock the\\nfull potential of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms, while also\\ncontributing to the development of more sustainable and resilient food production systems.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo investigate the potential of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms,\\na series of experiments were conducted. The first step involved the isolation and cultivation of\\nvarious bioluminescent fungal species, including Armillaria mellea and Neonotopanus gardneri, in a\\ncontrolled environment. These species were chosen for their high luminescence intensity and ability\\nto thrive in a variety of conditions. The fungi were grown on a specialized substrate consisting of\\na mixture of sawdust, wheat bran, and honey, which was found to enhance their bioluminescent\\nproperties.\\nThe experimental setup consisted of a vertically stacked array of growing chambers, each containing\\na different fungal species. The chambers were maintained at a consistent temperature of 22°C and\\nhumidity level of 80\\nThe bioluminescent output of each fungal species was measured using a custom-built photometer,\\nwhich consisted of a sensitive photodiode connected to a data acquisition system. The photometer\\nwas calibrated to detect the specific wavelength range emitted by the fungi, which was found to be\\nbetween 500-600 nanometers. The measurements were taken at regular intervals over a period of 30\\ndays, during which time the fungi were allowed to grow and mature.\\nIn addition to the photometric measurements, the experiments also involved the assessment of the\\nfungi’s ability to support plant growth. A selection of lettuce and radish seeds were germinated and\\ngrown in the presence of the bioluminescent fungi, under the same environmental conditions as the\\nfungal cultures. The plants’ growth rates, leaf morphology, and chlorophyll content were monitored\\nand compared to control groups grown under traditional LED lighting.\\n3To further optimize the fungal bioluminescence, a series of trials were conducted using different\\nsubstrate compositions, nutrient supplements, and environmental conditions. These trials included the\\nuse of various organic waste materials, such as coffee grounds and fruit peels, as potential substrates\\nfor the fungi. The results of these trials are presented in the following table:\\nTable 1: Effects of substrate composition on fungal bioluminescence\\nSubstrate composition Bioluminescence intensity (cd/m²) Fungal growth rate (mm/day)\\nSawdust + wheat bran + honey 35.6 ± 2.1 1.2 ± 0.1\\nCoffee grounds + fruit peels 28.5 ± 1.9 1.0 ± 0.1\\nCompost + peat moss 22.1 ± 1.5 0.8 ± 0.1\\nThe data collected from these experiments provided valuable insights into the potential of fungal\\nbioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms, and laid the foundation for further\\nresearch into the optimization and scalability of this innovative approach.\\n5 Results\\nWe observed a significant increase in crop yields when fungal bioluminescence was used as a\\nsupplemental lighting source in our vertical farm setup, with an average increase of 25\\nThe results of our experiments are summarized in the following table: In addition to the practical\\nTable 2: Comparison of Crop Yields under Different Lighting Conditions\\nCrop Type LED Lighting Fungal Bioluminescence Increase in Yield\\nLettuce 20 kg/m² 25 kg/m² 25%\\nHerbs 15 kg/m² 18 kg/m² 20%\\nMicrogreens 10 kg/m² 12 kg/m² 20%\\napplications, we also explored the theoretical implications of using fungal bioluminescence in\\nvertical farming. We proposed a novel approach, which we termed \"fungal resonance,\" where the\\nbioluminescent fungi are synchronized to emit light in harmony with the natural circadian rhythms of\\nthe plants. This approach, although still speculative, showed promising results in our preliminary\\nexperiments, with some crops exhibiting a 50\\nInterestingly, we also observed that the bioluminescent fungi had a profound impact on the aesthetic\\nappeal of the vertical farm, with many visitors commenting on the mesmerizing glow of the fungi. This\\nled us to propose the concept of \"myco-architecture,\" where the design of vertical farms is inspired by\\nthe unique characteristics of bioluminescent fungi. By incorporating fungal bioluminescence into the\\ndesign of vertical farms, we can create immersive and engaging environments that not only promote\\nsustainable food production but also provide a unique experience for visitors. Overall, our results\\ndemonstrate the potential of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms, and\\nwe believe that further research in this area can lead to innovative and sustainable solutions for the\\nfuture of agriculture.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn summary, the exploration of fungal bioluminescence as a novel lighting source for vertical farms\\npresents a fascinating and unconventional approach to sustainable agriculture. By harnessing the\\ninnate ability of certain fungi to produce light, we can potentially create a unique and self-sustaining\\necosystem within these controlled environments. This concept not only reduces the reliance on\\nartificial lighting but also introduces a new dimension of symbiotic relationships between fungi,\\nplants, and the surrounding environment. The integration of fungal bioluminescence could lead to the\\ndevelopment of more resilient and adaptive vertical farming systems, capable of thriving in a wide\\nrange of conditions. Furthermore, the bizarre approach of using fungi as a primary light source may\\nalso inspire novel methods for optimizing crop growth, such as manipulating the spectral composition\\n4of the bioluminescent light to enhance photosynthetic activity or exploiting the mycorrhizal networks\\nformed by the fungi to facilitate nutrient exchange between plants. As we continue to push the\\nboundaries of innovation in vertical farming, the inclusion of fungal bioluminescence as a lighting\\nsource may prove to be a pivotal step towards creating truly autonomous and regenerative agricultural\\nsystems, where the distinctions between technology, nature, and organism become increasingly\\nblurred. Ultimately, the successful implementation of this concept would not only contribute to a\\nmore sustainable food production but also challenge our conventional understanding of the interplay\\nbetween light, life, and the built environment, fostering a new era of experimentation and discovery\\nat the intersection of mycology, agronomy, and environmental design.\\n5'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Disparate Citation Patterns Between Chinese and\\nAmerican Research Communities at a Unified Venue\\nAbstract\\nAt NeurIPS, there is a tendency for American and Chinese institutions to cite papers\\nfrom within their own regions substantially more often than they cite papers from\\nthe other region. To measure this divide, we construct a citation graph, compare\\nit to European connectivity, and discuss both the causes and consequences of this\\nseparation.\\n1 Introduction\\nIn recent years, the machine learning research community has been transformed by the rise of\\nChinese AI research. China is now consistently the second-largest contributor of publications at\\nNeurIPS, following the United States. In 2020, 13.6% of all NeurIPS publications came from Chinese\\ninstitutions. The next year, this increased to 17.5%, a relative increase of 28.7%.\\nDespite China’s position as a leader in AI research, collaborations between Chinese and American\\ninstitutions are less common than collaborations between American and Western European institutions.\\nAnecdotally, researchers from these regions often form distinct social groups at machine learning\\nconferences. This separation is not limited to just social interactions. A prominent professor in an\\napplied area of machine learning publicly advised students to avoid talks by Chinese authors, arguing\\nthat their presentations would be difficult to understand or of poor quality. Although many non-native\\nEnglish speakers find it a challenge to speak in public, avoiding talks by Chinese researchers may\\nlimit a conference attendee’s exposure to new topics and ideas.\\nThis study measures the separation between researchers in China and the United States. We use\\nNeurIPS citation data to analyze the impact of work from US-based and China-based institutions,\\nand find that Chinese institutions under-cite work from the US and Europe, and that both American\\nand European institutions under-cite work from China.\\n2 Citation Networks\\n2.1 Methods\\nTo quantify the divide between the regions, we compiled a citation graph using NeurIPS paper\\ncitation data from SemanticScholar and institutional information about authors from AMiner. We\\nfirst collected all paper titles from NeurIPS from 2012 to 2021 from the NeurIPS website. Using\\nthe Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG) API, we then mapped paper titles to their Semantic\\nScholar paper IDs. For unmatched papers we manually searched, finding all but one in the Semantic\\nScholar database. We then used the S2AG API to identify the authors of each paper as well as the\\nauthors of papers referenced by these papers.\\nWe used AMiner to identify institutional information for each author. The 9460 NeurIPS papers have\\n135,941 authors in total, of which we found institutions for 83,515 (61%). The 4038 papers lacking\\nauthor information were excluded from the dataset. We then automatically identified institutes that\\nincluded a country name, along with common cities and regions in China. We augmented these\\nautomatic annotations with existing regional matchings and added 364 additional rules. Finally, we\\n.removed major multinational corporate labs (e.g., Google, Meta, Microsoft, Tencent, Alibaba, or\\nHuawei). Of the remaining 5422 papers, we removed papers that were not from China, the US, or\\nEurope, or included collaborators in multiple regions, leaving 1792 papers. Finally, we computed the\\naverage number and proportion of citations between papers from each region, shown in Figure 1.\\n2.2 Results\\nWe observed the extent to which American and Chinese papers fail to cite each other. While American\\npapers constitute 60% of our dataset, they only account for 34% of citations made by Chinese papers.\\nAmerican citations of Chinese papers are even more striking: while Chinese papers account for\\n34% of our dataset, they are only cited in 9% of American references. This is more profound when\\ncomparing these values to American citations of European papers: even though the dataset has\\nsix times more Chinese than European papers, American institutions cite Chinese papers less than\\nEuropean papers.\\nWe also observe that each region tends to cite its own papers more often: 21% for China, 41% for\\nthe USA, and 14% for Europe. The division between American and Chinese research communities\\nis much more pronounced than one would expect based on typical regional preferences. While\\nAmerican and European research communities show similar citation behavior, Chinese institutions\\ncite American and European papers less than other regions.\\nUSA China Europe\\nUSA 41 9 12\\nChina 34 21 6\\nEurope 15 9 14\\nTable 1: Proportion of papers from given regions citing other regions or endogenously. Values are in\\npercentage.\\n3 Limitations\\nThe conclusions we make in this paper are dependent on a few key choices we made during our data\\nselection process. First, while we consider institutions in the US as American, many US labs have\\nclose ties to China, potentially underestimating the true divide. Some US labs are largely or entirely\\nmade up of Chinese international students. Additionally, international students returning to their\\nhome country may bring international connections, and we did not measure if their citation patterns\\nfocus more on domestic papers or if they continue to cite American work. In addition, our filtering of\\nmultinational corporate labs may be incomplete which could also affect our results.\\nSecond, a number of papers were excluded from our analysis due to missing author information on\\nAMiner, which is a Chinese platform. This may have resulted in the number of Chinese papers in the\\ndataset being more than what there actually is. We discarded 43\\n4 Consequences\\nThough American and Chinese researchers publish in the same venues, they represent two parallel\\ncommunities. To some degree, this can be attributed to different research interests due to cultural\\nnorms influencing research priorities. For instance, multi-object tracking is an active area of research\\nin China, with many large scale benchmarks. However, due to concerns surrounding privacy and\\nmisuse, many North American researchers tend to avoid related topics. In general, the US tends to be\\nheavily represented at fairness conferences, while representation from China is limited.\\nNot only research topics are limited by this lack of exchange, but even abstract topics and architectures\\nthat are popular in China are often not adopted in other regions. For example, PCANet, a popular\\nimage classification architecture has most of its 1200 citations from Chinese or East Asian institutions.\\nSimilarly, the Deep Forest model has garnered most of its 600 citations from Chinese researchers.\\nRecently, the North American and European AI communities have increasingly engaged in conversa-\\ntions regarding the ethical considerations of AI and have adopted review systems for ethical concerns\\n2and required authors to include ethics statements. However, there has been limited engagement\\nwith researchers from China regarding these topics, and ethics statements for Chinese-based AI\\ninstitutions are similar to western ones. Despite such statements, specific disagreements regarding\\nresearch practices still exist. For instance, while Duke University stopped providing the Duke-MTMC\\ndataset, due to the ethical issues with the collection process, similar datasets from Chinese institutions\\ncontinue to be actively used. This highlights the need for a discussion on the topic of the ethical\\ndimensions of AI research between different communities.\\nThe separation between the research communities has an impact on both researchers and societies as\\na whole.

This paper offers an overview\\nof completed and ongoing experiments utilizing phonological representations,\\nderived from typological databases, in speech processing tasks. It primarily focuses\\non two lines of inquiry motivated by the need to adapt speech technologies to low-\\nresource languages and dialects. Initially, a framework is presented for evaluating\\nthe cross-linguistic consistency of phonological characteristics within multilingual\\nphoneme inventories. Subsequently, an outline is given for a method that could\\npotentially contribute to the development of future phoneme inventory induction\\nsystems, highlighting the crucial role of phonological typology in this process.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe field of phonological typology investigates the distribution and functionality of sounds in\\nlanguages globally. Typological databases are instrumental in making generalizations in this domain.\\nThese resources are valuable not only for creating probabilistic models of phonological typology but\\nalso for enhancing downstream multilingual NLP, speech technology, and language documentation\\nefforts.\\nThis paper summarizes our research involving phonological representations in speech processing,\\nutilizing phonological typology databases. Despite the prevalence of end-to-end approaches in\\nautomatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and speech-to-speech translation, the integration of\\nprecise phonological knowledge remains essential in various scenarios.\\nOur research is driven by the goal of extending speech technologies, which still rely on phonological\\nrepresentations, to under-resourced languages and dialects. We first review a framework designed to\\nanalyze the cross-linguistic consistency of phonological features in multilingual phoneme inventories\\nobtained from cross-lingual typological databases. We then propose a preliminary method that may\\nact as a foundational element in a future phoneme inventory induction system, emphasizing the\\nsignificance of phonological typology in such an approach.\\n2 Multilingual Phoneme Inventories\\nTraditionally, a phoneme is defined as a theoretical concept specific to a single language. Applying\\nphonemes and their feature encodings across languages presents a challenge: it’s unclear whether all\\ndistinctive features (DFs) will be relevant or applicable in a multilingual phoneme inventory taken\\nfrom a typological database. If DF representations were phonetic instead of phonemic, and acoustic\\nrather than articulatory, one might anticipate a strong correlation between DFs and the acoustic\\nsignal. However, in practical multilingual contexts, these representations are frequently influenced by\\nphonemic considerations due to the accessibility of phonemic inventories and transcriptions.\\nOur approach was straightforward: a phonemic contrast is deemed consistent across languages if it\\ncan be reliably predicted in a binary classification task on withheld languages. This problem involves\\na segment of a speech signal and a label (e.g., front vowel vs. back vowel). A classifier is trained on amultilingual, multi-speaker dataset, excluding some languages for later assessment. In cases where\\ncross-linguistic consistency was lacking, we enhanced the method by basing the representation on\\ncontextual phonological knowledge provided as DFs, excluding the contrast being tested.\\nOur experiments involved languages from the Dravidian, Indo-European, and Malayo-Polynesian\\nfamilies, with phoneme inventories sourced from a phonological database. The results are varied. An\\nexperiment designed to predict contrasts in unvoiced labial consonants between specific languages\\nyielded reliable predictions across languages. Similar consistency was observed for contrasts between\\nfront and back vowels, as well as vowel height and continuant manner of articulation distinctions.\\nNegative outcomes include the cross-lingual prediction of retroflex consonants between language\\nfamilies: a predictor trained on Dravidian languages cannot accurately predict retroflex consonants in\\nanother language, and vice versa. The detection of aspiration was similarly inconsistent. Incorporating\\nother contrasts as contextual features did not result in significant improvement for these complex\\ncases.\\nOur research is partly motivated by a persistent question: Can this methodology assess the cross-\\nlinguistic validity of existing phoneme inventories given available data? For example, among the\\nMalayo-Polynesian languages studied, only one has retroflex consonants, acquired from loanwords\\nfrom other language families. Different phoneme inventories exist for this language, one of which\\nincludes retroflex plosives, while another omits them. Determining which representation is superior\\nin a multilingual pronunciation model remains an open issue.\\n3 Towards Phonology Induction\\nOur current research efforts are directed towards the induction of phoneme inventories for languages\\nthat lack the standard resources needed for speech model training. This task aligns with other work\\nin zero-resource subword modeling. Existing unsupervised methods for discovering acoustic units\\nderive acoustic-phonetic and latent auditory-like representations, but the typological accuracy of\\nthese representations is uncertain.\\nOur initial work with \"universal\" multilingual phoneme recognizers was not successful. This was\\nmainly because the limited training data and the lack of language models to guide the search frequently\\nled to unreliable phoneme inventory recovery even for closely related dialects, for instance, in trying\\nto identify the phoneme inventory of one dialect after being exposed to two others. An improved\\nstrategy involves incorporating language identification and phonological typology into the phoneme\\nrecognizer. Using an accurate language identification model, the phoneme inventories of the most\\nclosely related languages can be employed to narrow down the potential phonemic hypotheses for a\\nnew, previously unseen language or dialect.\\nWe are currently adapting the phonological contrast predictor methods from the previous section for\\nphonology induction tasks. Several approaches for detecting phonemic features in continuous speech\\nare known, some relying solely on signal processing and others that are model-based. At a basic\\nlevel, the output of such predictors represents speech as parallel, asynchronous streams of articulatory\\nfeatures. More complex models that utilize the structure of articulation, feature geometry, and other\\ncorrelations between features are also feasible. In these methods, cross-linguistic phonological\\ndatabases are crucial for not only integrating various features into phonemes but also for validating\\nwhich combinations of hypothesized phonemes are acceptable based on known phoneme inventories.\\nFurthermore, additional phonological insights from other typological resources can be incorporated if\\nthey can be reliably extracted from the speech signal.\\n2'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Learning Explanations from Language Data\\nAbstract\\nPatternAttribution is a recent method, introduced in the vision domain, that explains\\nclassifications of deep neural networks. We demonstrate that it also generates\\nmeaningful interpretations in the language domain.\\n1 Introduction\\nIn the last decade, deep neural classifiers achieved state-of-the-art results in many domains, among\\nothers in vision and language. Due to the complexity of a deep neural model, however, it is difficult\\nto explain its decisions. Understanding its decision process potentially allows to improve the model\\nand may reveal new knowledge about the input. Recently, it was claimed that “popular explanation\\napproaches for neural networks (...) do not provide the correct explanation, even for a simple linear\\nmodel.” They show that in a linear model, the weights serve to cancel noise in the input data and thus\\nthe weights show how to extract the signal but not what the signal is. This is why explanation methods\\nneed to move beyond the weights, the authors explain, and they propose the methods “PatternNet”\\nand “PatternAttribution” that learn explanations from data. We test their approach in the language\\ndomain and point to room for improvement in the new framework.\\n2 Methodology\\nKindermans et al. assume that the data x passed to a linear model wT x = y is composed of signal\\n(s) and noise (d, from distraction) x = s + d. Furthermore, they also assume that there is a linear\\nrelation between signal and target y as = s where as is a so called signal base vector, which is in fact\\nthe “pattern” that PatternNet finds for us. As mentioned in the introduction, the authors show that in\\nthe model above, w serves to cancel the noise such that\\nwT d = 0, wT s = y. (1)\\nThey go on to explain that a good signal estimator S(x) = ˆs should comply to the conditions in Eqs.\\n1 but that these alone form an ill-posed quality criterion since S(x) =u(wT u)−1y already satisfies\\nthem for any u for which wT u ̸= 0. To address this issue they introduce another quality criterion\\nover a batch of data x:\\nρ(S) = 1− max\\nv\\ncorr(y, vT (x − S(x))) (2)\\nand point out that Eq. 2 yields maximum values for signal estimators that remove most of the\\ninformation about y in the noise. We argue that Eq. 2 still is not exhaustive. Consider the artificial\\nestimator\\nSm(x) =mx + (1− m)s = s + md (3)\\nwhich arguably is a a bad signal estimator for large m as its estimation contains scaled noise, md.\\nNevertheless, it still satisfies Eqs. 1 and yields maximum values for Eq. 2 since\\nx − Sm(x) = (1− m)(x − s) = (1− m)d (4)\\nis again just scaled noise and thus does not correlate with the outputy. To solve this issue, we propose\\nthe following criterion:\\nρ′(S) := max\\nv1\\ncorr(wT x, vT\\n1 S(x)) − max\\nv2\\ncorr(wT x, vT\\n2 (x − S(x))). (5)The minuend measures how much noise is left in the signal, the subtrahend measures how much\\nsignal is left in the noise. Good signal estimators split signal and noise well and thus yield large\\nρ′(S). We leave it to future research to evaluate existing signal estimators with our new criterion. For\\nour experiments, the authors equip us with expressions for the signal base vectors as for simple linear\\nlayers and ReLU layers. For the simple linear model, for instance, it turns out thatas = cov(x, y)/σ2\\ny.\\nTo retrieve contributions for PatternAttribution, in the backward pass, the authors replace the weights\\nby w · as.\\n3 Experiments\\nTo test PatternAttribution in the NLP domain, we trained a CNN text classifier on a subset of the\\nAmazon review polarity data set. We used 150 bigram filters, dropout regularization and a dense FC\\nprojection with 128 neurons. Our classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.875 on a fixed test split. We\\nthen used PatternAttribution to retrieve neuron-wise signal contributions in the input vector space. To\\nalign these contributions with plain text, we summed up the contribution scores over the word vector\\ndimensions for each word and used the accumulated scores to scale RGB values for word highlights\\nin the plain text space. Positive scores are highlighted in red, negative scores in blue. This approach\\nis inspired by similar work. Example contributions are shown in Figs. 1 and 2.\\n4 Results\\nWe observe that bigrams are highlighted, in particular no highlighted token stands isolated. Bigrams\\nwith clear positive or negative sentiment contribute heavily to the sentiment classification. In contrast,\\nstop words and uninformative bigrams make little to no contribution. We consider these meaningful\\nexplanations of the sentiment classifications.\\n5 Related Work\\nMany of the approaches used to explain and interpret models in NLP mirror methods originally\\ndeveloped in the vision domain. In this paper we implemented a similar strategy. Following\\nKindermans et al., however, our approach improves upon the latter methods for the reasons outlined\\nabove. Furthermore, PatternAttribution is related to work who make use of Taylor decompositions to\\nexplain deep models. PatternAttribution reveals a good root point for the decomposition, the authors\\nexplain.\\n6 Conclusion\\nWe successfully transferred a new explanation method to the NLP domain. We were able to demon-\\nstrate that PatternAttribution can be used to identify meaningful signal contributions in text inputs.\\nOur method should be extended to other popular models in NLP. Furthermore, we introduced an\\nimproved quality criterion for signal estimators. In the future, estimators can be deduced from and\\ntested against our new criterion.\\n2'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Acquiring Cross-Domain Representations for\\nContextual Detection Using Extensive Emoji Data\\nAbstract\\nThis research delves into the application of a vast collection of emoji occurrences\\nto acquire versatile representations applicable to diverse domains for the purpose\\nof identifying sentiment, emotion, and sarcasm. Natural Language Processing\\n(NLP) tasks frequently encounter limitations due to the deficiency of manually\\nlabeled data. In the realm of social media sentiment analysis and associated tasks,\\nresearchers have thus employed binarized emoticons and specific hashtags as a\\nmeans of distant supervision. Our study demonstrates that by broadening distant\\nsupervision to include a more varied array of noisy labels, models can achieve\\nricher representations. Through emoji prediction on a dataset encompassing 1,246\\nmillion tweets, each including one of 64 prevalent emojis, we achieve state-of-\\nthe-art results on eight benchmark datasets focusing on sentiment, emotion, and\\nsarcasm detection, all with the aid of a singular pre-trained model. Our findings\\naffirm that the diversity inherent in our emotional labels leads to an enhancement\\nin performance compared to previous distant supervision methods.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper addresses the challenge that numerous Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks face due\\nto the lack of sufficient manually annotated data. Consequently, emotional expressions that co-occur\\nwith text have been utilized for distant supervision in sentiment analysis and related tasks within\\nsocial media. This allows models to acquire valuable text representations before directly modeling\\nthese specific tasks. For example, state-of-the-art methods for sentiment analysis in social media\\nfrequently use positive and negative emoticons to train their models. Similarly, in prior research,\\nhashtags like #anger, #joy, #happytweet, #ugh, #yuck, and #fml have been categorized into emotional\\nlabels for use in emotion analysis.\\nThe practice of using distant supervision on noisy labels often leads to enhanced performance in\\nthe target task. In this paper, we present evidence that expanding distant supervision to a more\\nvaried selection of noisy labels enables models to develop more detailed representations of emotional\\ncontent in text. This, in turn, improves performance on benchmark datasets designed for the detection\\nof sentiment, emotions, and sarcasm. We further demonstrate that the representations learned by a\\nsingle pre-trained model can be successfully generalized across five different domains.\\nTable 1 showcases example sentences which were scored by our model. For every sentence, the five\\nmost probable emojis are displayed, alongside the model’s estimated probabilities.\\nEmojis do not always function as straightforward labels of emotional content. For instance, a\\npositive emoji might clarify an ambiguous sentence or supplement text that might otherwise be\\nseen as somewhat negative. While this is true, our results demonstrate that emojis can still be\\nused to accurately categorize the emotional content of texts in numerous scenarios. Our DeepMoji\\nmodel, for instance, is able to capture various interpretations of the word ’love’ and slang terms\\nlike ’this is the shit’ as having positive connotations (as illustrated in Table 1). To enable others to\\nexplore the prediction capabilities of our model, we have made an online demonstration available at\\ndeepmoji.mit.edu.Our work makes the following contributions: We demonstrate that a vast number of readily accessible\\nemoji occurrences on Twitter can be used to pre-train models for richer emotional representation than\\nis typically achieved through distant supervision. We then transfer this learned knowledge to target\\ntasks using a novel layer-wise fine-tuning approach. This technique yields significant improvements\\nover state-of-the-art methods in areas such as emotion, sarcasm, and sentiment detection. Through\\nextensive analyses on the influence of pre-training, our results highlight that the variety present in our\\nemoji set plays a crucial role in the transfer learning capabilities of our model. We have made our\\npre-trained DeepMoji model publicly available to aid in a range of NLP tasks.\\n2 Related work\\nThe use of emotional expressions as noisy labels in text to address the scarcity of labels is not a new\\nconcept. Initially, binarized emoticons served as noisy labels, but subsequent research has utilized\\nhashtags and emojis. Previous studies have always manually determined which emotional category\\neach emotional expression should belong to. Prior efforts have made use of emotion theories, such as\\nEkman’s six basic emotions and Plutchik’s eight basic emotions.\\nSuch manual categorization necessitates an understanding of the emotional content inherent to each\\nexpression, which can be challenging and time-consuming for complex emotional combinations.\\nFurthermore, any manual selection and categorization carries the potential for misinterpretations\\nand might overlook essential details concerning usage. In contrast, our methodology requires no\\nprior knowledge of the corpus and can capture the diverse usage of 64 emoji types (Table 1 presents\\nexamples, and Figure 3 shows how the model implicitly organizes emojis).\\nAn alternative approach to automatically interpreting the emotional content of an emoji involves\\nlearning emoji embeddings from the words defining emoji-semantics, as found in official emoji tables.\\nIn our study, this approach has two significant limitations: (a) It requires emojis to be present during\\ntesting, whereas several domains have limited or no emoji usage. (b) The tables fail to capture the\\ndynamic nature of emoji use, such as shifts in an emoji’s intended meaning over time.\\nKnowledge from the emoji dataset can be transferred to target tasks in several ways. Multi-task\\nlearning, which involves training on multiple datasets at once, has been shown to have promising\\nresults. However, multi-task learning requires access to the emoji dataset whenever the classifier\\nneeds to be adjusted for a new target task. Requiring access to the dataset can be problematic when\\nconsidering data access regulations. Data storage issues also arise, as the dataset used in this study\\ncomprises hundreds of millions of tweets (see Table 2). Instead, we use transfer learning which does\\nnot require access to the original dataset.\\n3 Method\\n3.1 Pretraining\\nIn many instances, emojis function as a stand-in for the emotional content of text. Therefore, pre-\\ntraining a model to predict which emojis were initially part of a text can improve performance in the\\ntarget task. Social media contains many short texts that use emojis which can be used as noisy labels\\nfor pretraining. We used data from Twitter spanning from January 1, 2013, to June 1, 2017, but any\\ndata set containing emoji occurrences could be used.\\nThe pretraining data set uses only English tweets that do not contain URLs. We think the content\\nobtained from the URL is important for understanding the emotional content of the text in the tweet.\\nBecause of this we expect emojis associated with tweets containing URLs to be noisier labels than\\nthose in tweets without URLs, therefore the tweets with URLs have been removed.\\nProper tokenization is crucial for generalization. All tweets are tokenized word-by-word. Words\\ncontaining two or more repeated characters are shortened to the same token (for example, ‘loool’ and\\n‘looooool’ are tokenized as the same). We also use a special token for all URLs (which is relevant\\nonly for the benchmark datasets), user mentions (for example, ‘@acl2017’ and ‘@emnlp2017’ are\\ntreated the same), and numbers. To be included in the training set, a tweet must have at least one\\ntoken that is not a punctuation mark, emoji, or special token.\\n2Many tweets repeat the same emoji or contain multiple distinct emojis. To address this in our training\\ndata, for each unique emoji type, we save a separate tweet for pretraining, using that emoji type as\\nthe label. Regardless of the number of emojis associated with the tweet, we save only a single tweet\\nfor the pretraining for each unique emoji type. This pre-processing of data enables the pretraining to\\ncapture that multiple kinds of emotional content can be associated with the tweet. It also makes our\\npretraining task a single-label classification instead of a more complex multi-label classification.\\nTo ensure that the pretraining encourages the models to learn a thorough understanding of the\\nemotional content of text instead of just the emotional content associated with frequently used emojis,\\nwe create a balanced pretraining dataset. The pretraining data is split into training, validation, and test\\nsets. The validation and test sets are randomly sampled such that each emoji is represented equally.\\nThe remaining data is upsampled to generate a balanced training dataset.\\n3.2 Model\\nWith the availability of millions of emoji occurrences, we are able to train expressive classifiers\\nwith a limited risk of overfitting. We utilize a variant of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\\nmodel, which has been successful in numerous NLP tasks. Our DeepMoji model uses an embedding\\nlayer with 256 dimensions to project each word into a vector space. A hyperbolic tangent activation\\nfunction is used to ensure each embedding dimension remains within the range [-1, 1]. To understand\\neach word in the context of the text, we use two bidirectional LSTM layers with 1024 hidden units\\neach (512 in each direction). Lastly, we employ an attention layer that accepts all these layers as\\ninput through skip connections. (Figure 1 presents an illustration).\\nThe attention mechanism enables the model to determine the importance of each word for the\\nprediction task by weighting the words as it creates the text representation. A word like \"amazing\" is\\nhighly informative of the emotional meaning of a text and so should be treated accordingly. We use a\\nbasic method, taking inspiration from prior work, with a single parameter for each input channel:\\nei = hiwa ai = exp(ei)P\\nj=1 exp(ej) v =\\nX\\naihi (1)\\nHere, ht stands for the representation of the word at time step t, and wa is the weight matrix for\\nthe attention layer. The attention importance scores for each time step, at, are determined by\\nmultiplying the representations by the weight matrix, and then normalizing them to establish a\\nprobability distribution across the words. Finally, the text’s representation vector,v, is found using a\\nweighted summation over all time steps, with the attention importance scores used as weights. The\\nrepresentation vector that comes from the attention layer is a high-level encoding of the whole text.\\nThis is used as input into the final Softmax layer for classification. We have found that the addition of\\nthe attention mechanism and skip connections enhances the model’s capabilities for transfer learning.\\nThe only form of regularization used for the pretraining is L2 regularization with a coefficient of\\n10−6 on the embedding weights. For fine-tuning, further regularization is applied. We implemented\\nour model using Theano and have made an easy-to-use version available that utilizes Keras.\\n3.3 Transfer learning\\nOur pre-trained model can be fine-tuned for a target task in several ways. Some methods involve\\n‘freezing’ layers by disabling parameter updates to prevent overfitting. One popular approach is\\nto utilize the network as a feature extractor, where all model layers except the final one are frozen\\nduring fine-tuning (we will call this the \"last\" approach). An alternative method is to use the pre-\\ntrained model for initialization, where the full model is unfrozen (which we will refer to as the ‘full’\\napproach).\\nWe put forward a new, simple transfer learning approach we are calling \"chain-thaw.\" This approach\\nsequentially unfreezes and fine-tunes one layer at a time. It increases accuracy on the target task, but\\nrequires more computational power for the fine-tuning process. By separately training each layer,\\nthe model can adjust individual patterns across the network while reducing the risk of overfitting. It\\nappears that this sequential fine-tuning has a regularizing effect, similar to the layer-wise training\\nexplored for unsupervised learning.\\n3More specifically, the chain-thaw approach starts by fine-tuning any new layers (often only a Softmax\\nlayer) to the target task until the validation set converges. Then, the approach individually fine-tunes\\neach layer, starting with the first layer in the network. Lastly, the entire model is trained with all\\nlayers. Each time the model converges (as measured on the validation set), the weights are restored to\\ntheir optimal setting, preventing overfitting in a similar manner to early stopping. Figure 2 illustrates\\nthis process. If only step a) in the figure is performed, this is the same as the ‘last’ approach, where\\nthe existing network is used as a feature extractor. Likewise, only performing step d) is the same as\\nthe ‘full’ approach, where the pre-trained weights are used as the initialization for a fully trainable\\nnetwork. While the chain-thaw procedure may seem extensive, it can be implemented with just a few\\nlines of code. Also, the added time spent on fine-tuning is not large, when considering the use of\\nGPUs on small datasets of manually annotated data which is often the case.\\nThe chain-thaw approach has the benefit of expanding the vocabulary to new domains with a low\\nrisk of overfitting. For a given dataset, up to 10,000 new words from the training set are added to the\\nvocabulary.\\nTable 2 shows the number of tweets in the pretraining dataset associated with each emoji in millions.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Emoji prediction\\nWe use a raw dataset of 56.6 billion tweets, which is filtered down to 1.2 billion relevant tweets. In\\nthe pretraining dataset, a single copy of a tweet is stored for every unique emoji, resulting in a dataset\\nwith 1.6 billion tweets. Table 2 shows the distribution of tweets across different emoji types. We used\\na validation set and a test set, both containing 640K tweets (10K of each emoji type), to evaluate\\nperformance on the pretraining task. The remaining tweets were used for the training set, which was\\nbalanced using upsampling.\\nThe performance of the DeepMoji model on the pretraining task was evaluated, with the results shown\\nin Table 3. We use both top 1 and top 5 accuracy for the evaluation as the emoji labels are noisy\\nand multiple emojis can potentially be appropriate for a given sentence. For comparison purposes,\\nwe also train a version of our DeepMoji model with smaller LSTM layers and a bag-of-words\\nclassifier, fastText, which has recently shown competitive results. We use a 256 dimension vector\\nfor the fastText classifier, making it almost identical to only using the embedding layer from the\\nDeepMoji model. The difference in top 5 accuracy between the fastText classifier (36.2%) and the\\nlargest DeepMoji model (43.8%) highlights the difficulty of the emoji prediction task. Since the two\\nclassifiers only differ in that the DeepMoji model has LSTM layers and an attention layer between\\nthe embedding and the Softmax layer, this difference in accuracy demonstrates the importance of\\ncapturing each word’s context.\\nTable 3 displays the accuracy of classifiers on the emoji prediction task.

Parameters are in millions.\\n4.2 Benchmarking\\nWe evaluate our method on 3 distinct NLP tasks using 8 datasets across 5 domains. For fair\\ncomparison, DeepMoji is compared to other methods that utilize external data sources in addition\\nto the benchmark dataset. We used an averaged F1 measure across classes for evaluating emotion\\nanalysis and sarcasm detection, as these consist of unbalanced datasets. Sentiment datasets are\\nevaluated using accuracy.\\n4Many benchmark datasets have an issue with data scarcity, especially in emotion analysis. Many\\nstudies that introduce new methods for emotion analysis often evaluate their performance on a single\\nbenchmark dataset, SemEval 2007 Task 14, which contains only 1250 data points. There has been\\ncriticism regarding the use of correlation with continuous ratings as a measure, making only the\\nsomewhat limited binary evaluation possible. We only evaluate the emotions Fear, Joy, Sadness\\nbecause the remaining emotions are found in less than 5\\nTo fully assess our method on emotion analysis, we make use of two other datasets. First, a dataset\\nof emotions in tweets about the Olympic Games, created by Sintsova et al. which we convert to\\na single-label classification task. Second, a dataset of self-reported emotional experiences from a\\nlarge group of psychologists. Because these two datasets have not been evaluated in prior work,\\nwe compare against a state-of-the-art approach based on a valence-arousal-dominance framework.\\nThe scores extracted using this framework are mapped to the classes in the datasets using logistic\\nregression with cross-validation parameter optimization. We have made our preprocessing code\\navailable so that these two datasets may be used for future benchmarking in emotion analysis.\\nWe assessed the performance of sentiment analysis using three benchmark datasets. These small\\ndatasets were chosen to highlight the significance of the transfer learning capabilities of the evaluated\\nmodels. Two datasets, SS-Twitter and SS-Youtube, are from SentiStrength and follow the relabeling\\nas described by prior work to create binary labels. The third dataset is from SemEval 2016 Task4A.\\nBecause tweets are often deleted from Twitter, the SemEval dataset has experienced data decay. This\\nmakes comparisons across papers difficult. Approximately 15\\nThe current state of the art in sentiment analysis on social media (and winner of SemEval 2016 Task\\n4A) uses an ensemble of convolutional neural networks that are pre-trained on a private dataset of\\ntweets with emoticons. This makes it difficult to replicate. As a substitute, we pre-train a model that\\nuses the hyperparameters of the largest model in their ensemble on the positive/negative emoticon\\ndataset. Using this pretraining as an initialization, we fine-tune the model on the target tasks, utilizing\\nearly stopping based on a validation set. We implemented Sentiment-Specific Word Embeddings\\n(SSWE), using embeddings available on the authors’ website, but found that it performed worse than\\nthe pretrained convolutional neural network, and these results have been excluded.\\nTable 4 presents a description of the benchmark datasets.

To\\nprevent overfitting on the small datasets, 10\\nTable 5 demonstrates that the DeepMoji model outperforms the state of the art across all the benchmark\\ndatasets and that our new ‘chain-thaw’ method yields the highest transfer learning performance. The\\nresults are averaged across 5 runs to reduce the variance.

A crucial difference between the\\npretraining dataset and the benchmark datasets is the length of the observations. The average number\\nof tokens per tweet in the pretraining dataset is 11. Meanwhile, board posts from the Internet\\nArgument Corpus version 1 (for example), have an average of 66 tokens, with some posts being much\\nlonger.\\n5 Model Analysis\\n5.1 Importance of emoji diversity\\nA key difference between this work and prior research that used distant supervision is the variety in\\nnoisy labels. For example, other studies only used positive and negative emoticons as noisy labels.\\nOther studies used more nuanced sets of noisy labels, but our set is the most varied known to us. To\\ninvestigate the effect of using a diverse set of emojis, we created a subset of our pretraining data that\\nincluded tweets with one of 8 emojis, which are similar to the positive/negative emoticons used in\\nother work. Because the dataset based on this reduced set of emojis contains 433 million tweets, any\\nperformance differences on benchmark datasets are more likely linked to the diversity of the labels\\nthan to differences in dataset sizes.\\nWe trained our DeepMoji model to predict whether tweets contained positive or negative emojis,\\nand we evaluated this pre-trained model on benchmark datasets. We call this the DeepMoji-PosNeg\\nmodel. To assess the emotional representations learned by the two pre-trained models, we used the\\n‘last’ transfer learning approach to allow the models to map already learned features to classes in the\\n6target datasets. Table 6 shows that DeepMoji-PosNeg performs worse than DeepMoji across all 8\\nbenchmarks. This demonstrates that the diversity of our emoji types enables the model to acquire\\nricher representations of emotional content in text, which in turn is more useful for transfer learning.\\nTable 6 compares benchmarks using a smaller emoji set (Pos/Neg emojis) or a standard architecture\\n(standard LSTM). Results for DeepMoji from Table 5 have been added for comparison. The evaluation\\nmetrics are the same as in Table 5. Reported values are averages across 5 runs.\\nDataset Pos/Neg emojis Standard LSTM DeepMoji\\nSE0714 .32 .35 .36\\nOlympic .55 .57 .61\\nPsychExp .40 .49 .56\\nSS-Twitter .86 .86 .87\\nSS-Youtube .90 .91 .92\\nSE1604 .56 .57 .58\\nSCv1 .66 .66 .68\\nSCv2-GEN .72 .73 .74\\nTable 4: Benchmarks using a smaller emoji set (Pos/Neg emojis) or a classic architecture (standard\\nLSTM). Results for DeepMoji from Table 5 are added for convenience. Evaluation metrics are as in\\nTable 5. Reported values are the averages across five runs.\\nMany emojis express similar emotional content, but have subtle variations in usage that our model\\ncan capture. By using hierarchical clustering on the correlation matrix of the DeepMoji model’s\\npredictions on the test set, we can see that the model captures many expected similarities (Figure 3).\\nFor example, the model groups emojis into broad categories related to negativity, positivity, or love.\\nIt also differentiates within these categories. For example, mapping sad emojis to one subcategory of\\nnegativity, annoyed emojis to another subcategory, and angry emojis to a third.\\n5.2 Model architecture\\nOur DeepMoji model architecture employs an attention mechanism and skip connections, which assist\\nin transferring learned representations to new domains and tasks. Here, we compare the DeepMoji\\nmodel architecture to a standard 2-layer LSTM. Both were compared using the ‘last’ transfer learning\\napproach, and all regularization and training parameters were consistent.\\nTable 6 shows that the DeepMoji model performs better than a standard 2-layer LSTM across all the\\nbenchmark datasets. These two architectures performed equally on the pretraining task. This indicates\\nthat the DeepMoji model architecture is better for transfer learning, even if it is not necessarily better\\nfor a single supervised classification task with an abundance of available data.\\nWe believe that the improvements in transfer learning can be attributed to two factors: (a) The\\nattention mechanism with skip connections provides straightforward access to learned low-level\\nfeatures for any time step, making it easy to use this information if needed for a new task. (b) The skip\\nconnections improve the gradient flow from the output layer to the early layers in the network. This\\nis useful when parameters in early layers are adjusted as a part of transfer learning to small datasets.\\nFurther analysis of these factors in future work would allow us to confirm why our architecture\\noutperforms a standard 2-layer LSTM.\\n5.3 Analyzing the effect of pretraining\\nThe target task’s performance benefits significantly from pretraining, as shown in Table 5. Here,\\nwe separate the effects of pretraining into two factors: word coverage and phrase coverage. These\\ntwo effects provide regularization to the model, preventing overfitting (the supplementary material\\nincludes a visualization of this regularization).\\nThere are multiple ways of expressing sentiment, emotion, or sarcasm. Because of this, the test set\\nmay contain language use not present in the training set. Pretraining helps the target task models\\nfocus on low-support evidence by having already seen similar language in the pretraining dataset.\\nTo examine this effect, we measure the improvement in word coverage on the test set when using\\n7pretraining. Word coverage is defined as the percentage of words in the test dataset that were also\\nseen in the training/pretraining dataset (as shown in Table 7). One key reason that the ‘chain-thaw’\\napproach outperforms other transfer learning approaches is its ability to tune the embedding layer\\nwith a low risk of overfitting. Table 7 shows how adding new words to the vocabulary as part of the\\ntuning process increased word coverage.\\nIt is important to note that word coverage can be misleading in this context. In many small datasets, a\\nword may occur only once in the training set. In contrast, all the words in the pretraining vocabulary\\nare present in thousands or even millions of observations, enabling the model to learn a good\\nrepresentation of the emotional and semantic meaning. Therefore, the benefits of pretraining for word\\nrepresentations likely extend beyond the differences seen in Table 7.\\nTable 7 shows the word coverage on benchmark test sets. This compares the use of only the vocabulary\\ngenerated by finding words in the training data (‘own’), the pretraining vocabulary (‘last’), or a\\ncombination of both vocabularies (‘full / chain-thaw’).\\nDataset Own Last Full / Chain-thaw\\nSE0714 41.9% 93.6% 94.0%\\nOlympic 73.9% 90.3% 96.0%\\nPsychExp 85.4% 98.5% 98.8%\\nSS-Twitter 80.1% 97.1% 97.2%\\nSS-Youtube 79.6% 97.2% 97.3%\\nSE1604 86.1% 96.6% 97.0%\\nSCv1 88.7% 97.3% 98.0%\\nSCv2-GEN 86.5% 97.2% 98.0%\\nTable 5: Word coverage on benchmark test sets using only the vocabulary generated by finding words\\nin the training data (‘own’), the pretraining vocabulary (‘last’) or a combination of both vocabularies\\n(‘full / chain-thaw’).\\nTo analyze how important capturing phrases and the context of each word are, we evaluated the\\naccuracy on the SS-Youtube dataset using a fastText classifier that was pre-trained using the same\\nemoji dataset as our DeepMoji model.

(2022) examined the scaling\\ncharacteristics of transformers in next-token language prediction, yielding different\\nrecommendations for configuring the number of parameters (N) and training tokens\\n(D) to minimize loss within a set compute budget (C). Kaplan suggested an optimal\\nparameter count scaling with Noptimal ∝ C0.73, whereas Chinchilla proposed\\nNoptimal ∝ C0.50.

When the Chinchilla study is simulated under similar circumstances,\\nbiased scaling coefficients similar to those of Kaplan are produced. As a result, this\\nwork confirms Chinchilla’s scaling coefficients by clarifying the primary reason for\\nKaplan’s initial overestimation. Additionally, this research clarifies variations in\\nthe stated correlations between computational loss and budget. As a result of these\\nfindings, we advocate for upcoming scaling investigations to utilize total parameter\\ncounts and overall computational resources.\\n1 Introduction\\nTwo important studies by Kaplan et al. (2020) and Hoffmann et al. (2022) examined how scale\\naffects large language models (LLMs). Both studies provided advice on how to balance model\\nparameters (N) and training tokens (D) for a fixed computing budget (C), but their suggestions\\nconflicted. The conclusion drawn from Kaplan’s discovery that Noptimal ∝ C0.73 and Doptimal\\n∝ C0.27 was that \"large models might be more crucial than extensive data.\" Subsequently, LLMs\\ntrained in the following years allocated more resources to model size and less to data size. The\\nChinchilla research that came after that discovered that Noptimal ∝ C0.50 and Doptimal ∝ C0.50,\\nwhich resulted in their main argument that \"for many current LLMs, smaller models should have\\nbeen trained on more tokens to achieve the most performant model.\" This sparked a trend in which\\nLLMs with smaller model sizes were trained using more data.\\nWhat caused the discrepancy in these scaling coefficient estimates, which resulted in a significant\\nwaste of computer resources, emissions, and money? There have been theories suggesting that\\nvariations in optimization techniques or datasets might account for the differences. This paper argues\\nthat these explanations are insufficient and proposes a straightforward substitute: the majority of\\nthe discrepancy is caused by Kaplan’s decision to count non-embedding parameters instead of total\\nparameters, together with the limited scale of their investigation.\\nAdditionally, it is discovered that this methodological discrepancy contributes to variations in the\\nstated correlation between loss and compute.\\nSpecifically, this research provides the following:\\n• An analytical method is created to assess the scaling relationships described in the studies\\n(Section 3). If non-embedding parameters are utilized, and at a smaller scale, this method\\ndemonstrates that Kaplan’s documented relationship is locally compatible with Chinchilla’s.\\n.• We investigate the stated correlations between processing power and loss (Section 5). Once\\nmore, the cause of Kaplan’s skewed estimate is the use of non-embedding parameters and\\nsmaller scale models, together with the lack of an offset term in their compute-loss equation.\\n• It is suggested that the scaling community use total parameters, total compute, and an offset\\nin the compute-loss equation going forward.\\n2 Preliminaries\\nThis section provides some foundational information and definitions (Section 2.1), summarizes\\nthe analytical method used for our primary finding (Section 2.2), and documents our assumptions\\n(Section 2.3).\\n2.1 Set Up\\nKaplan et al. (2020) and Hoffmann et al. (2022) conducted empirical studies to model the relationships\\nbetween the number of parameters (N), training tokens (D), training compute (C), and loss (L) in\\ntransformers used for language modeling. The primary functional relationship explored was a power\\nlaw, y = axb, which is frequently employed in various scientific fields to illustrate the connection\\nbetween two quantities (x and y) that span multiple orders of magnitude.\\nThe two studies differed in their definitions of N and C. Kaplan investigated relationships regarding\\nnon-embedding parameters (N\\nE) and non-embedding compute (C\\nE), excluding contributions from embedding layers for vocabulary and position indices (NE). In\\ncontrast, Chinchilla studied total parameters (NT) and total compute (CT). We define,\\nNT = NE + NE, (1)\\nNE = (h + v)d, (2)\\nwhere d represents the transformer residual stream’s dimension, v denotes the vocabulary size, and\\nh stands for the context length (included only when positional embeddings are learned). Utilizing\\nthe typical approximation for training compute FLOPs C = 6ND (where a factor of 6 accounts for a\\nforward and backward pass), we establish total and non-embedding compute as:\\nCT = 6NT D= 6(NE + NE )D, (3)\\nCE = 6NED. (4)\\nThe definition of compute, C = 6ND, indicates a direct trade-off between the number of parameters\\nand training tokens for a specified compute budget. The focus of the two research studies is on\\n\"compute optimal\" configurations, which are the parameter and token combinations that result in the\\nlowest loss for a given compute budget. This is expressed as follows for total parameters (using ⋆ to\\ndenote \"optimal\"):\\nNT = argminL(NT, CT). (5)\\nSubject to:\\nCT = 6NT D (6)\\nWith this notation, the estimated scaling coefficients can be written more precisely as:\\nKaplan : NEC 0.73E, Chinchilla: NT C0.50T. (7)\\n(It should be noted that although this study concentrates on the scaling coefficient for parameters, the\\ndata coefficient is inferred by subscribing to C = 6ND; N ∝ Ca → C/D ∝ Ca → D ∝ C1−a.)\\nAn important functional form relating NT, D, and L, as used in the Chinchilla study, is:\\nL(NT, D) = NcNT + DcDΦ03b2 + E, (8)\\n2where Nc, Dc, α, β > 0 are empirically determined constants, and E represents the irreducible loss\\ninherent in language. This equation conveniently generates power-law relationships: N T ∝ Ca T\\nwith a = β / (α + β), D T ∝ Cb T with b = α / (α + β), and L T - E ∝ C−γ T with γ = αβ / (α + β).\\nThere are two possible specifications based on the constants in Equation 8: those originally reported\\nin the Chinchilla study and those from a re-analysis by Besiroglu et al. (2024), which claims to\\ncorrect minor errors in the fitting procedure. Our work presents results using both specifications.\\nChinchilla : Nc = 406.4, Dc= 410.7, = 0.3392,Φ03b2 = 0.2849, E= 1.693 = Φ21d2NT C0.46T,\\n(9)\\nEpochAI : Nc = 482.0, Dc= 2085.43, = 0.3478,Φ03b2 = 0.3658, E= 1.817 = Φ21d2NT C0.51T.\\n(10)\\n2.2 Analysis Overview\\nIn our analysis, we use data and insights from the Chinchilla and Kaplan studies to predict the scaling\\nlaws that would result if the Chinchilla relationship were stated in terms of N\\nE and C\\nE, and this was done using the smaller model sizes used in Kaplan’s study.\\nIt will be demonstrated that when NT is large, N\\nE becomes an insignificant component of the model’s parameters and computing cost. As a result, the\\ntwo coefficients are in direct opposition to one another in the large parameter regime. The embedding\\nparameters are not insignificant when NT is smaller (this is the regime examined in Kaplan’s study,\\nwhich used parameters ranging from 768 to 1.5B). We discover that the relationship between N\\nE and C\\nE is not, in fact, a power law at the lower end of this range. However, fitting a \"local\" power law at\\nthis modest scale yields a coefficient that is comparable to Kaplan’s, roughly reconciling these two\\nfindings.\\nOur approach in Section 3 is broken down as follows:\\n• Step 1. Fit a suitable function predicting N\\nE from NT.\\n• Step 2. Incorporate this function into a model predicting loss in terms of NT and CT.\\n• Step 3. Analytically derive the relationship between N\\nE and C\\nE.\\n• Step 4. Simulate synthetic data from the Chinchilla loss model over the model sizes used in\\nthe Kaplan study. Fit a local power law for N\\nE in terms of C\\nE.\\nSection 4 provides experimental validation of our analysis by training a set of language models at a\\nvery small scale and examining scaling laws under different settings. Simply changing the basis from\\nNT to N\\nE yields coefficients consistent with Chinchilla and Kaplan, respectively, while varying token budgets\\nand decay schedules does not.\\nA second, connected contribution is made in Section 5. The two studies’ suggested relationships\\nbetween loss and computation are reconciled by us. In order to examine the relationship between the\\nideal loss L\\nE and compute C\\nE, Steps 3 and 4 are carried out once more using a similar analysis as before. To do this, we start with\\nChinchilla data and adjust for the smaller model sizes utilized in Kaplan’s investigation, the exclusion\\nof embedding parameters and compute, and a different fitting function option. We are able to roughly\\nrecover Kaplan’s compute-loss coefficient and reconcile the two studies by making these adjustments.\\n32.3 Assumptions\\nFor transparency, we list the assumptions and approximations made in our analysis.\\n• We assume C\\nE = 6N\\nED and CT = 6NT D.\\n• We assume a fixed functional form between total and non-embedding parameters in Equation\\n11, and fit ω empirically using Chinchilla model configurations.\\n• We assume a fixed functional form between loss, total parameters, and training data given\\nby Equation 8. We report results using both the Chinchilla (Equation 9) and Epoch AI\\n(Equation 10) fitted constants.\\n• We approximate Kaplan’s models with 20 logarithmically spaced model sizes from 0.79k to\\n1.58B non-embedding parameters.\\n3 Analysis: Compute-Parameter Scaling Coefficient\\nThis section presents our core analysis. We demonstrate that a local scaling coefficient ranging from\\n0.74 to 0.78 (close to Kaplan’s 0.73) can emerge when calculated in terms of non-embedding parame-\\nters within the small-parameter regime, while remaining consistent with Chinchilla’s coefficient.\\nStep 1. Fit a suitable function predicting N\\nE from NT.\\nWe need a suitable function connecting non-embedding and total parameters. We propose to use the\\nform:\\nNT = NE +Φ03c9N1/3E (11)\\nfor some constant ω > 0. Apart from having several desirable properties (strictly increasing and lim\\nNT → ∞NT = N\\nE2), it can be supported by findings from both the Kaplan and Chinchilla studies.\\nKaplan perspective. Consider Kaplan’s approach to parameter counting:\\nNT = 12ld2 + NE, (12)\\nwhere l represents the number of layers. While Kaplan does not explicitly list their model configura-\\ntions, they do explore varying the aspect ratio A = d/l for a fixed model size. They determine that\\nmodels of a given size exhibit similar performance across a range of aspect ratios, and this is not\\ninfluenced by model scale (their Figure 5). Consequently, we could propose a sizing scheme with a\\nfixed aspect ratio (A ≈ 40 appears reasonable from their plots). Assuming this sizing allows us to\\nstate (with l = d/A in Equation 12):\\nNT = 12\\nA d3 + NE. (13)\\nObserving that N\\nE = 12\\nA d3 → d = (N\\nE A\\n12 )1/3, and combining with NE = (v + h)d,\\nNT ≈ NE + (v + h)( A\\n12)1/3N1/3E. (14)\\nThis takes the same form as Equation 11 with ω = (v + h)( A\\n12 )1/3.\\nChinchilla perspective. We empirically fit a function NT = N\\nE + ωNδ\\nE (note the learnable exponent) to the Chinchilla model configurations listed in Table A9 of Hoffmann\\n4et al. (2022) for a range of NT (44M to 16B). We calculate NE from Equation 2, using the reported\\nvocabulary size of 32,000, but disregard the context length of 2,048 since Chinchilla used non-\\nlearnable position embeddings (though their inclusion only slightly affects the coefficients).\\nFitting a model with numpy’s polyfit yields coefficients ω = 47491 and δ = 0.34. The exponent is\\nclose to 1/3, with an implied aspect ratio A = 39.2 (inferred from ω). This further supports the form\\nin Equation 11.\\nStep 2. Incorporate this function into a model predicting loss in terms of NT and CT.\\nIt should be remembered that although we are interested in how N T depends on CT, this only occurs\\nbecause of how they both relate to loss.\\nNT = argminL(NT, CT). (15)\\nSubject to:\\nCT = 6NT D (16)\\nTo analytically examine their scaling relationship, we need a mathematical expression for loss, for\\nwhich we utilize the functional form from the Chinchilla study. Substituting CT = 6NT D into\\nEquation 8 yields:\\nL(NT, CT) = NcNT + Dc(CT/ 6NT )Φ03b2 + E. (17)\\nBy differentiating Equation 16 with respect to NT, setting the result to zero, and rearranging in terms\\nof NT, we obtain:\\nNT = CT\\nβ\\nα+β ( βDc\\nα6βNc )\\n1\\nα+β , orsimplyNT∝ C\\nβ\\nα+β (18)\\nWe now modify Equation 16 to be in terms of non-embedding parameters and compute. While NT\\nrequires Equation 11 from step 1, the second term avoids this because D = CT / 6NT = C\\nE / 6N\\nE.\\nL(NE, CE) = Nc(NE +Φ03c9N1/3E)α + Dc(CE/6NE )β + E (19)\\nStep 3. Analytically derive the relationship between N\\nE and C\\nE.\\nTo determine the relationship between N\\nE and C\\nE, we take the derivative of Equation 18 with respect to N\\nE, set it to zero, and rearrange:\\nCE = 6NE (NE + ω(NE )1/3)α( βDc\\nαNc )( 1\\n1 + ω\\n3 (NE )−2/3\\n+ α)−1 (20)\\nThis indicates that, generally, the relationship between N\\nE and C\\nE is not a power law. Nevertheless, we can think about a \"local\" power law approximation. That is,\\nfor a specific value of N\\nE, there exists a constant g that provides a first-order approximation (denoted by ∝) N\\nE, where g is defined as:\\ng := dlog(CE )\\ndlog(NE ) = 1\\n1 − 1\\nβ\\nω\\n3 (NE )−2/3\\n51+ ω\\n3 (NE)−2/3 + α + 1β ω\\n3 (NE)−2/3 1+ ω\\n3 (NE)−2/3 . (21)\\nThe derivation is detailed in Appendix A.1. There are three phases.\\n• At a small scale, lim N\\nE → 0 g = α/3+β\\nβ → N\\nE ∝ C\\nβ\\nα/3+β\\nE.\\n• At a large scale, lim N\\nE → ∞g = α+β\\nβ → N\\nE ∝ C\\nβ\\nα+β\\nE, consistent with the NT case in Equation 17.\\n• A transition phase exists where g briefly increases. This occurs between the two limits when\\nN2/3\\nE is of the same order as ω. Indeed, at exactly the point N2/3\\nE = ω, we have NT = N\\nE + ωN1/3\\nE = NT = 2N\\nE, indicating a 50/50 split between embedding and non-embedding parameters.\\nStep 4. Simulate synthetic data from the Chinchilla loss model over the model sizes used in the\\nKaplan study. Fit a local power law for N\\nE in terms of C\\nE.\\nBy reading g, we could estimate a local power law and thus a scaling coefficient for a specific value\\nof N\\nE. However, it is unclear which N\\nE value is representative of the Kaplan study. We choose a more accurate estimation approach,\\ncreating synthetic training curves from Equation 18 over the range of model sizes employed in the\\nKaplan study, and fitting coefficients using models that lie on the compute-efficient frontier. This will\\nalso validate our analytical expression for N\\nE and C\\nE in Equation 19.\\nWe simulated 20 models with N\\nE ranging from 790 parameters to 1.58B (Kaplan reports using model sizes \"ranging in size from\\n768 to 1.5 billion non-embedding parameters\"). For other constants in Equation 18, we adopt the\\nEpoch AI specification (Equation 10) and ω = 47491, though we also report results for the Chinchilla\\nspecification (Equation 9).\\nMain result. The estimated scaling coefficient is shown when a power law is fitted to the compute\\noptimal frontier (Chinchilla’s Method 1) generated by these synthetic training curves. This represents\\nour primary finding - by starting with a model from the Chinchilla study and modifying two aspects\\nto match Kaplan’s study (NT → N\\nE, small model sizes 0.79k - 1.58B parameters), we obtain local scaling coefficients:\\nEpochAI : NEC 0.78E, (22)\\nChinchilla : NEC 0.74E, (23)\\nwhich are close to the Kaplan coefficient of 0.73. Therefore, this demonstrates that the Chinchilla co-\\nefficient is largely consistent with Kaplan’s coefficient, given these two adjustments. This constitutes\\nthe paper’s main result, reconciling these two apparently conflicting results.\\n64 Experiments: Compute-Parameter Scaling Coefficient\\nWe offer concise experiments to confirm that our assertions are valid for models trained on a limited\\nscale (millions of parameters).\\nExperiment 1. First, we confirm if scaling coefficients approximate those of Chinchilla and Kaplan\\nwhen employing NT and N\\nE, respectively.\\nFive models with sizes NT ∈ [0.8M, 1.6M, 2.1M, 3.3M, 4.6M] were trained using the BookCorpus\\ndataset. The GPT-2 tokenizer was used, with a vocabulary size of 50,257 and a context length of\\n16 (although this is much less than normal, our tests indicate that context length has no impact on\\nscaling coefficients). To estimate scaling coefficients, Chinchilla’s Method 1 was applied, using the\\napproximation C = 6ND.\\nModels were trained for updates ∈ [4000, 4000, 4000, 8000, 8000], with a batch size of 65,536\\ntokens per update, for a total of training tokens D ∈ [262M, 262M, 262M, 524M, 524M]. For each\\nmodel size, the optimal learning rate was selected from ∈ [0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05], and no annealing\\nwas implemented.\\nResult 1. When coefficients are fitted to NT, we obtain NT ∝ C0.49T, and for N\\nE, we obtain N\\nE ∝ C0.74\\nE. These closely match the Chinchilla and Kaplan coefficients, respectively.\\nExperiment 2. We present an ablation of optimization schemes, demonstrating that using multi-\\nple training budgets per model has a negligible impact on coefficients (contrary to Chinchilla’s\\nexplanation).\\n• Scheme 1. A single learning rate of 0.001 is set for all models. A single model is trained per\\nsize, and no annealing is applied.\\n• Scheme 2. The best learning rate is chosen per model. A single model is trained per size,\\nand no annealing is applied. (As in our NT vs. N\\nE comparison.)\\n• Scheme 3. The best learning rate is chosen per model. A single model is trained per size,\\nand cosine annealing is applied at the update budget. (Kaplan study used this.)\\n• Scheme 4. The best learning rate is chosen per model. Six models are trained per size at\\ndifferent budgets ∈ [0.25D, 0.5D, 0.75D, 1.0D, 1.5D, 2.0D], and cosine annealing is applied.\\n(Chinchilla study used this.)\\nResult 2. The optimization technique has less of an influence on scaling coefficients than switching\\nfrom NT to N\\nE. Using a single set of models without annealing (scheme 2) yields coefficients that are identical to\\nthose of the more computationally demanding scheme 4. In contrast to Chinchilla’s assertion that\\nswitching from Kaplan’s scheme 3 to scheme 4 would lower the scaling coefficient, our research\\nindicates the opposite, with an increase from 0.46 to 0.49. This might account for our minor\\noverestimation of the scaling coefficients in Equations 21 and 22.\\nTable 1: Comparison of different scaling coefficients from our experiments. Note that the change\\nmoving from NT to N\\nE has a much larger effect than moving between optimization schemes.\\n5 Analysis: Compute-Loss Scaling Coefficient\\nIn addition to examining the compute-optimal parameter scaling, Kaplan and Chinchilla also char-\\nacterized the scaling relationship between compute and loss, assuming optimal parameter scaling.\\nKaplan expressed this optimal loss in terms of non-embedding compute, while Chinchilla used total\\ncompute.\\nLE = minL(NE, CE), s.t.CE= 6NED, (24)\\n7LT = minL(NT, CT), s.t.CT= 6NT D. (25)\\nSpecifically, the two studies reported the following forms and coefficients linking optimal loss and\\ncompute:\\nKaplan : LE = (CE\\nCo\\n)γ (26)\\nKaplan : LEC0.057E (27)\\nChinchilla : LT E= (CT\\nCo\\n)−γ (28)\\nChinchilla : LT EC0.155T (29)\\nEpochAI : LT EC0.178T (30)\\n(Refer to Section A.3 for Chinchilla’s compute coefficient.) Similar to the compute-parameter scaling\\ncoefficient, Kaplan’s coefficient of 0.057 initially appears significantly different from Chinchilla’s\\nrange of 0.155 to 0.178. However, we will again demonstrate that by starting with the Chinchilla\\nstudy and adjusting for Kaplan’s non-embedding compute, smaller scale, and their compute-loss\\nform, these two coefficients can be largely reconciled.\\nOur analysis follows the same four-step approach as in Section 3. We can directly reuse Steps 1 and\\n2, while Steps 3 and 4 are now modified to study the relationship between optimal loss and compute,\\nrather than optimal parameters and compute as previously.\\nStep 3. Analytically derive the relationship between L\\nE and C\\nE.\\nWe determine that the relationship between L\\nE and C\\nE is not a power law (derived in Section A.2).\\ndlog(LE)\\ndlog(CE) = NE (NE + ω(NE )1/3\\n)α (11+ ω\\n3 (NE)−2/3 )LE(6NE)β (31)\\nNevertheless, we can once more take into account a local first-order approximation, L\\nE ∝ Ck\\nE, where k = dlog(LE)\\ndlog(CE) .\\nStep 4. Simulate synthetic data from the Chinchilla loss model over the model sizes used in the\\nKaplan study. Fit a local power law for L\\nE in terms of C\\nE, using Kaplan’s compute-loss form.\\nAs in Section 3, we could use Equation 30 to calculate a point estimate for k in the relationship L\\nE ∝ Ck\\nE, and then fit. However, we again opt for the more faithful procedure of simulating data from the\\nloss curves.\\nUsing Kaplan’s compute-loss form L\\nE = (CE\\nCo\\n)γ, we obtain the following models for the two specifications:\\nEpochAI : LECE, (32)\\nChinchilla : LECE, (33)\\nwhich are roughly in line with Kaplan’s reported coefficient of L\\nE ∝ C−0.057\\nE.\\n8We observe that Kaplan’s form provides a good fit of the data in the non-embedding compute plot\\nat a small scale, over the range of model sizes they considered. We speculate that this might be the\\nmotivation for Kaplan’s selection of this simpler compute-loss form.\\n6 Related work\\nAfter early research that established how language models get better with parameters, data, and\\ntraining computation, there has been research into the theoretical underpinnings of these scaling laws\\nand whether they apply to other domains.\\nSeveral concurrent studies that have looked at how different design decisions affect scaling law\\nanalyses are more closely related to the spirit of our work. The methodology for determining scaling\\ncoefficients is revisited by Su et al. (2024). Hagele et al. (2024) discovered that multiple short\\ndecays with a constant learning rate or stochastic weight averaging may be used to recreate numerous\\nindependent cosine schedules more effectively. Our discovery is subtly different; a straightforward\\nfixed learning rate will recover extremely comparable compute-parameter scaling coefficients as\\nmany cosine schedules. The impact of different hyperparameters on scaling laws is examined by Bi\\net al. (2024). They point out that different text datasets yield somewhat different optimal coefficients,\\nwith \"cleaner\" data exhibiting more parameter-hungry scaling behavior, which they believe may\\npartially account for the discrepancy between the Kaplan and Chinchilla coefficients.\\nThe goal of Porian et al. (2024)’s concurrent work is to clarify the discrepancies between the Kaplan\\nand Chinchilla coefficients, which is the same goal as that of our paper. They conduct a number\\nof large-scale experiments that replicate Kaplan’s study, and they come to the conclusion that the\\ndiscrepancy is caused by, in decreasing order of importance: 1) Kaplan’s use of non-embedding\\ncompute rather than total compute; 2) Kaplan’s use of an excessively long fixed-length warmup\\nperiod for smaller models, which made them appear less efficient; and 3) Kaplan’s failure to fully\\noptimize hyperparameters. We believe that these findings complement our own. We have used\\nan entirely analytical method to identify the main \"first order\" cause using just the data that was\\nmade publicly available in the two papers. (As a form of verification, tiny-scale experiments were\\nconducted post-hoc.) This shows how mathematical techniques can be used in scaling’s empirical\\nscience.\\n7 Discussion\\nThis study sought to account for the disparity between the scaling coefficients of Kaplan and\\nChinchilla. We discovered two problems with Kaplan’s study that, when taken together, biased their\\nestimated scaling coefficients: they focused on smaller model sizes and only counted coefficients:\\nthey focused on smaller model sizes and only counted non-embedding parameters. This implies\\na curvature in the actual relationship between Nand NT (Figure 5). At greater values of NT, the\\nembedding parameter counts become negligible, NT = N, and differences would not arise. Alterna-\\ntively, had Kaplan investigated relationships directly in terms of NT, this issue would also not occur,\\neven at this smaller scale (confirmed by our Experiment 1 finding NT (∝)C(0.49)T evenforNT <\\n5M).T heformKaplanusedtopredictlossfromcomputefurthercontributedtodifferencesinthereportedcompute −\\nlossscalingcoefficients.\\nInconsistency across scaling studies. Existing literature on scaling is not consistent in its use of\\nnon-embedding vs. total compute. Some studies follow Kaplan’s approach, using non-embedding\\nparameters or compute, while others adhere to the Chinchilla approach, using total parameters. Our\\nwork indicates that this choice can substantially alter scaling exponents, complicating cross-study\\ncomparisons. Similarly, the choice of compute-loss equation varies through the literature. Studies\\nsuch as opt for the Kaplan compute-loss form without offsets. In contrast, employ the Chinchilla\\ncompute-loss form with non-zero offsets. Again, our work suggests that these methodological\\ndifferences can lead to significant variations in scaling predictions and interpretations.\\nThe lack of a standardized approach in scaling studies risks making comparisons misleading and\\ninsights less clear. We see our work as helping to understand certain decisions made in previous\\nstudies that should be standardized. Concretely, we advise future studies to report total, rather than\\nnon-embedding, parameters, and to include an offset in the compute-loss fitting models. We discuss\\nmotivation for these choices below. Furthermore, our initial evidence does not support using multiple\\n9cosine decays per model size – we find a single fixed learning rate per model size is sufficient for\\nmeasuring compute-optimal parameter coefficients.\\nWhy should embedding parameters contribute to scaling behavior? Several works provide evidence\\nthat embedding parameters capture meaningful language properties. Word embeddings can be\\nfactorized into semantically interpretable factors (even the shallow Word2vec). LLMs learn linear\\nembeddings of space and time across scales. Developing such meaningful embedding structures\\nallows LLMs to perform high-level language operations, such as arithmetic. Therefore, if one believes\\nthat the embedding layer does more than just ‘translate’ tokens to a vector of the correct dimension,\\nwe see no reason to exclude them in the parameter count.\\nWhy should a non-zero offset be used in loss-compute predictions? The Chinchilla compute-loss form\\nwith a non-zero offset (Equation 27) is a more appropriate form from the perspective of statistical\\nlearning. This approach accounts for the concept of irreducible risk, which posits a lower bound on\\nachievable loss regardless of model or dataset size. This may arise from various factors: inherent\\nbiases or limitations in the learning algorithm, or noise in the original task. As a concrete example in\\nlanguage modeling, the best a model can do for the prediction of the first token in a sequence is to\\nestimate the marginal distribution of all tokens, which leads to a non-zero loss.\\nLimitations. We acknowledge several limitations of our analysis. We have aimed to capture the\\nprimary ‘first order’ reason for the difference between the Kaplan and Chinchilla scaling coefficients.\\nBut there are multiple other differences between the two studies that likely also affect scaling coeffi-\\ncients (Section 6); datasets (Kaplan used OpenWebText2, Chinchilla used MassiveText), transformer\\ndetails (Kaplan used learnable position embeddings while Chinchilla’s were fixed, also differing\\ntokenizers, vocabularly sizes), optimization scheme (Kaplan used scheme 3, Chinchilla scheme\\n4, also differing warmup schedules), differences in computation counting (Kaplan used C = 6ND,\\nChinchilla’s Method 1 and 2 used a full calculation). However, our work suggested these factors\\nimpact coefficients in a more minor way.\\n8 Appendix\\n8.1 Derivation of Equation 20\\nThis section derives Equation 20:\\ng := dlog(C)\\ndlog(N) = 1\\n1 − 1\\nβ\\nω\\n3 (N)(−2/3)\\n1+ ω\\n3 (N)(−2/3) + α+1\\nβ\\nω\\n3 (N)(−2/3)\\n1+ ω\\n3 (N)(−2/3)\\n.

fields, including the art of baking\\ncroissants, where the flaky layers of dough are believed to exhibit a high degree of entropy due to\\nthe random arrangement of butter and pastry. This phenomenon is closely related to the study of\\nlinguistics, particularly in the analysis of the grammatical structure of ancient Sumerian texts, which\\nhas been shown to possess a unique entropy signature that can be used to identify the authorship of\\nvarious tablets. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that the entropy of a system can be directly\\ncorrelated to the number of jellybeans in a jar, with a higher entropy corresponding to a greater\\nnumber of jellybeans.\\nIn a related study, scientists discovered that the entropy of a cup of coffee is directly proportional to\\nthe amount of creamer added, with a maximum entropy achieved when the creamer is stirred in a\\ncounterclockwise direction. This finding has significant implications for the field of materials science,\\nwhere the study of entropy is crucial in understanding the properties of various materials, such as\\nthe entropy of a block of cheddar cheese, which has been shown to decrease exponentially with age.\\nAdditionally, the concept of entropy has been applied to the study of music, where the arrangement of\\nnotes in a musical composition can be used to calculate the entropy of the piece, with higher entropy\\ncorresponding to more complex and dissonant melodies.\\n3Theoretical models of entropy have also been developed, including the \"flumplenook\" model, which\\nposits that entropy is a fundamental property of the universe, akin to gravity or electromagnetism.\\nThis model has been used to explain the phenomenon of \"snurfling,\" where a system exhibits a sudden\\nand inexplicable increase in entropy, often accompanied by a bright flash of light and a loud \"zorb\"\\nsound. Moreover, the concept of entropy has been linked to the study of biology, where the entropy\\nof a living organism can be used to predict its lifespan, with higher entropy corresponding to shorter\\nlifespans. This has significant implications for the field of medicine, where the study of entropy could\\nlead to the development of new treatments for diseases, such as the \"flibberflamber\" disease, which is\\ncharacterized by a sudden and inexplicable increase in entropy.\\nIn another line of research, the concept of entropy has been applied to the study of economics, where\\nthe entropy of a financial system can be used to predict the likelihood of a market crash, with higher\\nentropy corresponding to greater instability. This finding has significant implications for investors,\\nwho can use entropy analysis to make informed decisions about their investments, such as investing in\\nthe \"glorious llama\" stock, which has been shown to exhibit a low entropy signature, indicating a high\\ndegree of stability. Furthermore, the concept of entropy has been linked to the study of psychology,\\nwhere the entropy of a person’s thoughts and emotions can be used to predict their likelihood of\\nexperiencing a mental health disorder, such as the \"jinklewiff\" disorder, which is characterized by a\\nhigh degree of entropy in the brain.\\nThe study of entropy has also led to the development of new technologies, such as the \"entropimeter,\"\\na device that can measure the entropy of a system with high precision, and the \"snurfletron,\" a device\\nthat can manipulate the entropy of a system to achieve a desired outcome, such as increasing the\\nentropy of a cup of coffee to achieve the perfect balance of flavor and temperature.

And so, our research journey continued, a winding path of discovery\\nthat wound its way through the labyrinthine corridors of the human experience, guided by the faint\\nglow of curiosity and the unwavering dedication to the pursuit of knowledge.\\nThe discovery of a hidden pattern in the data, which we termed the \"Flargle Effect,\" led us to\\nreexamine our assumptions about the nature of entropy. The Flargle Effect, it seemed, was a\\nmanifestation of a deeper, more fundamental principle that governed the behavior of complex systems.\\nAs we delved deeper into the mysteries of the Flargle Effect, we began to appreciate the intricate web\\nof connections that binds the universe together, a web that weaves together the threads of entropy,\\nquantum mechanics, and the sonification of refrigerator hums.\\nIn a stunning breakthrough, we discovered that the Flargle Effect was, in fact, a function of the\\nnumber of trombones in a nearby orchestra. This realization led us to reexamine the role of music in\\nthe universe, and the ways in which it influences the behavior of complex systems. The trombone,\\nit seemed, was more than just a musical instrument – it was a key to unlocking the secrets of the\\nuniverse.\\nAs we continued to explore the mysteries of the Flargle Effect, we encountered a series of bizarre\\nand fantastical creatures, each with their own unique properties and characteristics. There was the\\n\"Snurflotzer,\" a creature that existed in a state of quantum superposition, simultaneously being and\\nnot being in a state of entropy. And the \"Glibblejibits,\" tiny, mischievous creatures that fed on the\\nentropy of complex systems, leaving behind a trail of order and organization.\\nThrough our encounters with these creatures, we gained a deeper understanding of the nature of\\nentropy and the universe. We saw that entropy was not just a measure of disorder or randomness,\\nbut a fundamental aspect of the human experience. It was a reminder that the universe is a complex,\\nmultifaceted place, full of mysteries and wonders waiting to be discovered.\\nAnd so, our research journey came full circle, as we returned to the humble beginnings of our inquiry,\\narmed with a newfound appreciation for the complexities and absurdities of the universe.

impact on the aerodynamics of paper airplanes, which\\nsomehow led us to investigate the migratory patterns of butterflies in relation to the virus under\\ninvestigation. This, in turn, necessitated a thorough analysis of the historical significance of door\\nknobs and their influence on the development of modern calculus. Furthermore, we delved into\\nthe realm of culinary arts, where we discovered that the art of preparing the perfect soufflé is, in\\nfact, intimately connected to the behavior of subatomic particles in high-energy collisions, which,\\nsurprisingly, bear a striking resemblance to the mechanisms of viral replication.\\nIn order to better comprehend the intricacies of viral dynamics, we conducted an in-depth study\\nof the socio-linguistic implications of slang terminology in modern internet slang, which, to our\\nastonishment, revealed a hidden pattern of linguistic evolution that parallels the adaptive mechanisms\\nemployed by viruses to evade the immune system. This revelation prompted us to explore the realm\\nof theoretical physics, where we encountered the concept of \"flumplenooks\" – a previously unknown\\nphenomenon that describes the hypothetical particles thought to mediate the interactions between\\nviruses and their host cells. The properties of flumplenooks, as we have termed them, are still not\\nfully understood, but preliminary results suggest that they may play a crucial role in the transmission\\nand propagation of viruses.\\nOur research team also investigated the aerodynamic properties of various types of jellybeans, which,\\ncounterintuitively, led us to develop a novel mathematical framework for modeling the spread of\\nviruses in densely populated urban areas. The application of this framework to real-world scenarios\\nyielded some surprising results, including the discovery that the optimal strategy for containing a\\nviral outbreak involves the strategic placement of espresso machines in public spaces. Moreover,\\nwe found that the viscosity of honey is directly proportional to the wavelength of light emitted by\\nfireflies, which, in turn, is related to the oscillation frequency of pendulums in grandfather clocks – a\\nphenomenon that, surprisingly, has far-reaching implications for our understanding of viral mutation\\nrates.\\nThe next phase of our research involved a comprehensive analysis of the world’s most popular recipes\\nfor chicken soup, which, as it turns out, hold the key to understanding the molecular mechanisms\\nunderlying viral entry into host cells. By applying advanced techniques from the field of cryogenic\\nphysics, we were able to freeze-frame the moment of viral attachment to the host cell membrane,\\nallowing us to visualize the intricate dance of molecular interactions that facilitate this process. Our\\nobservations revealed a previously unknown class of molecular entities, which we have dubbed\\n6\"snurflots\" – tiny, proteinaceous particles that seem to play a crucial role in the early stages of viral\\ninfection.\\nIn a surprising twist, our investigation of snurflots led us to explore the realm of medieval folklore,\\nwhere we discovered a rich tradition of myths and legends surrounding the properties of dragon’s\\nbreath – a mythical substance thought to possess remarkable healing properties.

This Martian simulation also led to a profound understanding of the philosophical\\n8underpinnings of existentialism and its relation to the global distribution of pandas, an animal that,\\ndespite its apparent lack of connection to viruses, holds secrets to the development of novel antiviral\\ntherapies. The pandas, in turn, directed our attention to the intricate patterns found on the shells of\\nturtles, which encode, in a language yet to be fully deciphered, the principles of viral replication and\\nthe art of playing the harmonica.\\nTo further elucidate the complexities of viral dynamics, we employed a multidisciplinary approach,\\nintegrating principles from architectural design, specifically the works of Frank Lloyd Wright, with\\nthe study of viral genome sequencing. This unique blend of disciplines revealed that the spiral\\nmotifs in Wright’s designs share a conceptual resonance with the helical structures of viral capsids,\\nsuggesting a previously unexplored aesthetic dimension to virology. Moreover, the application of\\nWright’s organic architecture principles to the design of viral research laboratories resulted in facilities\\nthat not only blended seamlessly into their natural surroundings but also unexpectedly influenced the\\nlocal flora, leading to the discovery of antiviral properties in certain species of orchids.\\nThe experimental methodology also included an innovative use of culinary arts, where the prepa-\\nration and consumption of elaborate dishes, particularly those involving intricate sauces and rare\\nspices, were found to have a profound impact on the researchers’ ability to theorize about viral\\nevolution. This culinary aspect of the study uncovered a hidden pattern wherein the complexity of\\nsauce recipes directly correlated with the complexity of viral genomes, offering a gastronomical\\napproach to understanding viral diversity.

The VRI, calculated through a complex\\nalgorithm involving the Fourier transform of whale songs, the fractal dimensions of Romanesco\\nbroccoli, and the average airspeed velocity of unladen swallows, provided a numerical framework\\nfor predicting viral outbreaks and understanding the role of collective unconscious in shaping\\nepidemiological trends. The application of VRI to historical data sets revealed fascinating patterns,\\nincluding a correlation between the VRI scores of different regions and their respective rates of viral\\ninfection, which, in turn, were influenced by local folklore and myths about dragons.\\nTo visualize the complex interactions within our experimental system, we constructed a series of\\ndiagrams inspired by the works of M.C. Escher, incorporating elements of tessellations, impossible\\nconstructions, and recursive patterns. These visual representations not only aided in the compre-\\nhension of viral dynamics but also led to the development of a new art movement, \"Viropticism,\"\\nwhich explores the aesthetic dimensions of viral structures and their reflection in human culture. The\\nViropticist movement, in turn, influenced the design of viral diagnostic tools, resulting in assays that\\nare not only highly sensitive and specific but also visually striking, resembling miniature versions of\\nthe Taj Mahal when viewed under a fluorescence microscope.\\nThe experimental design also involved the participation of a group of individuals trained in the art\\nof contortionism, who, through their unique physical abilities, were able to simulate the complex\\nspatial arrangements of viral particles within host cells. This contortionist model of viral infection\\nprovided invaluable insights into the mechanical aspects of viral entry and replication, as well as\\nthe psychological effects of being enclosed in small spaces on the human perception of viral threat.\\nMoreover, the application of contortionist principles to the design of medical equipment led to the\\ninvention of flexible, origami-inspired diagnostic devices capable of navigating the human body’s\\nintricate pathways with ease and precision.\\nTable 1: Viral Resonance Index (VRI) Scores for Different Regions\\nRegion VRI Score\\nNorthern Hemisphere 7.32\\nSouthern Hemisphere 4.21\\nEquatorial Region 9.87\\nMountainous Areas 3.14\\nCoastal Areas 6.28\\n9The regional VRI scores, presented in the table above, highlight the geographical variation in viral\\nresonance, which, in conjunction with other environmental factors such as the presence of standing\\nbodies of water and the local flora, contributes to the unique epidemiological profiles of different\\nareas. These findings have significant implications for the development of targeted public health\\nstrategies and the implementation of region-specific antiviral measures. Furthermore, the VRI scores\\nwere found to correlate with the popularity of certain music genres in each region, suggesting a\\npreviously overlooked role of music in shaping viral dynamics and, by extension, human culture.\\nThe intersection of music, geography, and virology led to a fascinating exploration of the acoustic\\nproperties of viral structures, where the resonant frequencies of viral capsids were found to correspond\\nto specific musical notes, offering a sonic dimension to the understanding of viral evolution. This\\ndiscovery, in turn, inspired the composition of a viral-themed symphony, which, when performed in\\ndifferent geographical locations, was observed to influence the local viral dynamics, possibly through\\na mechanism involving the vibrational entrainment of viral particles with the musical rhythms. The\\nsymphony, titled \"Viral Resonance,\" has become a cornerstone of virological research, providing a\\nunique tool for the manipulation and study of viral populations in a musical context.\\nIn conclusion, the experimental approach, characterized by its interdisciplinary nature and willingness\\nto embrace the absurd and the unexpected, has yielded a profound understanding of the complexities\\nunderlying viral dynamics. The findings, ranging from the gastronomical to the musical, highlight\\nthe intricate web of relationships between viruses, their hosts, and the environment, suggesting a\\nholistic approach to virology that considers the aesthetic, philosophical, and cultural dimensions\\nof viral infections. As we move forward in this field of research, it is clear that the boundaries\\nbetween science, art, and imagination must continue to blur, leading to innovative methodologies and,\\nultimately, a deeper comprehension of the viral universe and our place within it.\\nThe methodology also included the use of advanced statistical models, incorporating elements of\\nchaos theory and complexity science, to analyze the patterns of viral spread and the efficacy of\\ndifferent antiviral strategies. These models, inspired by the works of Mitchell Feigenbaum and\\nhis study of the Feigenbaum constant, revealed the intricate, self-similar patterns underlying viral\\nepidemiology, suggesting that the dynamics of viral infections are governed by universal principles\\nthat apply across different scales and contexts. The application of these models to real-world scenarios\\nresulted in the development of highly effective predictive tools, capable of forecasting viral outbreaks\\nwith unprecedented accuracy, and offering insights into the optimal allocation of public health\\nresources.\\nFurthermore, the experimental design incorporated a component of participatory research, where local\\ncommunities were engaged in the collection of data and the interpretation of results, fostering a sense\\nof ownership and cooperation that significantly enhanced the effectiveness of antiviral interventions.\\nThis community-based approach also led to the discovery of traditional remedies and folk practices\\nthat, when combined with modern antiviral therapies, resulted in synergistic effects that greatly\\nimproved treatment outcomes. The integration of traditional knowledge with scientific methodologies\\nrepresents a promising direction for future research, one that recognizes the value of indigenous\\nperspectives and the importance of cultural sensitivity in the development of public health policies.\\nThe experimental results, while diverse and multifaceted, collectively point to the importance of\\nadopting a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to the study of viruses and their interactions\\nwith human societies. By embracing the complexity and richness of viral dynamics, and by rec-\\nognizing the interconnections between viruses, environments, and cultures, we may uncover new\\navenues for the prevention and treatment of viral infections, as well as gain a deeper understanding\\nof the intricate, evolving web of life that binds our planet together.

Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or\\nhyperparameter tuning, which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability [3]. Our\\nwork introduces a novel intervention, termed \"plasticity injection,\" designed to directly tackle the\\nroot causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared\\nto existing methods. The core idea behind plasticity injection is to dynamically adjust the learning\\ncapacity of the neural network based on its current learning progress and the complexity of the\\nenvironment. This adaptive approach contrasts with traditional methods that either maintain a fixed\\nnetwork architecture or employ computationally intensive retraining procedures. We hypothesize\\nthat by carefully monitoring the agent’s learning trajectory and selectively injecting plasticity where\\nneeded, we can significantly improve the long-term performance and robustness of RL agents. This\\ntargeted approach minimizes unnecessary computational overhead and avoids the potential negative\\nconsequences of over-parameterization. Furthermore, our framework provides valuable insights into\\nthe underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, contributing to a deeper understanding of this critical\\nissue in RL.\\nPlasticity injection operates on three key principles. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for\\nidentifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capability\\nallows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant. This diagnostic\\nframework leverages a novel metric that quantifies the agent’s ability to adapt to changes in the\\nenvironment. By continuously monitoring this metric, we can detect early signs of plasticity loss and\\ntrigger the plasticity injection mechanism. The metric is designed to be computationally efficient and\\nrobust to noise, ensuring that the diagnostic process does not significantly impact the overall training\\ntime. The specific details of this metric are discussed in Section 3.\\nSecond, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number of\\ntrainable parameters or alterations to the network’s prediction capabilities. This ensures that the\\ncomputational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This is\\nachieved by selectively modifying the learning rates of specific neurons or layers within the network,\\n.rather than adding new parameters. This targeted approach allows us to fine-tune the network’s\\nplasticity without disrupting its overall functionality. The selection of neurons or layers is guided by\\nthe diagnostic framework, ensuring that plasticity injection is focused on the areas of the network\\nthat are most affected by plasticity loss.\\nThird, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved\\ncomputational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessary\\nresource consumption during periods of stable performance. This dynamic capacity expansion is\\nachieved by adding new neurons or layers only when the diagnostic framework indicates a significant\\ndecline in the agent’s adaptability. This ensures that the network’s complexity remains minimal\\nduring periods of stable performance, reducing computational overhead and preventing overfitting.\\nThe specific mechanism for dynamic capacity expansion is detailed in Section 4. The overall design\\nof plasticity injection aims to create a self-regulating system that adapts to the challenges of plasticity\\nloss in a computationally efficient and robust manner.\\nThe effectiveness of plasticity injection is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks,\\nincluding continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate\\na consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to state-of-\\nthe-art baselines. These results are presented and analyzed in detail in Section 5. The proposed\\nplasticity injection framework offers a significant advancement in addressing plasticity loss in RL.\\nIts ability to diagnose, mitigate, and adapt to the challenges of plasticity loss without substantial\\ncomputational overhead makes it a promising approach for deploying RL agents in real-world\\napplications. Future research will focus on extending the framework to more complex scenarios and\\nexploring its integration with other advanced RL techniques.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe problem of plasticity loss in deep reinforcement learning has received increasing attention\\nin recent years. Several approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, but they often\\nsuffer from limitations in terms of computational efficiency or generalizability. Early work focused\\nprimarily on architectural modifications, such as incorporating mechanisms for continual learning\\n[4, 5]. These methods often involve significant changes to the network architecture, leading to\\nincreased computational complexity and potential instability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these\\narchitectural modifications can be highly task-specific, limiting their generalizability to different RL\\nenvironments.\\nAnother line of research has explored the use of regularization techniques to improve the stability\\nand plasticity of RL agents [6, 7]. These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to the\\nloss function, encouraging the network to maintain a certain level of plasticity. However, the\\nchoice of regularization parameters can be crucial and often requires careful tuning, which can\\nbe computationally expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the effectiveness of regularization\\ntechniques can vary significantly depending on the specific RL algorithm and environment.\\nMore recently, there has been a growing interest in meta-learning approaches for improving the\\nadaptability of RL agents [8, 9]. These methods aim to learn a general-purpose learning algorithm\\nthat can quickly adapt to new tasks or environments. While meta-learning techniques have shown\\npromising results in certain scenarios, they often require significant computational resources for\\ntraining the meta-learner. Furthermore, the performance of meta-learning methods can be sensitive to\\nthe choice of meta-learning algorithm and the design of the meta-training process.\\nOur proposed plasticity injection framework differs from these existing approaches in several key\\naspects. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for identifying the onset and severity of plasticity\\nloss, allowing for proactive intervention. Second, it mitigates plasticity loss without requiring\\nsignificant architectural modifications or hyperparameter tuning. Third, it dynamically expands\\nnetwork capacity only when necessary, leading to improved computational efficiency. These features\\nmake plasticity injection a more efficient and adaptable solution compared to existing methods for\\naddressing plasticity loss in RL. The unique combination of diagnostic capabilities, targeted plasticity\\nadjustments, and adaptive capacity allocation distinguishes our approach from previous work.\\nFinally, the focus on understanding the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss through a novel\\ndiagnostic metric provides valuable insights that can inform the development of future methods.\\n2This deeper understanding of the causes of plasticity loss is crucial for designing more robust and\\nadaptable RL agents. Our work contributes to the broader field of continual learning and aims to\\nadvance the state-of-the-art in building truly resilient and long-lasting RL agents.\\n3 Methodology\\nOur proposed approach, termed \"plasticity injection,\" addresses plasticity loss in deep reinforcement\\nlearning agents through a three-pronged strategy: diagnosis, mitigation, and adaptive capacity\\nexpansion. The core of our methodology lies in a novel diagnostic metric that continuously monitors\\nthe agent’s learning trajectory and adaptability. This metric, detailed in Section 3, quantifies the\\nagent’s ability to respond to environmental changes, providing a sensitive indicator of plasticity loss\\nonset and severity. Early detection is crucial, allowing for proactive intervention before significant\\nperformance degradation occurs. The computational efficiency of this metric is paramount, ensuring\\nminimal disruption to the overall training process. We employ a sliding window approach to smooth\\nout short-term fluctuations in the metric, enhancing its robustness to noise and providing a more\\nreliable signal for intervention. The threshold for triggering plasticity injection is dynamically\\nadjusted based on the agent’s performance history, adapting to the inherent variability of different\\nRL environments. This adaptive thresholding prevents premature or unnecessary interventions,\\noptimizing the efficiency of our approach. The diagnostic framework forms the foundation upon\\nwhich the subsequent mitigation and capacity expansion strategies are built.\\nThe mitigation strategy focuses on targeted adjustments to the network’s learning dynamics, rather\\nthan wholesale architectural changes. Instead of adding new parameters, we selectively modify\\nthe learning rates of specific neurons or layers identified by the diagnostic framework as being\\nmost affected by plasticity loss. This targeted approach minimizes computational overhead while\\npreserving the integrity of the learned policy. We employ a gradient-based optimization technique to\\ndetermine the optimal learning rate adjustments for each identified neuron or layer. This optimization\\nprocess considers both the current learning progress and the agent’s overall performance, ensuring\\nthat the adjustments are both effective and stable. The learning rate adjustments are implemented\\nusing a dynamic scaling factor, which is continuously updated based on the diagnostic metric. This\\ndynamic scaling ensures that the plasticity injection mechanism adapts to the evolving needs of the\\nagent throughout the training process. The specific algorithm for determining the optimal learning\\nrate adjustments is detailed in Appendix A.\\nAdaptive capacity expansion is triggered only when the diagnostic metric indicates a significant\\nand persistent decline in the agent’s adaptability, despite the mitigation efforts. This ensures that\\ncomputational resources are not wasted on unnecessary capacity increases during periods of stable\\nperformance. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network,\\nstrategically placed based on the information provided by the diagnostic framework. The addition of\\nnew neurons or layers is guided by a principled approach that minimizes disruption to the existing\\nnetwork architecture and ensures seamless integration of the new capacity. We employ a gradual\\nexpansion strategy, adding a small number of neurons or layers at a time, to avoid sudden changes\\nthat could destabilize the training process. The specific architecture of the added neurons or layers\\nis determined based on the nature of the plasticity loss detected by the diagnostic framework. This\\ntargeted expansion ensures that the added capacity is effectively utilized to address the specific\\nchallenges posed by plasticity loss.\\nThe effectiveness of plasticity injection is rigorously evaluated across a diverse set of challenging\\nRL benchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. These\\nbenchmarks are carefully selected to represent a wide range of complexities and challenges commonly\\nencountered in real-world applications. We compare the performance of our approach against several\\nstate-of-the-art baselines, including methods based on architectural modifications, regularization tech-\\nniques, and meta-learning. The results, presented in Section 5, demonstrate a consistent improvement\\nin long-term performance and learning stability across all benchmarks. Furthermore, the diagnostic\\ncomponent of plasticity injection provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of\\nplasticity loss, offering a deeper understanding of this critical issue in RL. The detailed experimental\\nsetup and results are presented in Appendix B.\\nOur methodology contributes significantly to the field of continual learning by providing a novel and\\nefficient approach to address plasticity loss in RL agents. The combination of proactive diagnosis,\\n3targeted mitigation, and adaptive capacity expansion allows for a robust and adaptable system that\\nmaintains high performance over extended periods.

       "  'file_content': 'Do You See What I Mean? Visual Resolution of\\nLinguistic Ambiguities\\nAbstract\\nUnderstanding language goes hand in hand with the ability to integrate com-\\nplex contextual information obtained via perception. We present a novel task for\\ngrounded language understanding: disambiguating a sentence given a visual scene\\nwhich depicts one of the possible interpretations of that sentence. To this end, we\\nintroduce a new multimodal corpus containing ambiguous sentences, representing\\na wide range of syntactic, semantic and discourse ambiguities, coupled with videos\\nthat visualize the different interpretations for each sentence. We address this task\\nby extending a vision model which determines if a sentence is depicted by a video.\\nWe demonstrate how such a model can be adjusted to recognize different interpre-\\ntations of the same underlying sentence, allowing to disambiguate sentences in a\\nunified fashion across the different ambiguity types.\\n1 Introduction\\nAmbiguity is one of the defining characteristics of human languages, and language understanding\\ncrucially relies on the ability to obtain unambiguous representations of linguistic content. While\\nsome ambiguities can be resolved using intra-linguistic contextual cues, the disambiguation of many\\nlinguistic constructions requires integration of world knowledge and perceptual information obtained\\nfrom other modalities.\\nWe focus on the problem of grounding language in the visual modality, and introduce a novel task\\nfor language understanding which requires resolving linguistic ambiguities by utilizing the visual\\ncontext in which the linguistic content is expressed. This type of inference is frequently called for in\\nhuman communication that occurs in a visual environment, and is crucial for language acquisition,\\nwhen much of the linguistic content refers to the visual surroundings of the child.\\nOur task is also fundamental to the problem of grounding vision in language, by focusing on\\nphenomena of linguistic ambiguity, which are prevalent in language, but typically overlooked when\\nusing language as a medium for expressing understanding of visual content. Due to such ambiguities,\\na superficially appropriate description of a visual scene may in fact not be sufficient for demonstrating\\na correct understanding of the relevant visual content. Our task addresses this issue by introducing a\\ndeep validation protocol for visual understanding, requiring not only providing a surface description\\nof a visual activity but also demonstrating structural understanding at the levels of syntax, semantics\\nand discourse.\\nTo enable the systematic study of visually grounded processing of ambiguous language, we create\\na new corpus, LA V A (Language and Vision Ambiguities). This corpus contains sentences with\\nlinguistic ambiguities that can only be resolved using external information. The sentences are paired\\nwith short videos that visualize different interpretations of each sentence. Our sentences encompass a\\nwide range of syntactic, semantic and dis-\\ncourse ambiguities, including ambiguous prepositional and verb phrase attachments, conjunctions,\\nlogical forms, anaphora and ellipsis. Overall, the corpus contains 237 sentences, with 2 to 3\\ninterpretations per sentence, and an average of 3.37 videos that depict visual variations of each\\nsentence interpretation, corresponding to a total of 1679 videos.Using this corpus, we address the problem of selecting the interpretation of an ambiguous sentence\\nthat matches the content of a given video. Our approach for tackling this task extends the sentence\\ntracker. The sentence tracker produces a score which determines if a sentence is depicted by a\\nvideo. This earlier work had no concept of ambiguities; it assumed that every sentence had a single\\ninterpretation. We extend this approach to represent multiple interpretations of a sentence, enabling\\nus to pick the interpretation that is most compatible with the video.\\n2 Related Work\\nPrevious language and vision studies focused on the development of multimodal word and sentence\\nrepresentations as well as methods for describing images and videos in natural language. While these\\nstudies handle important challenges in multimodal processing of language and vision, they do not\\nprovide explicit modeling of linguistic ambiguities.\\nPrevious work relating ambiguity in language to the visual modality addressed the problem of word\\nsense disambiguation. However, this work is limited to context independent interpretation of individ-\\nual words, and does not consider structure-related ambiguities. Discourse ambiguities were previously\\nstudied in work on multimodal coreference resolution. Our work expands this line of research, and\\naddresses further discourse ambiguities in the interpretation of ellipsis. More importantly, to the best\\nof our knowledge our study is the first to present a systematic treatment of syntactic and semantic\\nsentence level ambiguities in the context of language and vision.\\nThe interactions between linguistic and visual information in human sentence processing have been\\nextensively studied in psycholinguistics and cognitive psychology. A considerable fraction of this\\nwork focused on the processing of ambiguous language, providing evidence for the importance of\\nvisual information for linguistic ambiguity resolution by humans. Such information is also vital\\nduring language acquisition, when much of the linguistic content perceived by the child refers to their\\nimmediate visual environment. Over time, children develop mechanisms for grounded disambiguation\\nof language, manifested among others by the usage of iconic gestures when communicating ambigu-\\nous linguistic content. Our study leverages such insights to develop a complementary framework that\\nenables addressing the challenge of visually grounded disambiguation of language in the realm of\\nartificial intelligence.\\n3 Task\\nWe provide a concrete framework for the study of language understanding with visual context by\\nintroducing the task of grounded language disambiguation. This task requires to choose the correct\\nlinguistic representation of a sentence given a visual context depicted in a video. Specifically, provided\\nwith a sentence, n candidate interpretations of that sentence and a video that depicts the content of\\nthe sentence, one needs to choose the interpretation that corresponds to the content of the video.\\nTo illustrate this task, consider the example, where we are given the sentence “Sam approached the\\nchair with a bag” along with two different linguistic interpretations. In the first in-\\nterpretation, which corresponds to parse 1(a), Sam has the bag. In the second interpretation associated\\nwith parse 1(b), the bag is on the chair rather than with Sam. Given the visual context from figure\\n1(c), the task is to choose which interpretation is most appropriate for the sentence.\\n4 Approach Overview\\nTo address the grounded language disambiguation task, we use a compositional approach for determin-\\ning if a specific interpretation of a sentence is depicted by a video. a sentence and an accompanying\\ninterpretation encoded in first order logic, give rise to a grounded model that matches a video against\\nthe provided sentence interpretation.\\nThe model is comprised of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) which encode the semantics of words,\\nand trackers which locate objects in video frames. To represent an interpretation of a sentence, word\\nmodels are combined with trackers through a cross-product which respects the semantic representation\\nof the sentence to create a single model which recognizes that interpretation.\\n2Given a sentence, we construct an HMM based representation for each interpretation of that sentence.\\nWe then detect candidate locations for objects in every frame of the video. Together the re-\\nforestation for the sentence and the candidate object locations are combined to form a model which\\ncan determine if a given interpretation is depicted by the video. We test each interpretation and report\\nthe interpretation with highest likelihood.\\n5 Corpus\\nTo enable a systematic study of linguistic ambiguities that are grounded in vision, we compiled\\na corpus with ambiguous sentences describing visual actions. The sentences are formulated such\\nthat the correct linguistic interpretation of each sentence can only be determined using external,\\nnon-linguistic, information about the depicted activity. For example, in the sentence “Bill held the\\ngreen chair and bag”, the correct scope of “green” can only be determined by integrating additional\\ninformation about the color of the bag. This information is provided in the accompanying videos,\\nwhich visualize the possible interpretations of each sentence. Figure 2 presents the syntactic parses\\nfor this example along with frames from the respective videos. Although our videos contain visual\\nuncertainty, they are not ambiguous with respect to the linguistic interpretation they are presenting,\\nand hence a video always corresponds to a single candidate representation of a sentence.\\nThe corpus covers a wide range of well\\nknown syntactic, semantic and discourse ambiguity classes. While the ambiguities are associated\\nwith various types, different sentence interpretations always represent distinct sentence meanings,\\nand are hence encoded semantically using first order logic. For syntactic and discourse ambiguities\\nwe also provide an additional, ambiguity type specific encoding as described below.\\n• Syntax Syntactic ambiguities include Prepositional Phrase (PP) attachments, Verb Phrase\\n(VP) attachments, and ambiguities in the interpretation of conjunctions. In addition to\\nlogical forms, sentences with syntactic ambiguities are also accompanied with Context Free\\nGrammar (CFG) parses of the candidate interpretations, generated from a deterministic CFG\\nparser.\\n• Semantics The corpus addresses several classes of semantic quantification ambiguities, in\\nwhich a syntactically unambiguous sentence may correspond to different logical forms. For\\neach such sentence we provide the respective logical forms.\\n• Discourse The corpus contains two types of discourse ambiguities, Pronoun Anaphora and\\nEllipsis, offering examples comprising two sentences. In anaphora ambiguity cases, an\\nambiguous pronoun in the second sentence is given its candidate antecedents in the first\\nsentence, as well as a corresponding logical form for the meaning of the second sentence. In\\nellipsis cases, a part of the second sentence, which can constitute either the subject and the\\nverb, or the verb and the object, is omitted. We provide both interpretations of the omission\\nin the form of a single unambiguous sentence, and its logical form, which combines the\\nmeanings of the first and the second sentences.\\nTable 2 lists examples of the different ambiguity classes, along with the candidate interpretations of\\neach example.\\nThe corpus is generated using Part of Speech (POS) tag sequence templates. For each template, the\\nPOS tags are replaced with lexical items from the corpus lexicon, described in table 3, using all the\\nvisually applicable assignments. This generation process yields an overall of 237 sentences,\\nof which 213 sentences have 2 candidate interpretations, and 24 sentences have 3 interpretations.\\nTable 1 presents the corpus templates for each ambiguity class, along with the number of sentences\\ngenerated from each template.\\nThe corpus videos are filmed in an indoor environment containing background objects and pedestrians.\\nTo account for the manner of performing actions, videos are shot twice with different actors. Whenever\\napplicable, we also filmed the actions from two different directions (e.g. approach from the left,\\nand approach from the right). Finally, all videos were shot with two cameras from two different\\nview points.

Datasets aim to control for more aspects of\\nthe videos than just the main action being performed but they do not provide the range of ambiguities\\ndiscussed here. The closest dataset is that of as it controls for object appearance, color, action,\\nand direction of motion, making it more likely to be suitable for evaluating disambiguation tasks.\\nUnfortunately, that dataset was designed to avoid ambiguities, and therefore is not suitable for\\nevaluating the work described here.\\n6 Model\\nTo perform the disambiguation task, we extend the sentence recognition model which represents\\nsentences as compositions of words. Given a sentence, its first order logic interpretation and a\\nvideo, our model produces a score which determines if the sentence is depicted by the video. It\\nsimultaneously tracks the participants in the events described by the sentence while recognizing the\\nevents themselves. This al-\\nlows it to be flexible in the presence of noise by integrating top-down information from the sentence\\nwith bottom-up information from object and property detectors. Each word in the query sentence is\\nrepresented by an HMM, which recognizes tracks (i.e. paths of detections in a video for a specific\\nobject) that satisfy the semantics of the given word. In essence, this model can be described as having\\ntwo layers, one in which object tracking occurs and one in which words observe tracks and filter\\ntracks that do not satisfy the word constraints.\\nGiven a sentence interpretation, we construct a sentence-specific model which recognizes if a video\\ndepicts the sentence as follows. Each predicate in the first order logic formula has a corresponding\\nHMM, which can recognize if that predicate is true of a video given its arguments. Each variable has\\na corresponding tracker which attempts to physically locate the bounding box corresponding to that\\nvariable in each frame of a\\nvideo. This creates a bipartite graph: HMMs that represent predicates are connected to trackers that\\nrepresent variables. The trackers themselves are similar to the HMMs, in that they comprise a lattice\\nof potential bounding boxes in every frame. To construct a joint model for a sentence interpretation,\\nwe take the cross product of HMMs and trackers, taking only those cross products dictated by the\\nstructure of the formula corresponding to the desired interpretation. Given a video, we employ an\\nobject detector to generate candidate detections in each frame, construct trackers which select one of\\nthese detections in each frame, and finally construct the overall model from HMMs and trackers.\\n4Table 2: An overview of the different ambiguity types, along with examples of ambiguous sentences\\nwith their linguistic and visual interpretations. Note that similarly to semantic ambiguities, syntactic\\nand discourse ambiguities are also provided with first order logic formulas for the resulting sentence\\ninterpretations.

The structure of the formula and the fact that multiple\\npredicates often refer to the same variables is recorded by θ, a mapping between predicates and their\\narguments. The model computes the MAP estimate as:\\nfor sentences which have words that refer to at most two tracks (i.e. transitive verbs or binary\\npredicates) but is trivially extended to arbitrary arities. Figure 3 provides a visual overview of the\\nmodel as a cross-product of tracker models and word models.\\nOur model extends the approach of in several ways. First, we depart from the dependency based\\nrepresentation used in that work, and recast the model to encode first order logic formulas. Note\\nthat some complex first order logic formulas cannot be directly encoded in the model and require\\nadditional inference steps. This extension enables us to represent ambiguities in which a given\\nsentence has multiple logical interpretations for the same syntactic parse.\\nSecond, we introduce several model components which are not specific to disambiguation, but are\\nrequired to encode linguistic constructions that are present in our corpus and could not be handled by\\nthe model of. These new components are the predicate “not equal”, disjunction, and conjunction. The\\nkey addition among these components is support for the new predicate “not equal”, which enforces\\nthat two tracks, i.e. objects, are distinct from each other. For example, in the sentence “Claire and Bill\\nmoved a chair” one would want to ensure that the two movers are distinct entities. In earlier work,\\nthis was not required because the sentences tested in that work were designed to distinguish objects\\nbased on constraints rather than identity. In other words, there might have been two different people\\nbut they were distinguished in the sentence by their actions or appearance. To faithfully recognize\\nthat two actors are moving the chair in the earlier example, we must ensure that they are disjoint\\nfrom each other. In order to do this we create a new HMM for this predicate, which assigns low\\nprobability to tracks that heavily overlap, forcing the model to fit two different actors in the previous\\nexample. By combining the new first order logic based semantic representation in lieu of a syntactic\\nrepresentation with a more expressive model, we can encode the sentence interpretations required to\\nperform the disambiguation task.\\nFigure 3(left) shows an example of two different interpretations of the above discussed sentence\\n“Claire and Bill moved a chair”. Object trackers, which correspond to variables in the first order\\nlogic representation of the sentence interpretation, are shown in red. Predicates which constrain the\\npossible bindings of the trackers, corresponding to predicates in the representation of the sentence, are\\nshown in blue. Links represent the argument structure of the first order logic formula, and determine\\nthe cross products that are taken between the predicate HMMs and tracker lattices in order to form\\nthe joint model which recognizes the entire interpretation in a video.\\nThe resulting model provides a single unified formalism for representing all the ambiguities in table\\n2. Moreover, this approach can be tuned to different levels of specificity. We can create models that\\nare specific to one interpretation of a sentence or that are generic, and accept multiple interpretations\\nby eliding constraints that are not com-\\nmon between the different interpretations. This allows the model, like humans, to defer deciding on a\\nparticular interpretation or to infer that multiple interpretation of the sentence are plausible.\\n7 Experimental Results\\nWe tested the performance of the model described in the previous section on the LA V A dataset\\npresented in section 5. Each video in the dataset was pre-processed with object detectors for humans,\\nbags, chairs, and telescopes. We employed a mixture of CNN and DPM detectors, trained on held\\nout sections of our corpus. For each object class we generated proposals from both the CNN and\\n6the DPM detectors, and trained a scoring function to map both results into the same space. The\\nscoring function consisted of a sigmoid over the confidence of the detectors trained on the same held\\nout portion of the training set. As none of the disambiguation examples discussed here rely on the\\nspecific identity of the actors, we did not detect their identity. Instead, any sentence which contains\\nnames was automatically converted to one which contains arbitrary “person” labels.\\nThe sentences in our corpus have either two or three interpretations. Each interpretation has one or\\nmore associated videos where the scene was shot from a different angle, carried out either by different\\nactors, with different objects, or in different directions of motion. For each sentence-video pair, we\\nperformed a 1-out-of-2 or 1-out-of-3 classification task to determine which of the interpretations of\\nthe corresponding sentence best fits that video. Overall chance performance on our dataset is 49.04%,\\nslightly lower than 50% due to the 1out-of-3 classification examples.\\nThe model presented here achieved an accuracy of 75.36% over the entire corpus averaged across\\nall error categories. This demonstrates that the model is largely capable of capturing the underlying\\ntask and that similar compositional crossmodal models may do the same. For each of the 3 major\\nambiguity classes we had an accuracy of 84.26% for syntactic ambiguities, 72.28% for semantic\\nambiguities, and 64.44% for discourse ambiguities.\\nThe most significant source of model failures are poor object detections. Objects are often rotated\\nand presented at angles that are difficult to recognize. Certain object classes like the telescope\\nare much more difficult to recognize due to their small size and the fact that hands tend to largely\\nocclude them. This accounts for the degraded performance of the semantic ambiguities relative to the\\nsyntactic ambiguities, as many more semantic ambiguities involved the telescope. Object detector\\nperformance is similarly responsible for the lower performance of the discourse ambiguities which\\nrelied much more on the accuracy of the person detector as many sentences involve only people\\ninteracting with each other without any additional objects. This degrades performance by removing a\\nhelpful constraint for inference, according to which people tend to be close to the objects they are\\nmanipulating. In addition, these sentences introduced more visual uncertainty as they often involved\\nthree actors.\\nThe remaining errors are due to the event models. HMMs can fixate on short sequences of events\\nwhich seem as if they are part of an action, but in fact are just noise or the prefix of another action.\\nIdeally, one would want an event model which has a global view of the action, if an object went up\\nfrom the beginning to the end of the video while a person was holding it, it’s likely that the object was\\nbeing picked up. The event models used here cannot enforce this constraint, they merely assert that\\nthe object was moving up for some number of frames; an event which can happen due to noise in the\\nobject detectors. Enforcing such local constraints instead of the global constraint of the motion of the\\nobject over the video makes joint tracking and event recognition tractable in the framework presented\\nhere but can lead to errors. Finding models which strike a better balance between local information\\nand global constraints while maintaining tractable inference remains an area of future work.\\n8 Conclusion\\nWe present a novel framework for studying ambiguous utterances expressed in a visual context. In\\nparticular, we formulate a new task for resolving structural ambiguities using visual signal. This is a\\nfundamental task for humans, involving complex cognitive processing, and is a key challenge for\\nlanguage acquisition during childhood. We release a multimodal corpus that enables to address this\\ntask, as well as support further investigation of ambiguity related phenomena in visually grounded\\nlanguage processing. Finally, we\\npresent a unified approach for resolving ambiguous descriptions of videos, achieving good perfor-\\nmance on our corpus.\\nWhile our current investigation focuses on structural inference, we intend to extend this line of work\\nto learning scenarios, in which the agent has to deduce the meaning of words and sentences from\\nstructurally ambiguous input. Furthermore, our framework can be beneficial for image and video\\nretrieval applications in which the query is expressed in natural language. Given an ambiguous query,\\nour approach will enable matching and clustering the retrieved results according to the different query\\ninterpretations.\\n7'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Large Vocabulary Handling in Recurrent Neural\\nNetworks Enhanced by Positional Encoding\\nAbstract\\nThis research presents a counterintuitive discovery: positional encoding, a high-\\ndimensional representation of time indices on input data, improves the learning\\ncapabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Although positional encoding is\\nwidely recognized for complementing Transformer neural networks by enabling\\nthem to process data order, its application to RNNs seems unnecessary because\\nRNNs inherently encode temporal information. However, our analysis using syn-\\nthetic benchmarks shows that combining positional encoding with RNNs offers\\nadvantages, especially when dealing with extensive vocabularies that include low-\\nfrequency tokens. Further investigation reveals that these infrequent tokens cause\\ninstability in the gradients of standard RNNs, and positional encoding helps to miti-\\ngate this instability. These findings highlight a new function of positional encoding\\nbeyond its well-known role as a timekeeping mechanism for Transformers.\\n1 Introduction\\nSince their introduction, Transformer neural networks have become the preferred method for pro-\\ncessing and generating time series data, surpassing traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A\\nsignificant difference between these models is their handling of temporal information, that is, the\\nsequence of data points or tokens. RNNs process temporal information by adjusting their internal\\nstate based on new inputs and their existing state. Conversely, Transformers lack an intrinsic mecha-\\nnism for understanding data sequence order and, therefore, depend on an external system known as\\npositional encoding to keep track of time.\\nPositional encoding represents time indices in a high-dimensional format. A common method\\ninvolves using sinusoidal waves of predetermined frequencies. This method marks input tokens by\\nadding or appending these vectors to the input embeddings. Unlike RNNs, positional encoding’s time\\nrepresentation remains constant regardless of input values until processed by a network.\\nAlthough positional encoding is often viewed as a way to represent time that can replace RNNs when\\nused with Transformers, it is not incompatible with RNNs. Inputs to RNNs can be augmented with\\nposition-encoding vectors. Autonomous activities in biological neurons, such as oscillations, are\\nbelieved to be important for time perception and other perceptual processes, as well as motor control.\\nThis study, therefore, investigates the effects of adding positional encoding to the inputs of RNNs,\\nusing synthetic benchmarks. The results demonstrate that positional encoding helps RNNs manage a\\nmore extensive range of discrete inputs, or a larger vocabulary, compared to those without positional\\nencoding.\\nThe key contributions of this research are outlined below:\\n• It illustrates the challenges faced when training RNNs on large vocabularies using carefully\\ndesigned benchmark tasks, a problem that has not been widely recognized or addressed in\\nprevious research, despite its potential impact on practical applications.\\n.• It explains that the difficulties in training RNNs with extensive vocabularies are due to\\ngradient instability caused by infrequent tokens, which inevitably occur as vocabulary size\\nincreases.\\n• It introduces a novel use of positional encoding, beyond its typical role in timing for\\nTransformers, by integrating it with RNNs. It shows that positional encoding helps alleviate\\nissues related to large vocabularies by stabilizing RNN gradients against the disruptions\\ncaused by infrequent tokens.\\n2 Related Studies\\n2.1 Theoretical and Empirical Computational Power of (Vanilla) RNNs\\nMathematically, RNNs are recognized as being Turing-complete, capable of simulating Turing\\nmachines if their weights are infinitely precise and perfectly tuned. In practice, however, RNN\\nweights are limited by finite precision and the need to optimize based on a finite set of observations.\\nThese constraints impose practical limitations on the capabilities of RNNs. For instance, empirical\\nRNNs cannot store an infinite number of observations in their memory, and the memorized information\\ntends to degrade over time.\\nMore recently, research into extending memory retention has explored continuous-time models.\\nInstead of modifying a latent state in discrete-time steps, these models use a linear combination\\nof orthogonal polynomials in a continuous-time domain to approximate the input history. The\\ncoefficients of these polynomials provide a finite-dimensional representation of the input sequence,\\nknown as the High-Order Polynomial Projection Operator (HiPPO), and the dynamics of these\\ncoefficients can be described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This concept has been\\nfurther developed into neural state-space models by replacing the fixed state matrix in the ODE\\nwith a learnable one, constrained to a diagonal structure plus a row-rank matrix. With additional\\nenhancements, the latest state-space models have shown language modeling performance that rivals\\nTransformer-based models.\\n2.2 Positional Encoding\\nPositional encoding serves as a high-dimensional representation of the temporal structures present\\nin input data. This method is particularly crucial for Transformers, which, unlike RNNs, do not\\ninherently capture the order of inputs. Therefore, input tokens to a Transformer are \"time-stamped\"\\nby adding or concatenating a position-encoding vector.\\nIn the initial implementation of the Transformer, token positions were represented using sinusoidal\\nwaves of various predefined frequencies. Although this method is effective for a wide range of tasks,\\nresearchers have explored other encoding schemes as well. For instance, the well-known BERT\\npretraining for natural language processing used learnable embeddings to indicate token positions.\\nSome studies have suggested that combining sinusoidal and learnable encodings can enhance model\\nperformance. Another approach is to encode the distance between tokens instead of the time elapsed\\nfrom the sequence’s beginning.\\nBeyond Transformers, positional encoding is used to indicate elapsed time in diffusion processes.\\nIts effectiveness is not limited to temporal information; studies on three-dimensional mesh and\\npoint-cloud modeling have shown that sinusoidal transformation of spatial data outperforms raw\\ncoordinate representation.\\nDespite its widespread use across various areas of machine learning, the application of positional\\nencoding to pure RNNs has been largely unexplored. To the author’s knowledge, only a few studies\\nhave investigated position-encoded RNNs. The time index in time series data has rarely been directly\\nused by RNNs, likely due to perceived redundancy alongside RNN functionalities.\\n23 Methods\\n3.1 Task\\nThe impact of positional encoding on RNNs was examined using a reverse-ordering task. In this task,\\nRNNs were trained to reconstruct a sequence of random integers in reverse order (e.g., given 8, 29, 2,\\n11, the output should be 11, 2, 29, 8).\\n3.2 Model Architecture\\nThis study’s investigations were based on single-layer gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term\\nmemory (LSTM) networks, and a neural state-space model, S4D. Each integer in the input sequences\\nwas first embedded, concatenated with its positional encoding, and then fed into the RNN or S4D.\\nAfter processing the entire input sequence, the network received a command to produce the output,\\nrepresented by a time-invariant learnable vector. The outputs from the RNN or S4D module were\\nlinearly projected into classification logits, and the cross-entropy loss against the target sequence was\\nused to optimize the entire network. Model predictions during testing were determined by the argmax\\nof these logits for each time step.\\nThe canonical sinusoidal positional encoding used for Transformers was adopted in this study.\\nSpecifically, each time step t was encoded by a Dpos-dimensional vector, (P Et,1, ..., P Et,Dpos)T ,\\ndefined as follows:\\nP Et,2i := sin\\n \\nt − 1\\n10000\\n2(i−1)\\nDpos\\n!\\n(1)\\nP Et,2i+1 := cos\\n \\nt − 1\\n10000\\n2(i−1)\\nDpos\\n!\\n(2)\\nFor learning stability, the positional encoding was normalized by dividing it by\\np\\nDpos/2, ensuring\\nthe encoding vectors had a unit L2-norm. The time step t incremented throughout both input and\\noutput phases (i.e., t = 1, ..., L, L+ 1, ...,2L, where L is the input length), without any hard-coded\\nlink between input and output positions.\\n3.3 Implementation Details\\nAcross the experiments, the dimensionality of the hidden layer of the RNNs was set to 512. The\\nembedding of the input integers and the memory cell of the LSTM also had the same dimensionality\\nof 512. Similarly, the hidden dimensionality of S4D was set to 512, while its state size (or the order\\nof the Legendre polynomials) was maintained at the default value of 64.\\nThe models were trained for 300,000 iterations using the Adam optimizer with parameters (β1, β2) :=\\n(0.9, 0.999) and no weight decay. The learning rate was linearly warmed up from 0.0 to 0.001 for the\\nfirst 1,000 iterations, and then annealed according to the cosine schedule. The batch size was 512.\\nAll experiments were implemented in PyTorch (ver. 2.1.1).\\n4 Results\\n4.1 Key Findings\\nPositional encoding improved the ability of RNNs to handle a larger vocabulary in the reverse-ordering\\ntask. The position-encoded GRU and LSTM successfully reversed input sequences of 64 integers\\ndrawn uniformly at random from vocabularies of size 32-256 and 256-16,384, respectively, achieving\\ntoken-wise accuracy above 95%. In contrast, the performance of the vanilla models without positional\\nencoding degraded as the vocabulary size increased. Similarly, positional encoding enhanced the\\ncapacity of S4D to handle large vocabularies. These improvements are also evident in the reduced\\nsequence-wise reconstruction errors, measured by the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. Neither extra\\ntraining iterations nor greater batch sizes improved the performance of the vanilla models.\\n34.2 Frequency Matters\\nThe most apparent consequence of the increased vocabulary size was the reduced chance of observing\\nindividual vocabulary items. Accordingly, additional experiments were conducted with non-uniformly\\ndistributed tokens to investigate the relation between their frequency and RNN performance. Specif-\\nically, the input vocabulary was evenly divided into Frequent and Rare groups, and the Frequent\\ntokens had three times the probability of the Rare tokens.\\nThe training data consisted of 64 independent samples from this dual-frequency vocabulary. By\\ncontrast, the test data were systematically constructed so that each sequence included a single\\n\"target\" token (Frequent/Rare) whose retrieval was evaluated for accuracy assessment, along with\\n63 \"disturbants\" that were either all Frequent or all Rare. The experiment revealed that it was the\\ndisturbant tokens whose frequency significantly impacted the performance of the vanilla RNNs and\\nS4D. On the one hand, the Rare targets were successfully retrieved as long as they were surrounded\\nby the Frequent disturbants. On the other hand, the vanilla GRU struggled to recover the Frequent\\ntargets when the other input tokens were filled with the Rare disturbants. The LSTM performance was\\nalso degraded, especially when the targets were positioned in the first quarter of the input sequence (1\\n≤ t ≤ 16). Similarly, the Rare disturbants were detrimental to the S4D; unlike the RNNs, however,\\nthe accuracy was worst when the targets were located in the middle of the input sequences (17 ≤ t ≤\\n32).\\nIn contrast, the position-encoded RNNs exhibited robustness to the frequency of the target and\\ndisturbant tokens. They achieved nearly perfect accuracies in most cases, except when the GRU\\nprocessed the fully Rare data whose target was located in the first half of the sequence (1 ≤ t ≤\\n32). Likewise, positional encoding enhanced the resilience of the S4D against the influence of Rare\\ndisturbants.\\n4.3 Analysis of Gradient Stability\\nTo delve deeper into the influence of token frequency on RNN performance, the gradients of the\\nRNN latent states were scrutinized. In the analysis, pairs of input sequences were processed by the\\nRNNs trained on the dual-frequency vocabulary (comprising Frequent and Rare items). Each pair\\nof sequences shared the same initial token (t = 1; \"target\") but varied in the subsequent tokens (2\\n≤ t ≤ L; \"disturbants\"). Then, gradients were computed for the distant mapping between the first\\nand last updated states (i.e., at time t = 1 and 2L) of the RNNs using backpropagation through time.\\nThe stability of RNN learning was assessed by measuring the dot-product similarity of the gradients\\nbetween the paired input sequences (after normalization over output dimensions).\\nFormally, the paired input sequences, denoted as A and B, established two distinct, but ideally similar\\nmappings, f(A) and f(B), from the first to the last latent state of the RNNs (˜h(s)\\n2L = f(s)(˜z1), where\\ns ∈ {A, B}). The gradient stability of the RNNs was defined by the dot-product similarities between\\nthe normalized gradients of these paired mappings:\\nStability(A, B) :=\\nDX\\ni=1\\n⟨α(A)\\ni ∇f(A)\\ni (˜z1), α(B)\\ni ∇f(B)\\ni (˜z1)⟩ =\\nDX\\ni=1\\nα(A)\\ni α(B)\\ni\\n \\n∂h(A)\\n2L,i\\n∂z1,j\\n·\\n∂h(B)\\n2L,i\\n∂z1,j\\n!\\n(1)\\nwhere the coefficients α(s)\\ni normalized the raw gradients ∇f(s)\\ni (˜z1) over the output dimensions\\ni := 1, ..., D:\\nα(s)\\ni :=\\nvuuut\\n2DX\\nj=1\\n \\n∂h(s)\\n2L,i\\n∂z1,j\\n!2,vuuut\\nDX\\nk=1\\n2DX\\nj=1\\n \\n∂h(s)\\n2L,k\\n∂z1,j\\n!2\\n(2)\\nMonitoring the gradients at training checkpoints revealed that Rare disturbants destabilize the learning\\nof vanilla RNNs. The similarity of the paired gradients decreased gradually (GRU) or rapidly (LSTM)\\nwhen the networks were exposed to the Rare disturbants. Positional encoding endowed the RNNs\\nwith robustness to these RARE disturbants. Both the GRU and LSTM maintained the high similarity\\nof the paired gradients across the different target/disturbant conditions. By contrast, the impact of\\npositional encoding on the gradient stability of the S4D was marginal; unlike the RNNs, the vanilla\\nS4D was highly stable by itself against Rare disturbants throughout the training, even though there\\n4was a visible relative destabilization due to Rare disturbants compared to Frequent disturbants in the\\nearly stages of training, as well as an observable improvement by positional encoding.\\n5 Discussion\\n5.1 Difficulties in Handling a Large Vocabulary\\nThis study introduces a novel challenge in training (vanilla) RNNs: managing large vocabularies.\\nWhile the manageable vocabulary size of RNNs is a pertinent research area, crucial for empirical\\napplications like natural language processing, previous studies have primarily focused on evaluating\\nand improving the memory duration of RNNs, typically with small vocabulary sizes.\\nThis research examined RNN gradients and identified their destabilization when processing low-\\nfrequency tokens, which are necessarily included in a large vocabulary. Specifically, inputs that do\\nnot contribute to gradient-based optimization at a target time step were found to be detrimental.\\nIn general time series processing, data points carrying crucial information for specific time steps\\nbecome irrelevant otherwise. Consequently, each token exhibits a dual nature—both crucial and\\nnoisy—throughout the task. Processing rare tokens is particularly challenging, presumably because\\nthey are irrelevant most of the time while making a large impact on learning due to their greater loss,\\ncompensating for fewer learning opportunities. Dealing with such \"unignorable noise\" presents a\\npervasive challenge for RNNs.\\n5.2 Functionality of Positional Encoding beyond the Timekeeper for Transformers\\nAlthough low-frequency tokens destabilize the gradient-based learning of RNNs, this study also\\ndiscovered that positional encoding can alleviate this issue. This enhancement of RNNs via positional\\nencoding is noteworthy because RNNs were specifically designed to process time series data on\\ntheir own. Unlike Transformers, they are presumed to function without relying on an \"external\\nclock\". Consequently, position-encoded RNNs have remained largely unexplored. The findings of\\nthe present study—namely, the improvement in the manageable vocabulary size due to enhanced\\ngradient stability—broaden the currently limited understanding of the impact of positional encoding\\non RNNs.\\nAdditionally, the results of this study shed new light on the utility of positional encoding. While\\npositional encoding has been viewed as nothing more than input timestamps for Transformers, the\\npresent study demonstrated its efficacy in stabilizing the gradients of RNNs against disruption by\\nlow-frequency tokens. This novel functionality of positional encoding would not have been visible in\\nTransformer studies, as the model can dynamically adjust the relevance of input tokens through their\\nattention mechanism, thus inherently mitigating the impact of disturbant tokens.\\n5.3 Limitations and Future Directions\\nA primary unresolved question in this study pertains to the mechanism behind the gradient stabilization\\nby positional encoding. All the findings here are based on experimental investigations, lacking\\nrigorous mathematical explanations for how and why the gradients of RNNs are destabilized by\\ninfrequent tokens and stabilized by positional encoding. Moreover, the present study primarily focused\\non the canonical implementation of sinusoidal positional encoding designed for Transformers, leaving\\nopen which parameters of the sinusoidal waves (i.e., frequencies and phases) are critical for gradient\\nstabilization. Future research may broaden its scope to encompass more general forms of positional\\nencoding, such as wavelets and non-periodic signals.\\nMoreover, the analysis of gradient stability did not fully address the enhanced performance of\\nthe position-encoded state-space model (S4D). In terms of accuracy, the positioned-encoded S4D\\nexhibited greater robustness to infrequent tokens compared to the vanilla model, resembling the\\nbehavior observed in RNNs. However, the gradients of the vanilla S4D were too stable to account for\\nthis decline in performance. This leaves open the question of how positional encoding influences\\ngradient-based learning of state-space models. Additionally, future studies may investigate a broader\\nrange of state-space models to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between\\npositional encoding and these models.\\n5In addition to these scientifically oriented questions, future studies could also address practical\\napplications of position-encoded RNNs and neural state-space models. Although positional encoding\\nenhanced model performance across different synthetic tasks, the extent of this enhancement is task-\\ndependent. Thus, positional encoding is not a panacea for arbitrary tasks, and further investigations\\nare necessary to determine when it is effective.\\n6 Appendix\\n6.1 Other Tasks\\nThis section demonstrates the effectiveness of positional encoding on RNNs across different tasks,\\nbesides the reverse ordering task discussed in the main text.\\n6.1.1 Reverse-Ordering + Delayed-Addition\\nThis section reports the performance of position-encoded RNNs on a more complicated, combinatorial\\ntask than the reverse ordering of input sequences. Extending the reverse-ordering task, the models\\nreceived additional random input integers during the output phase, and added each of them to the\\ncorresponding token in the reverse-ordered input sequence (modulo the vocabulary size, so that the\\noutput range was bounded). This task was too challenging to GRUs—even after reducing the input\\nlength to L = 16—so only the results from LSTMs are reported below. Also, the network was trained\\nfor 600,000 iterations (i.e., twice longer than the other tasks) for ensuring the convergence. The other\\nconditions/hyperparameters were the same as reported in the main text. Consequently, positional\\nencoding improved the model performance as the vocabulary size grew from 896 to 1088.\\n6.1.2 Sorting\\nIn the reverse ordering task, the order of input integers was important information for accomplishing\\nthe task. Thus, positional encoding may play its originally intended role in encoding the temporal\\ninformation.\\nThis section reports the effectiveness of positional encoding for a task in which the order of input\\nobservations was completely irrelevant; the learning objective was to simply sort the input integers in\\ntheir inherent ascending order (e.g. 8, 29, 2, 11 -> 2, 8, 11, 29). The input integers were uniformly\\nrandomly sampled with replacement, allowing for ties in the sorting process.\\nAs a result, positional encoding also proved effective for RNNs to handle a larger vocabulary in the\\nsorting task, though the improvement remained marginal compared to the reverse-ordering task.\\n6.1.3 Predecessor Query\\nFinally, this section presents benchmark results for the predecessor-query task. The network first\\nreceived a sequence of non-repeating random integers,x1, ..., xL. Subsequently, one of the non-initial\\ninput integers, xtquery (2 ≤ tquery ≤ L), was randomly selected and reintroduced to the network\\nat time t = L + 1. The learning objective is to return the predecessor of the reviewed integer (=\\nxtquery−1). The predecessor-query task evaluates the capacity of RNNs to integrate information\\nregarding both the order and content of input sequences.\\nAs in the reverse-ordering + delayed-addition task, the input sequence was reduced to L = 16 due\\nto the complexity of the task, and the experiment focused on the LSTM. The number of training\\niterations was maintained at 300,000. Similar to the other benchmarks, positional encoding improved\\nthe LSTM’s capacity to manage the larger vocabularies.\\n6.2 Robustness to Variations in Input Length\\nSo far, all the tasks were experimented using fixed-length inputs (L = 64). One might wonder if\\npositional encoding is exceptionally effective under this setting, informing RNNs with the exact\\ntiming when each input token should be returned as the output. Thus, it remains unclear whether\\nor not position-encoded RNNs can also handle a larger vocabulary even when the input length is\\nvariable and, thus, the exact timing of the output emission is not identifiable from the positional\\nencoding attached to the inputs.\\n6To assess the robustness to variations in the input length, an additional experiment was conducted on\\nthe LSTM, with the input length varied between 32 and 64. In this setup, the maximum input length\\n(= 64) covers the entirety of the shortest input sequence plus its reversed reconstruction (= 32 + 32).\\nConsequently, the positional encoding per se cannot even distinguish the input vs. output phases at t\\n= 33, ..., 64. The vocabulary size was set to 16,384.\\nAs a result, the positional encoding still improved the LSTM’s performance on the reverse-ordering\\ntask against the perturbations in the input length. This result suggests that the effectiveness of the\\npositional encoding for RNNs is not limited to strictly scheduled tasks.\\n6.3 Effects of Additional Parameters in Position-Encoded RNNs\\nThe concatenation of positional encoding with input embeddings inflates the number of learnable\\nparameters in the input-to-hidden projection weights. This additional parameterization per se does\\nnot influence the learning of the input embeddings, and therefore does not elucidate the enhanced\\nperformance of position-encoded RNNs. This section substantiates this argument by equalizing the\\nnumber of learnable parameters between the vanilla and position-encoded models.\\nSpecifically, the equalization was achieved by concatenating two identical copies of the input\\nembeddings and feeding them to the LSTM. This configuration—henceforth termed \"double\\nvanilla\"—effectively doubled the size of the input- to-hidden weight for each gate in the LSTM,\\naligning it with that of the position-encoded LSTM, while maintaining all other parameters, including\\nthe dimensionality of the (non-repeated) input embeddings.\\nAs illustrated, the double vanilla LSTM did not yield any improvements in the reverse-ordering or\\nsort- ing tasks. These results affirm that the reported enhancement of RNNs is not merely attributable\\nto the additional parameterization associated with the positional encoding.\\n6.4 Alternative Implementations of Positional Encoding\\nWhile this study implemented positional encoding by sinusoidal waves, there are alternative imple-\\nmentations proposed in the previous studies. For instance, the BERT-based models typically encode\\neach token position by a learnable embedding. Moreover, the original study of Transformer pointed\\nout that even random vectors can function as positional encoding.\\nAccordingly, these two alternative forms of positional encoding were tested on the LSTM performing\\nthe reverse- ordering task. The random position-encoding vectors were uniformly and independently\\nsampled from the (512 1)- dimensional hypersphere. The learnable embeddings were implemented\\nusing the canonical embedding module of PyTorch (torch.nn.Embedding). The input length and\\nvocabulary size were set to 64 and 16,384 respectively. Both the random vectors and learnable\\nembeddings improved the performance of LSTM.\\nAmong the different implementations of positional encoding, the sinusoidal encoding outperformed\\nthe two alterna- tives. The advantage of the sinusoidal encoding became more apparent when the input\\nlength was variable between 32 and 64; the sinusoidal encoding was more robust to the variations in\\nthe input length than the others.\\n6.5 Language Modeling\\nThis section reports benchmark results for the language modeling task. Single-layer LSTMs with\\nand without sinusoidal positional encoding were trained and tested on the WikiText-103 dataset.\\nDue to constraints in computational resources, the vocabulary was reduced from the original size of\\n267,735 to 32,768 by retokenizing the raw data using SentencePiece. The headings were removed,\\nand the main text was segmented by paragraphs (separated by the line break). Additionally, only the\\nfirst 1024 tokens of each paragraph were utilized for training and testing, ensuring that the absolute\\npositional encoding always aligned with the beginning of each paragraph. The hyperparameters were\\nconfigured as specified in §3.3.\\nAs illustrated, positional encoding proved effective only for marginally faster learning during the\\ninitial phase of training. The difference diminished around 10,000/30,000 iterations, and the test\\nperplexities of the position-encoded model were inferior to those of the vanilla model.\\n7Table 1: Test perplexities on the WikiText-103 dataset.

       "  'file_content': 'DISCOSENSE: Commonsense Reasoning with\\nDiscourse Connectives\\nAbstract\\nWe present DISCOSENSE, a benchmark for commonsense reasoning via un-\\nderstanding a wide variety of discourse connectives. We generate compelling\\ndistractors in DISCOSENSE using Conditional Adversarial Filtering, an extension\\nof Adversarial Filtering that employs conditional generation. We show that state\\nof-the-art pre-trained language models struggle to perform well on DISCOSENSE,\\nwhich makes this dataset ideal for evaluating next generation commonsense rea-\\nsoning systems.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper addresses the critical need for challenging benchmarks that can reliably target the limita-\\ntions of current pre-trained language models (LMs) in commonsense reasoning. State-of-the-art LMs\\nhave achieved or even surpassed human performance on numerous commonsense downstream tasks.\\nNevertheless, these LMs are still very far from being able to perform commonsense reasoning as well\\nas humans. Hence, the fact that they have begun to ace existing benchmarks implies that time is ripe\\nto design a new challenging benchmark that can reliably target their limitations.\\nMotivated by this observation, we present DISCOSENSE, a benchmark for performing commonsense\\nreasoning through understanding a wide variety of discourse connectives. Figure 1 shows an example\\ntaken from DISCOSENSE. As can be seen, an example is composed of a context (e.g., “Our waitress\\nwas very nice, but she kept on forgetting my stuff.”) and a discourse connective (e.g., “For example”),\\nand the goal is to choose the most plausible ending out of four options. If we ignore the discourse\\nconnective, then all four options may\\nOur waitress was very nice, but she kept on forgetting my stuff. For example\\na) When I ordered the garlic shrimp, she remembered to add my requested garlic butter.\\nb) She took forever to bring me my beer and fries.\\nc) When I told her I wanted to use the free breakfast that was available she was not pleased.\\nd) For some customers, this is fine.\\nFigure 1: Example on commonsense reasoning with discourse connectives. The correct (i.e., most\\nplausible) option is boldfaced.\\nseem plausible because we do not know what the writer’s intent is. Once we consider both the context\\nand the discourse connective, then it is clear that only option b) is plausible. The reason is that “For\\nexample” signals an EXEMPLIFICATION relation between its arguments, and what follows the\\ndiscourse connective is expected to be an example of the waitress keeping on forgetting the writer’s\\nstuff. Using commonsense knowledge, we know that (1) “my beer and fries” is an example of “my\\nstuff”, and (2) her taking forever to bring the writer stuff implies she kept on forgetting his/her stuff.\\nWhat if we replace “For example” with “However” in the example? Since “However” signals a\\nCONTRAST relation, options a) and d) both seem viable. Specifically, option a) describes a situation\\nin which she did not forget the writer’s stuff. While option d), unlike option a), does not describeany example that signals a contrast, one may infer a contrast between option d) and the context:\\nbeing forgetful is fine for some customers. Nevertheless, option a) is arguably more plausible than\\noption d) and should be chosen. The reason is that for d) to be sensible, one needs to assume that her\\nforgetting the writer’s stuff implies that she is in general forgetful. Without this assumption, it may\\nbe strange for other customers to have an opinion on her forgetting the writer’s stuff. In general, the\\nmost plausible option is the option that makes the smallest number of assumptions, and/or is the most\\ncoherent given the context and the discourse connective. Considering the commonsense knowledge\\nand the reasoning involved, it should not be difficult to see that this task is challenging.\\nOur contributions are four-fold. First, we create DISCOSENSE, a new dataset aimed at testing\\nLMs’ commonsense reasoning capabilities through discourse connectives. Second, we employ a\\ncontrolled text generation based adversarial filtering approach to generate compelling negatives.\\nThird, we establish baseline results on DISCOSENSE with numerous state-of-the-art discriminator\\nmodels and show that they struggle to perform well on DISCOSENSE, which makes our dataset\\nan ideal benchmark for next-generation commonsense reasoning systems. Finally, we show the\\nefficacy of using DISCOSENSE as a transfer learning resource through sequential fine-tuning of\\nLMs on DISCOSENSE followed by HELLASW AG and achieve near state-of-the-art results on the\\nHELLASW AG test set. To stimulate work on this task, we make our code and data publicly available.\\n2 Related Work\\nIn this section, we discuss related work, focusing our discussion on the differences between DIS-\\nCOSENSE and existing commonsense reasoning benchmarks. In addition, we present an overview of\\nAdversarial Filtering, which will facilitate the introduction of the Conditional Adversarial Filtering\\nmechanism we propose in Section 3.\\nCommonsense reasoning benchmarks. SW AG and HELLASW AG are arguably the most prominent\\ncommonsense reasoning benchmarks. In SW AG, given a partial description along with four candidate\\nendings, the task is to predict the most plausible ending. The synthetic options (a.k.a. distractors)\\nare generated through a process called Adversarial Filtering (AF) (see below). HELLASW AG is an\\nextension of SWAG that seeks to eliminate artifacts in the generated endings. Unlike SWAG and\\nHELLASWAG, DISCOSENSE requires that the discourse connective be taken into account in the\\nreasoning process, thus increasing the number of inference steps and potentially the task complexity.\\nIn addition, while the examples in SWAG and HELLASWAG come primarily from ActivityNet (a\\nbenchmark focused on dense captioning of temporal events),\\nDISCOSENSE features a more diverse set of examples coming from varied domains that may only\\nbe solved with rich background knowledge.\\nThere are benchmarks that aim to test different kinds of commonsense reasoning abilities, although\\nnone of them focuses on reasoning over discourse connectives. SocialIQA, for instance, focuses on\\nsocial and emotional commonsense reasoning. ABDUCTIVE NLI focuses on abductive reasoning.\\nWINOGRANDE contains Winograd schema-inspired problems, which are essentially hard pronoun\\nresolution problems requiring world knowledge. PIQA examines physical commonsense reasoning.\\nMCTACO and TIMEDIAL focus on temporal reasoning in comprehension and dialogue formats.\\nMore closely related to DISCOSENSE are commonsense reasoning benchmarks that involve reason-\\ning with a particular kind of relations. COPA (Choice of Plausible Alternatives) focuses exclusively\\non reasoning with CAUSAL relations and involves choosing the more plausible ending out of two\\n(rather than four) options. P-MCQA focuses exclusively on reasoning with PRECONDITION rela-\\ntions: given a commonsense fact, select the precondition that make the fact possible (enabling) or\\nimpossible (disabling) out of four options. NLI, which aims to evaluate defensible inference, focuses\\nexclusively on reasoning with the STRENGTHEN/WEAKEN relations: given a premise-claim pair\\nwhere the premise supports the claim, generate a sentence that either strengthens or weakens the\\nsupport. WINOVENTI, which is composed of Winogradstyle schemas, focuses exclusively on\\nreasoning with ENTAILMENT relations: given two sentences with an entailment relation, such as\\n”Pete says the pear is delicious. The pear is ”, the goal is to fill in the blank with one of two choices\\n(e.g., ”edible”, ”inedible”). There are two key differences between these datasets and DISCOSENSE.\\nFirst, rather than focusing on a particular type of relation, DISCOSENSE encompasses 37 discourse\\nconnectives signaling different discourse relation types. Second, DISCOSENSE involves reasoning\\n2Dataset Model Human\\nSW AG 91.71 88\\nNLI 91.18 92.9\\nHellaswag 93.85 95.6\\nCosmosQA 91.79 94\\nPIQA 90.13 94.9\\nSocialIQa 83.15 88.1\\nMC-TACO 80.87 75.8\\nWinoGrande 86.64 94\\nProtoQA 54.15 74.03\\nVCR 63.15 85\\nTable 1: Status of how competitive current common-sense reasoning benchmarks are for state-of-the-\\nart pre-trained language models.\\nFigure 1: Components of Adversarial Filtering.\\nwith discourse connectives, which is more complicated than reasoning with discourse relations.\\nSpecifically, as some connectives are sense-ambiguous\\n(e.g., the connective “since” may serve as a temporal or causal connective), a LM will likely need to\\n(implicitly) perform sense disambiguation in order to perform well on DISCOSENSE.\\nThere are datasets and knowledge bases where the semantic/discourse/commonsense relations are\\nexplicitly annotated and which can provide data sources from which commonsense reasoning bench-\\nmarks can be derived.

As can be seen, existing LMs\\nhave managed to achieve an accuracy of more than 80\\nAdversarial filtering (AF). Originally proposed by, AF aims to create examples that would be difficult\\nfor models to solve, specifically by replacing the easy options in correctlysolved examples with\\ndifficult ones. As shown in Figure 2, AF has three components: data (i.e., examples with multiple\\noptions, one of which is correct), a discriminator LM (a classifier that is used to solve each example)\\nand a generator LM (a model that generates new options for an example). In each AF iteration, the\\ndiscriminator LM is trained on the training set and used to solve each example in the test set. If a test\\nexample is incorrectly solved (i.e., the discriminator LM chooses the wrong option), the example\\nis deemed sufficiently difficult and no change is made to it. On the other hand, if a test example\\nis correctly solved, then AF seeks to increase its difficulty by replacing the easiest option (i.e., the\\ngenerated option that the discriminator LM classifies with the highest confidence) with a new option\\ngenerated by the generator LM. Training a new discriminator LM in each AF iteration ensures that\\nthe dataset is not just adversarial for one LM but a class of LMs, as training different instances of\\nthe same type of LMs results in models that have differently learned linguistic representations. This\\nprocess is repeated on all correctly classified examples in the test set until the performance on the test\\nset converges.\\n3Data Source DISCOSENSE Train DISCOSENSE Test\\nDISCOVERY Train Bottom 7%\\nDISCOVERY Validation 100%\\nDISCOFUSE train Top 54k w/ DC\\nTable 2: Data sources for DISCOSENSE and its composition before human verification.

The correct endings can be obtained after understanding\\nthe purpose of the given discourse connectives. Given a context c <s, d>, which is composed of a\\ncontextual sentence s and a discourse connective d as well as a set of four options O = o1, o2, o3, o4,\\nthe task is to predict the most plausible ending oi belongs to O.\\n3.2 Dataset Creation\\nTo assemble DISCOSENSE, we focus on source datasets that contain two sentences connected through\\na discourse connective. Specifically, we use two peer reviewed academic datasets, DISCOVERY\\nand DISCOFUSE. In DISCOVERY , each sentence is composed of two sentences connected via\\na discourse connective for the purpose of learning joint sentence representations with discourse\\nconnectives. DISCOFUSE, on the other hand, is assembled for the task of sentence fusion (i.e.,\\njoining several independent sentences into a single coherent sentence). We only consider those\\nexamples where a discourse connective is needed for sentence fusion, and include in DISCOSENSE\\nthe fused sentences in the Wikipedia split of DISCOFUSE. Since these datasets contain sentences from\\nCommon Crawl and Wikipedia articles, DISCOSENSE is diverse in the topics it covers. Importantly,\\nsince by construction the discourse connective is crucial in solving the underlying tasks (i.e., sentence\\nrepresentation learning and sentence fusion), the crucial role played by the discourse connectives\\nin these sentences makes them suitable for our use case. Details of how the DISCOVERY and\\nDISCOFUSE sentences are used to create DISCOSENSE are shown in Tables 2 and 3.\\n3.3 Generating Options\\nNext, we describe how we generate challenging options for DISCOSENSE using an improved version\\nof AF that we call Conditional Adversarial Filtering (CAF). CAF follows the AF procedure in Figure\\n2, only differing from AF in terms of (1) the generator LM (Section 3.3.1), (2) the discriminator LM\\n(Section 3.3.2), and (3) how the generator LMs are used to generate options (Section 3.3.3).\\n3.3.1 Conditional Generator LM\\nPre-training does not explicitly teach how important a particular token or text span is in contributing\\nto the semantics of a sentence. Hence, to be able to generate sentences that are coherent with not\\nonly the context but also the discourse connective, we propose to use Controllable Text Generation,\\nwhich aims to provide a more granular control over how generation happens to match a particular\\nattribute. In the context of Transformer-based LMs, there are two lines of research on controllable\\ntext generation. One examines how to steer generation by fine-tuning an extra set of parameters while\\nkeeping the base (unconditionally trained) model fixed while the other involves conditionally training\\na generative model on a control variable to generate text w.r.t. a prompt prefix. We adopt the latter\\n4approach, extending CTRL to explicitly steer generation w.r.t. discourse relations by using discourse\\nconnectives as control codes, as described below.\\nTraining. The input to CTRL is as follows:\\ninput: <d> <contexts> label: <endings>\\nwhere d is a discourse connective. Specifically, each input context for CTRL is prepended with a\\nconnective, and the training task for CTRL is to learn the conditional distribution p(e|d, context)\\nover possible endings e. The predicted ending is then compared with the human generated ending to\\ncompute loss. Since the original CTRL model is pre-trained with control codes suitable for openended\\ntext generation, we fine-tune CTRL on the portion of DISCOVERY shown in Table 3 using all the\\n174 connectives present in the selected splits. Comparing Tables 2 and 3, we can see that the data\\nthe generator LM is fine-tuned on is not part of DISCOSENSE. Doing so ensures that the endings\\ngenerated by the generator LM are different from the ground truth (i.e., the human written endings).\\nDecoding. We use Nucleus sampling for generating options for the training set with the value of p set\\nto 0.7, which means the\\nweights of the tail of the probability distribution are ignored (i.e., tokens with a cumulative probability\\nmass of less than 0.3 are left out). Additionally, we use a length penalty of 0.8 to restrict the length of\\nthe generations to match the average length of the ground truth to avoid the induction of length bias.\\nEfficacy of conditional generation. Recall that we propose the use of conditional generation, specifi-\\ncally the use of discourse connectives as control codes, in our generator LM because of our hypothesis\\nthat the resulting LM would generate options that are more compliant with the purpose of the dis-\\ncourse connective. To test this hypothesis, we compare the text generation capability of CTRL\\nwith that of GPT2-XL, a model that is trained unconditionally and has nearly the same number of\\nparameters (1.6B) as CTRL, under the same evaluation setting. Specifically, both LMs are fine-tuned\\non the same data (see Table 3) using the same machine (a 2x Quadro RTX 8000 with a batch size\\nof 24). The only difference between them lies in the format of the training examples: in CTRL\\nthe discourse connective is used as the control code and therefore precedes the context, whereas in\\nGPT2XL, the discourse connective follows the context.\\nThe two LMs are then independently applied to generate exactly one option for each example in the\\nDISCOVERY validation set. CTRL achieves a much lower perplexity than GPT2-XL (2.39 vs. 2.53),\\nwhich suggests that conditional training improves the quality of the generated sentences.\\n3.3.2 Discriminator LM\\nWe use ROBERTA-LARGE as the discriminator LM, which takes the context, the discourse connec-\\ntive, and the four endings as input and predicts the most plausible ending. This LM is trained on the\\nrandomly shuffled training split of DISCOSENSE and applied to the DISCOSENSE test set to get\\nthe confidence scores associated with its predictions.\\n3.3.3 Generating Options\\nNext, we describe how we generate options for the examples in DISCOSENSE. Recall that each\\nexample contains one of 174 discourse connectives. Rather than generating options for examples that\\ncontain any of these 174 connectives, we select 37 discourse connectives and generate options only\\nfor examples that contain one of them. The connectives that are discarded are primarily those that\\nimpose few constraints on the endings to be gen-\\nerated given the context according to preliminary experiments. For instance, the connective “and”\\nis discarded because numerous endings are equally plausible. Similarly for connectives that signal\\na temporal relation (e.g., “before”, “after”): they also tend to allow numerous equally plausible\\nendings, as can be seen in examples such as “John went to eat lunch after [ending]”. The 37\\nconnectives that we end up choosing are shown in Table 4. These connectives are less likely to yield\\noptions that look equally plausible to human annotators and which are indicative of different kinds\\nof discourse relations, such as EXEMPLIFICATION (e.g., “for instance”), CONCESSION (e.g.,\\n“although”), COMPARISON (e.g., “in contrast”), and CAUSAL (e.g., “as a result”). 94k examples in\\nDISCOSENSE contain one of the 37 connectives.\\n5although in other words particularly\\nbecause of this in sum specifically\\nbecause of that interestingly subsequently\\nbut instead thereafter\\nconsequently likewise thereby\\nconversely nevertheless therefore\\nfor example nonetheless though\\nfor instance on the contrary thus\\nhence on the other hand yet\\nhowever otherwise\\nin contrast overall\\nTable 4: Discourse connectives present in DISCOSENSE.\\nDiscoSense\\ntrain 9299\\nContext Answer test 3757\\ntuples total 13056\\nStatistics Train / Test\\ncontext 22.08 / 22.51\\nAverage answers (all) 18.62 / 18.92\\nanswers (correct) 16.94 / 18.18\\ntokens answers (incorrect) 18.51 / 18.5\\ncontext 32577 / 16858\\nUnique answers (all) 43992 / 27406\\ntokens answers (correct) 26836 / 15078\\nanswers (incorrect) 41158 / 25900\\nTable 5: Data statistics for DISCOSENSE.\\nTo generate the options for these 94k sentences, we begin by training 20 generator LMs on a\\nrandomly shuffled order of the generators’ training data (see Table 3) and then inserting them into a\\ncircular queue. Although the underlying data is the same, random shuffling ensures that the learned\\nrepresentations of these 20 models are different. Since each example needs to have 3 synthetic\\noptions, we use the first 3 generator LMs from the circular queue to generate the initial options for\\neach example. After that, we begin CAF. In each CAF iteration, we (1) train the discriminator LM\\n(see Section 3.3.2) on the DISCOSENSE training set for 4 epochs and use it to filter out the options\\ndeemed as easiest by the discriminator LM; and (2) use the next generator LM in the circular queue\\nto generate the options for the examples whose easiest option is removed by the discriminator LM. In\\nother words, a different discriminator LM is used in each CAF iteration, and a generator LM in the\\ncircular queue is used once every 20 CAF iterations. CAF is run separately for the DISCOSENSE\\ntraining and test sets. After running CAF for approximately 150 iterations, the average accuracy of a\\ndiscriminator LM decreased from 86–90\\n3.3.4 Other Implementation Details\\nFor the models we use in CAF, we obtain the pre-trained weights and the implementations from\\nHugging Face Transformers. These models are trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning\\nrate of 2e-5. The training of each generator LM is performed on a 2x Quadro RTX 8000 with a batch\\nsize of 24 and typically lasts for 3 days. The training of a discriminator LM is performed on a RTX\\n3090 with a batch size of 16 and typically lasts for 5–6 hours.\\n3.4 Human Verification\\nNext, we perform human verification of the examples for which we have generated options. The\\nverification proceeds in two steps. In Step 1, we ask three human verifiers to independently identify\\nthe correct option for each example, removing an example if at least one person fails to identify the\\ncorrect option. We repeat this process until the number of examples that survive this verification\\n6Model Accuracy / std\\nRandom Guess 25.0\\nBERT-BASE (110M) 32.86 / 0.45\\nBERT-LARGE (336M) 34.25 / 1.04\\nROBERTA-BASE (125M) 34.11 / 0.45\\nROBERTA-LARGE (355M) 34 / 0.2\\nALBERT-XXLARGE-V2 (223M) 50.91 / 1.44\\nLONGFORMER BASE (435M) 35.29 / 0.77\\nXLNET LARGE (340M) 36.71 / 0.77\\nFUNNEL-TRANSFORMER-XL (468M) 35.22 / 1.94\\nELECTRA-LARGE 65.87 / 2.26\\nHuman Performance 95.40 / 0.20\\nTable 6: Accuracies (best results obtained among 8 epochs when averaged over 5 runs with random\\nseeds) of the LMs on the DISCOSENSE test set.\\nreaches 13,056. In Step 2, we ask three human verifiers not involved in Step 1 to independently\\nidentify the correct option for each of the 13,056 examples verified in Step 1. We compute for\\neach verifier the accuracy of choosing the correct option and use the average accuracy as the human\\nperformance on DISCOSENSE. Appendix A contains the details on how the human verifiers are\\nrecruited and the annotation instructions we present to them.\\n3.5 Dataset Statistics\\nStatistics on DISCOSENSE are shown in Table 5, in which we report the average number of tokens\\nin (1) the context, (2) the ground truth and (3) the generated endings. The number of unique tokens\\nprovides a rough characterization of the richness of the vocabulary. In addition, we report the\\ndistribution of the examples over the discourse connectives in DISCOSENSE in Figure 3.\\n4 Evaluation\\n4.1 Baseline Systems\\nOur baselines are composed of prominent LMs with different kinds of Transformer architectures. First,\\nwe consider models that are pre-trained in a BERT-like fashion and share architectural similarities,\\nincluding the base and large variants of BERT and ROBERTA, as well as ALBERT-XXLARGE-V2.\\nAs an extension, we select LONGFORMER BASE, which is pre-trained in the same manner as\\nROBERTA but has a sparse attention matrix. From the autoregressive/decoder based networks,\\nwe experiment with XLNET LARGE, which maximizes the learning of bidirectional contexts and\\nGPT2-XL. For\\nmodels trained with a different pre-training objective, we experiment with ELECTRA-LARGE and\\nFUNNEL-TRANSFORMER-XL, the latter of which is pre-trained in a similar manner as ELECTRA-\\nLARGE.\\nWe obtain the implementations of these LMs from Hugging Face Transformers. We fine-tune them on\\nthe DISCOSENSE training set using a 4way cross-entropy loss in the same way as the discriminator\\nLMs in CAF are trained (see Section 3.3.4) and evaluate them on the test set.\\n4.2 Results and Discussion\\nResults on the test set, which are expressed in terms of accuracy, are shown in Table 6. A few points\\ndeserve mention.\\nFirst, all baselines perform better than random guess (row 1). This implies that while CAF is used to\\nremove easy options, there may still be artifacts in the data that could be exploited by the LMs.\\nSecond, models sharing a similar pre-training objective as that of BERT, such as ROBERTA and\\nLONGFORMER, are among the worst baselines. A similar trend is observed with XLNET. Although\\n7ALBERT has the Masked Token Prediction task in its pre-training objective, its architectural differ-\\nences (i.e., larger hidden states and parameter sharing) and its Sentence Order Prediction objective\\nseem to help it learn inter-sentence coherency properties better than its BERT counterparts.\\nThird, pre-training appears to play a predominant role in our task. While the BERT family of models\\nare trained with the masked-LM objective, the pre-training objective of ELECTRA (the best baseline)\\nis designed to determine if a token in a human-written sentence has been replaced by a generator. We\\nspeculate that ELECTRA’s superior\\nperformance can be attributed to the fact that its pretrained knowledge of discriminating between syn-\\nthetic and human generated tokens transfers well to the task of discriminating between synthetically\\ngenerated sentences and human written sentences in DISCOSENSE. Nevertheless, the fact that it\\nonly achieves an accuracy of 65.87\\nFinally, we report human performance in the last row of Table 6. Details of how these numbers are\\nobtained are discussed in Section 3.4. As can be seen, the accuracy achieved by the best baseline,\\nELECTRA, lags behind that of humans by nearly 30\\n4.3 Quantitative Error Analysis\\nWe perform a quantitative error analysis of our best-performing model, ELECTRA. Specifically,\\nwe compute for each discourse connective the percentage of examples in the DISCOSENSE test\\nset that are misclassified by ELECTRA, with the goal of gaining a better understanding of the\\ndiscourse connectives that are perceived as easy as well as those that are perceived as difficult as far\\nas commonsense reasoning is concerned.\\nResults are shown in Figure 4. As we can see,\\nthe misclassification rates are highest for those discourse connectives that express contrast (e.g.,\\n“otherwise”, “however”, “but”, “although”). A plausible explanation for this result is that it is often\\nhard to anticipate what a human would have in mind if they are trying to indicate the opposite of what\\nthey mean to say. On the other hand, the model finds it easy to predict sentences where the discourse\\nconnective signals compliance and exemplification (e.g., “similarly”, “likewise”, “hence”, “because\\nof that”, “for example”).\\n4.4 Qualitative Error Analysis\\nTo better understand the mistakes made by ELECTRA, we manually inspected 100 randomly selected\\nexamples that are misclassified and identified four major reasons why they are misclassified.\\nLess plausible endings. This category contributes to 21 perentt of the errors where the model\\nchooses a less plausible ending. Choosing a less plausible option could be associated with a partial\\nunderstanding of the context or unwarranted assumptions. In Example 1 of Figure 5, the model makes\\nthe assumption that whatever is applicable to grass is also applicable to trees. However, the option it\\nends up picking is non-factual in nature because of the phrase “7000 years ago”.\\nAbstract associations. 14 percent of the errors are made due to the formation of abstract associations\\nbetween concepts. The model seems to rely on certain spans of context for classification rather than\\nunderstand the semantics in its entirety. In Example 2 of Figure 5, the model seems to wrongly\\nassociate “energy dense nutrients” with “obesity” and fails to understand that the context is discussing\\nthe correlation between nutrient deficit diet and people belonging to lower income groups.\\nComplex Context Understanding. 23\\nAlthough the grasses were only a moment old, they appeared as if they were months old. Likewise\\na) Similar phenomena occurred with the ancient trees around the earth 7,000 years ago.\\nb) The dinosaurs were not billions of years old.\\nc) Several seeds were found encased within stems that are several months old, but they seemed quite\\nfresh and alive. d) The trees, although only a day old when they sprouted forth, were nevertheless\\nlike trees years old as they were fully grown.\\n8Low income people are less likely to consume a healthy diet than wealthier people, and energy\\ndense nutrients poor diets are preferentially consumed by persons of lower socioeconomic status.\\nConsequently\\na) Nutrients associated with these diets may be potentially contributing to obesity and diabetes.\\nb) Metabolic syndrome is primarily related to obesity. c) Their health is at greater risk from diet\\nrelated illness. d) A great number of persons suffering from obesity related diseases receive inadequate\\nnutritional care.\\nIt weighs on a mind, all this but\\na) You have to live it if you want to know whats on it. b) All that means in practice.\\nc) It does make me want to back up and ask even bigger questions. d) In a kind of perverse way, I\\ndon’t really feel sad.\\nFigure 5: Examples misclassified by ELECTRA (misclassified options in pink; ground truths in\\ngreen).\\nmake a person do, in this case, “ask bigger questions”.\\nLack of understanding of the discourse connective. In many cases it is difficult to pinpoint the reason\\nwhy an example is misclassified. Hence, if a misclassified example is not covered by any of the first\\nthree categories, we attribute the mistake to a lack of understanding of the discourse connective. This\\ncategory contributes to 42\\n4.5 Role of Context and Discourse connective\\nTo better understand the role played by the context and the discourse connective in a LM’s reasoning\\nprocess, we conduct two ablation experiments. In the first experiment, we remove the discourse\\nconnective, so only the context and the endings are available to the LMs. In the second experiment,\\nwe strip the context and the discourse connective, exposing only the endings to the LMs.\\nResults of these experiments are shown in the C+E column and the E column of Table 7 respectively.\\nFor comparison purposes,\\n9'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'API with a Rich Linguistic Resource\\nAbstract\\nThis paper introduces a novel Python API, incorporated within the NLTK library,\\nthat facilitates access to the FrameNet 1.7 lexical database. The API enables pro-\\ngrammatic processing of the lexicon, which is organized by frames, and annotated\\nsentences. Additionally, it offers user-friendly displays accessible through the\\ninteractive Python interface for browsing.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper delves into the significance of the Berkeley FrameNet project, an endeavor that has been\\nongoing for over a decade. FrameNet meticulously documents the vocabulary of modern English,\\nutilizing the framework of frame semantics. This freely available and linguistically comprehensive\\nresource encompasses more than 1,000 semantic frames, 10,000 lexical senses, and 100,000 lexical\\nannotations embedded within corpus sentences. It has served as a foundational element for extensive\\nresearch in natural language processing, particularly in the area of semantic role labeling.\\nDespite FrameNet’s importance, computational users frequently encounter obstacles due to the\\ncomplexity of its custom XML format. While the resource is largely navigable on the web, some\\ndetails pertaining to linguistic descriptions and annotations are not easily accessible through the\\nHTML data views. Furthermore, the few existing open-source APIs for interacting with FrameNet\\ndata have become outdated and have not achieved widespread adoption.\\nThis paper introduces a new, easy-to-use Python API that provides a way to explore FrameNet data.\\nThis API is integrated into recent versions of the widely-used NLTK suite and grants access to nearly\\nall of the information within the FrameNet release.\\n2 Installation\\nTo install NLTK, please refer to the instructions at nltk.org. NLTK offers cross-platform functionality\\nand is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x environments. It is also included in the\\nAnaconda and Enthought Canopy Python distributions, which are frequently utilized by data scientists.\\nIn an active NLTK setup (version 3.2.2 or later), the FrameNet data can be downloaded through a\\nsingle method call:\\n>>> import nltk\\n>>> nltk.download(’framenet_v17’)\\nThe data will be installed under the user’s home directory by default. Note that Frame-to-frame\\nrelations include mappings between individual frame elements. These mappings are not exposed in\\nthe HTML frame definitions on the website but can be explored visually via the FrameGrapher tool\\non the website. Our API does not display these relations directly in the frame display but rather via\\nindividual frame relation objects or the fe_relations() method, as discussed in Section 4.4.\\n38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).3 Overview of FrameNet\\nFrameNet is built around conceptual structures called frames. A semantic frame depicts a situation,\\nwhich could be an event, a state, or any other scenario that can be either universal or specific to a\\nculture, as well as either broad or narrow in scope. The frame identifies participant roles known as\\nframe elements (FEs). These relationships create the conceptual framework necessary to understand\\ncertain meanings of vocabulary items.\\nSome examples include:\\n• Verbs like buy, sell, and pay, along with nouns like buyer, seller, price, and purchase, are\\ndefined within a commercial transaction scenario (frame). Central FEs in this frame, which\\nmay be explicitly mentioned in a text or not, include the Buyer, the Seller, the Goods being\\nsold, and the Money that is paid.\\n• The notion of REVENGE, manifested in words such as revenge, avenge, avenger, retaliate,\\npayback, and get even, fundamentally relies on an Injury that an Offender has inflicted upon\\nan Injured_party. An Avenger (who might or might not be the same as the Injured_party)\\nattempts to impose a Punishment on the Offender.\\n• A hypotenuse implies a geometrical concept of a right triangle, whereas a pedestrian suggests\\na street with both vehicular and nonvehicular traffic.\\nThe FEs within a frame are formally enumerated, along with a description of their role within the\\nframe. Frames are connected in a network, which includes a hierarchy where one frame inherits from\\nanother, and other frame-to-frame relationships. V ocabulary items that are part of a frame are called\\nlexical units (LUs). FrameNet’s LUs include both content and function words, linking a lemma to a\\nframe.\\nIn a text, an LU token is said to evoke the frame. Sentences are annotated with regard to frame-\\nevoking tokens and the spans of their FEs. For example, in \"[Snape]Injured_party’s revenge [on\\nHarry]Offender\", the labels denote the participants of the REVENGE frame.\\n4 API Overview\\n4.1 Design Principles\\nThe API is built with these principles in mind:\\n• Simplicity: Access to the main database objects, such as frames, lexical units, and annota-\\ntions, should be simple, whether through iteration or targeted searches. To avoid overloading\\nthe API with methods, additional details can be accessed as object attributes. The help()\\nmethod provides a synopsis of key database access methods.\\n• Discoverability: Given the database’s complexity, the API makes it easy to browse objects\\nusing the Python interactive prompt. This is mainly accomplished through well-formatted\\nobject displays, similar to the frame display in Figure 1 (see Section 4.3). These displays\\nshow users how to access object attributes they might not otherwise be aware of.\\n• On-demand loading:The database is split into many XML files. The FrameNet 1.7 release,\\nonce unzipped, is 855 MB. Loading all of these files, particularly the corpus annotations, is\\nslow and resource-intensive. The API uses lazy data structures to load XML files only as\\nrequired, storing all loaded data in memory for quick subsequent access.\\n4.2 Lexicon Access Methods\\nThe primary methods for accessing lexicon data are:\\n• frames(name): returns all frames matching the provided name pattern.\\n• frame(nameOrId): returns a single frame matching the name or the ID\\n• lus(name, frame): returns all lexical units matching the provided name pattern.\\n• lu(id): returns a lexical unit based on its ID\\n2• fes(name, frame): returns all frame elements based on the name pattern provided\\nMethods with plural names use regular expressions to search entries. Also, the lus() and fes()\\nmethods allow you to specify a frame to constrain the results. These methods return lists of elements,\\nand if no arguments are provided, they return all entries of the lexicon.\\nBelow is an example of a search using the frame name pattern:\\n>>> fn.frames(’(?i)creat’)\\n[<frame ID=268 name=Cooking_creation>, <frame ID=1658 name=Create_physical_artwork>, ...]\\nHere is an example of a search using the LU name pattern, note that the .v suffix is used for all verbal\\nLUs:\\n>>> fn.lus(r’.+en\\\\\\\\.v’)\\n[<lu ID=5331 name=awaken.v>, <lu ID=7544 name=betoken.v>, ...]\\nThe frame() and lu() methods are used to get an entry by name or ID. A FramenetError will be\\nraised when trying to retrieve a non-existent entry.\\nTwo extra methods are available for frame lookups: frame_ids_and_names(name) gets a mapping\\nfrom frame IDs to names and frames_by_lemma(name) returns all the frames that have LUs\\nmatching the provided name pattern.\\n4.3 Database Objects\\nAll structured objects like frames, LUs, and FEs are loaded as AttrDict data structures, where keys\\ncan be accessed as attributes. For instance:\\n>>> f = fn.frame(’Revenge’)\\n>>> f.keys()\\ndict_keys([’cBy’, ’cDate’, ’name’, ’ID’, ’_type’, ’definition’,\\n’definitionMarkup’, ’frameRelations’, ’FE’, ’FEcoreSets’,\\n’lexUnit’, ’semTypes’, ’URL’])\\n>>> f.name\\n’Revenge’\\n>>> f.ID\\n347\\nThe API provides user-friendly displays for important object types, presenting their contents in an\\norganized manner. For example, calling fn.frame(’Revenge’) prints the display for the REVENGE\\nframe. These displays indicate attribute names in square brackets.\\nframe (347): Revenge\\n[URL] https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/frame/Revenge.xml\\n[definition]\\nThis frame concerns the infliction of punishment in return for a wrong suffered. An Avenger performs a Punishment on a Offender as a consequence of an earlier action by the Offender, the Injury. The Avenger inflicting thePunishment need not be the same as the Injured_Party who suffered the Injury, but the Avenger does have to share the judgment that the Offender’s action was wrong. The judgment that the Offender had inflicted an Injury is made without regard to the law. ’(1) They took revenge for the deaths of two loyalist prisoners.’ ’(2) Lachlan went out to avenge them.’ ’(3) The next day, the Roman forces took revenge on their enemies..’\\n[semTypes] 0 semantic types\\n[frameRelations] 1 frame relations <Parent=Rewards_and_punishments -- Inheritance -> Child=Revenge>\\n[lexUnit] 18 lexical units avenge.v (6056), avenger.n (6057), get back (at).v (10003), get even.v (6075), payback.n (10124), retaliate.v (6065), retaliation.n (6071), retribution.n (6070), retributive.a (6074), retributory.a (6076), revenge.n (6067), revenge.v (6066), revengeful.a (6073), revenger.n (6072), sanction.n (10676), vengeance.n (6058), vengeful.a (6068), vindictive.a (6069)\\n[FE] 14 frame elements Core: Avenger (3009), Injured_party (3022), Injury (3018), Offender (3012), Punishment (3015) Peripheral: Degree (3010), Duration (12060), Instrument (3013), Manner (3014), Place (3016), Purpose (3017), Time (3021) Extra-Thematic: Depictive (3011), Result (3020)\\n[FEcoreSets] 2 frame element core sets Injury, Injured_party Avenger, Punishment\\n4.4 Advanced Lexicon Access\\nFrame relations. Frames are organized in a network through different frame-to-frame relations. For\\nexample, the REVENGE frame is related to the REW ARDS_AND_PUNISHMENTS frame through\\nInheritance. Each relation includes mappings between corresponding FEs of the two frames. These\\nrelations can be browsed with the frame_relations(frame, frame2, type) method. Within a\\nframe relation object, mappings between FEs are stored in the feRelations attribute. The method\\nfe_relations() gives direct access to the links between FEs. The available relation types can be\\nobtained by frame_relation_types().\\n3Semantic types. Semantic types provide added semantic labels for FEs, frames, and LUs. For FEs,\\nthey show selectional constraints. The method propagate_semtypes() propagates the semantic\\ntype labels to other FEs using inference rules derived from FE relations. The semtypes() method\\nreturns all semantic types, semtype() returns a specific type, and semtype_inherits() checks if\\ntwo semantic types are in a subtype-supertype relationship.\\n4.5 Corpus Access\\nFrame annotations of sentences are accessible through the exemplars and subCorpus attributes of\\na LU object or using the following methods:\\n• annotations(luname, exemplars, full_text)\\n• sents()\\n• exemplars(luname)\\n• ft_sents(docname)\\n• doc(id)\\n• docs(name)\\nThe annotations() method returns a list of frame annotation sets. These sets comprise a frame-\\nevoking target in a sentence, the LU in the frame, the FEs found in the sentence, and the status of any\\nnull-instantiated FEs. The user may specify the LU name, or annotation type (exemplar or full_text).\\nCorpus sentences are accessed in two forms: exemplars() gives sentences with lexicographic\\nannotations, and ft_sents() gives sentences from full-text annotations. sents() provides an\\niterator over all sentences. Each sentence object has several annotation sets, the first is for sentence\\nlevel annotations, the following for frame annotations.\\nexemplar sentence (929548):\\n[sentNo] 0\\n[aPos] 1113164\\n[LU] (6067) revenge.n in Revenge\\n[frame] (347) Revenge\\n[annotationSet] 2 annotation sets\\n[POS] 12 tags\\n[POS_tagset] BNC\\n[GF] 4 relations\\n[PT] 4 phrases\\n[text] + [Target] + [FE] + [Noun]\\nA short while later Joseph had his revenge on Watney ’s .\\nTime Offender\\n[Injury:DNI] (Avenge=Avenger, sup=supp, Ave=Avenger)\\nfull-text sentence (4148528) in Tiger_Of_San_Pedro:\\n[POS] 25 tags\\n[POS_tagset] PENN\\n[text] + [annotationSet]\\nThey ’ve been looking for him all the time for their revenge , ******* ******* Seeking Revenge [3] ? [2]\\nbut it is only now that they have begun to find him out . \" ***** **** Proce Beco [1] [4]\\n(Proce=Process_start, Beco=Becoming_aware)\\n5 Limitations and Future Work\\nThe main FrameNet component that the API does not support right now is valence patterns, which\\nsummarize the FE’s syntactic realizations across annotated tokens for an LU. In the future, we intend\\nto include support for valence patterns, along with improved capabilities for annotation querying, and\\nbetter syntactic information displays for FE annotations. Moreover, it is worth investigating whether\\nthe API can be modified to work with other language FrameNets, also to support cross-lingual\\nmappings.\\n4'},\n",

Large pretrained models, while powerful, often\\nlose this crucial equivariance during adaptation to new tasks using standard techniques. This loss\\ncan significantly impact performance and generalization. The inherent symmetries present in many\\ndatasets are often exploited implicitly or explicitly by the model architecture. For example, con-\\nvolutional neural networks implicitly leverage translation equivariance, while other architectures\\nare designed to explicitly incorporate other symmetries. However, standard fine-tuning or transfer\\nlearning methods often disrupt these inherent symmetries, leading to a degradation in performance\\nand robustness. This is particularly problematic when dealing with large pretrained models, where the\\ncomputational cost of retraining can be prohibitive. Furthermore, the loss of equivariance can lead to\\nunpredictable behavior and reduced generalization capabilities, especially when the test data differs\\nsignificantly from the training data in terms of transformations. This necessitates the development of\\nnovel adaptation techniques that explicitly preserve equivariance.\\nThis paper addresses the challenge of adapting large pretrained models to new tasks while preserving\\ntheir inherent equivariance. We introduce a novel method that leverages regularization techniques\\nto maintain equivariance during the adaptation process. Our approach carefully balances the need\\nto optimize for task-specific performance with the constraint of preserving the model’s equivariant\\nproperties. This is achieved through a carefully designed loss function that combines standard task-\\nspecific losses with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior.\\nThe regularization term is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different types of transformations\\nand model architectures. This allows our method to be applied to a wide range of problems and\\nmodels. The key innovation lies in the formulation of the regularization term, which is derived from\\nthe theoretical properties of equivariant functions and carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization.\\nThe proposed method is rigorously evaluated on a diverse set of benchmark datasets, showcasing\\nsignificant performance improvements over existing adaptation techniques. We demonstrate that\\nour approach effectively preserves equivariance while achieving state-of-the-art results on several\\n.challenging tasks. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters on both\\nperformance and equivariance provides valuable insights into optimal configurations for various\\nscenarios. The results highlight the critical importance of preserving equivariance during model\\nadaptation and underscore the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our findings suggest that\\nincorporating equivariance constraints during adaptation is a promising avenue for enhancing the\\nrobustness and generalization capabilities of large pretrained models.\\nOur work contributes to the growing field of equivariant neural networks??, extending its scope to\\nthe complex problem of model adaptation. We provide a valuable tool for adapting large pretrained\\nmodels while retaining their desirable properties. The ability to maintain equivariance during\\nadaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in applications where symmetry\\nis paramount. Future research will focus on extending our method to more intricate scenarios and\\nexploring its applications in diverse domains. We believe that our approach represents a significant\\nstep towards developing more robust and reliable adaptation techniques for large pretrained models.\\nFinally, we acknowledge the limitations of our approach and propose avenues for future research.\\nWhile our method demonstrates substantial improvements in preserving equivariance, challenges\\nremain. For instance, enforcing equivariance constraints can be computationally expensive, especially\\nfor large models and complex transformations. Future work will focus on developing more efficient\\nalgorithms to mitigate this computational burden. Furthermore, we plan to explore the application of\\nour method to a broader range of tasks and datasets, further validating its generality and robustness.\\nThe potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of our method is a key focus for future\\nresearch.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe adaptation of large pretrained models has been a significant area of research, with various\\ntechniques proposed to improve performance on downstream tasks. Fine-tuning, transfer learning,\\nand other adaptation strategies have shown remarkable success in many applications. However,\\nthese methods often neglect the crucial aspect of preserving the inherent equivariance properties\\nof the pretrained models. Our work directly addresses this limitation by explicitly incorporating\\nequivariance constraints during the adaptation process. This contrasts with existing approaches that\\nprimarily focus on optimizing task-specific performance without considering the potential loss of\\nequivariance. The preservation of equivariance is particularly important in domains where symmetries\\nplay a crucial role, such as image processing, physics simulations, and robotics. Existing methods\\noften fail to capture these symmetries effectively, leading to suboptimal performance and reduced\\ngeneralization capabilities.\\nEarly work on equivariant neural networks focused on designing architectures that explicitly incor-\\nporate symmetries into their structure. Groups such as the rotation group SO(2) and the translation\\ngroup have been extensively studied, leading to the development of specialized layers and architec-\\ntures that exhibit desired equivariance properties. These architectures, while effective in specific\\nscenarios, often lack the flexibility and scalability required for adapting large pretrained models. Our\\napproach offers a more general framework that can be applied to a wider range of architectures and\\ntransformations, without requiring significant modifications to the model structure. This flexibility\\nis crucial for adapting large pretrained models, which often have complex and highly specialized\\narchitectures.\\nRecent research has explored the use of regularization techniques to encourage equivariance in\\nneural networks. These methods typically involve adding penalty terms to the loss function that\\npenalize deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. However, many of these approaches are\\ncomputationally expensive or require significant modifications to the training process. Our method\\noffers a more efficient and practical approach, leveraging a carefully designed regularization term that\\ncan be easily integrated into existing training pipelines. The key innovation lies in the formulation\\nof this regularization term, which is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions\\nand carefully tuned to avoid over-regularization. This ensures that the adapted model retains its\\nequivariance properties without sacrificing performance on the downstream task.\\nFurthermore, our work builds upon the growing body of research on incorporating inductive biases\\ninto neural networks. Inductive biases, which encode prior knowledge about the problem domain,\\nhave been shown to significantly improve the efficiency and generalization capabilities of neural\\n2networks. Equivariance is a powerful inductive bias that can be leveraged to improve the performance\\nof models on tasks with inherent symmetries. Our approach provides a principled way to incorporate\\nthis inductive bias during the adaptation process, ensuring that the adapted model benefits from the\\nprior knowledge encoded in the pretrained model while still adapting effectively to the new task. This\\ncombination of leveraging pretrained knowledge and enforcing equivariance is a key contribution of\\nour work.\\nIn summary, our work differs from existing approaches by explicitly addressing the preservation\\nof equivariance during the adaptation of large pretrained models. We propose a novel method\\nthat combines task-specific optimization with a carefully designed regularization term to maintain\\nequivariance. This approach offers a flexible and efficient way to adapt large pretrained models\\nwhile preserving their desirable properties, leading to improved performance and generalization\\ncapabilities. Our work contributes to the growing field of equivariant neural networks and provides\\na valuable tool for adapting these models to new tasks in various domains. The ability to maintain\\nequivariance during adaptation opens up new possibilities for deploying these models in applications\\nwhere symmetry is paramount.\\n3 Methodology\\nThis section details the proposed method for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. Our\\napproach leverages a novel regularization technique to maintain the model’s inherent equivariance\\nproperties during the adaptation process. The core idea is to augment the standard task-specific loss\\nfunction with an additional term that penalizes deviations from the desired equivariant behavior. This\\nensures that the adapted model retains its symmetry properties while still achieving high performance\\non the new task. The regularization term is carefully designed to be flexible and adaptable to\\ndifferent types of transformations and model architectures, allowing for broad applicability. We\\nachieve this flexibility by parameterizing the regularization term to account for various transformation\\ngroups and their associated representations. This allows us to handle a wide range of symmetries,\\nfrom simple translations and rotations to more complex transformations. The specific form of the\\nregularization term is derived from the theoretical properties of equivariant functions, ensuring a\\nprincipled approach to preserving equivariance. Furthermore, we employ techniques to prevent over-\\nregularization, ensuring that the model’s performance on the target task is not unduly compromised.\\nThe hyperparameters controlling the strength of the regularization are carefully tuned through cross-\\nvalidation to find the optimal balance between equivariance preservation and task performance.\\nThe adaptation process begins by initializing the model with the weights of a pre-trained equivariant\\nmodel. We then define a composite loss function that combines a standard task-specific loss (e.g.,\\ncross-entropy for classification, mean squared error for regression) with our proposed equivariance-\\npreserving regularization term. The task-specific loss encourages the model to perform well on the\\nnew task, while the regularization term ensures that the model’s output transforms predictably under\\nthe relevant transformations. The specific form of the regularization term depends on the type of\\nequivariance being preserved and the model architecture. For instance, for translation equivariance,\\nthe regularization term might penalize differences in the model’s output when the input is translated.\\nFor rotational equivariance, the regularization term might penalize differences in the model’s output\\nwhen the input is rotated. The choice of regularization term is crucial for the success of our method,\\nand we provide a detailed analysis of different regularization strategies in the supplementary material.\\nThe entire process is optimized using standard gradient-based optimization techniques, such as\\nstochastic gradient descent or Adam.\\nA key aspect of our methodology is the careful selection and tuning of hyperparameters. These\\nhyperparameters control the strength of the regularization term, the type of transformations considered,\\nand other aspects of the adaptation process. We employ a rigorous hyperparameter search strategy,\\nusing techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization, to identify the optimal configuration\\nfor each dataset and task. The performance of the adapted model is evaluated using standard metrics,\\nsuch as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and mean squared error and\\nR-squared for regression tasks. In addition to these standard metrics, we also evaluate the degree of\\nequivariance preserved by the adapted model using quantitative measures. These measures assess\\nhow well the model’s output transforms according to the expected equivariance properties under\\nvarious transformations. This allows us to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of our regularization\\ntechnique in preserving equivariance during the adaptation process.\\n3The computational cost of enforcing equivariance constraints can be significant, especially for large\\nmodels and complex transformations. To mitigate this, we explore various optimization strategies,\\nincluding efficient computation of the regularization term and the use of specialized hardware\\naccelerators. We also investigate the use of approximation techniques to reduce the computational\\nburden without significantly compromising the accuracy of the equivariance preservation. These\\nstrategies are crucial for making our method scalable and applicable to a wide range of models and\\ntasks. The efficiency of our method is a key focus of our experimental evaluation, and we provide a\\ndetailed analysis of the computational cost and scalability of our approach. Furthermore, we explore\\nthe trade-off between computational cost and the degree of equivariance preservation, providing\\ninsights into the optimal balance for different scenarios.\\nIn summary, our methodology provides a principled and flexible framework for adapting large\\npretrained models while preserving their equivariance properties. The key components are a carefully\\ndesigned regularization term, a robust hyperparameter search strategy, and efficient optimization\\ntechniques. The combination of these elements allows us to achieve high performance on downstream\\ntasks while maintaining the desirable equivariance properties of the pretrained model. This approach\\nopens up new possibilities for deploying large pretrained models in applications where symmetry\\nplays a crucial role, such as image processing, physics simulations, and robotics. The flexibility and\\nscalability of our method make it applicable to a wide range of models and tasks, paving the way for\\nmore robust and reliable adaptation techniques in the future.\\n4 Experiments\\nThis section details the experimental setup, datasets used, and results obtained using our proposed\\nmethod for equivariant adaptation of large pretrained models. We evaluate our approach on a range\\nof benchmark datasets representing diverse domains and transformation groups, demonstrating its\\nbroad applicability and effectiveness. The datasets selected encompass scenarios with varying levels\\nof complexity in terms of the underlying symmetries and the difficulty of the downstream tasks.\\nThis allows for a comprehensive assessment of our method’s performance across different scenarios\\nand its robustness to variations in data characteristics. We compare our method against several\\nstate-of-the-art adaptation techniques, including standard fine-tuning, transfer learning with various\\nregularization strategies, and other methods designed to preserve specific types of equivariance. This\\ncomparative analysis provides a clear demonstration of the advantages of our proposed approach in\\nterms of both performance and equivariance preservation. The experiments are designed to rigorously\\nassess the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance and equivariance of the adapted\\nmodels, providing valuable insights into the optimal configuration for various scenarios. We also\\nanalyze the computational cost of our method and compare it to the computational cost of alternative\\napproaches.\\nOur experimental setup involves training several large pretrained models, including convolutional\\nneural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), on various datasets. For each dataset,\\nwe consider different downstream tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and graph\\nclassification. The pretrained models are chosen based on their suitability for the specific task and\\ntheir inherent equivariance properties. For example, for image classification tasks, we use CNNs\\nknown for their translation equivariance, while for graph classification tasks, we use GNNs designed\\nto handle various graph transformations. The adaptation process involves fine-tuning the pretrained\\nmodels using our proposed method, which incorporates an equivariance-preserving regularization\\nterm into the loss function. The hyperparameters of our method, including the strength of the\\nregularization term and the type of transformations considered, are carefully tuned using a grid search\\napproach. The performance of the adapted models is evaluated using standard metrics appropriate\\nfor the specific task, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks, and\\nmean squared error and R-squared for regression tasks. In addition to these standard metrics, we also\\nevaluate the degree of equivariance preserved by the adapted models using quantitative measures.\\nThe results presented in Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed\\nmethod compared to existing adaptation techniques.

We conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets,\\ncomparing our approach against state-of-the-art adaptation techniques. Our evaluation focuses\\non two key aspects: (1) performance on the target task, measured using standard metrics such as\\naccuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification), and mean squared error (MSE), R-squared\\n(for regression); and (2) preservation of equivariance, assessed using quantitative measures that\\ncapture the consistency of the model’s output under various transformations. The datasets were\\nchosen to represent diverse domains and transformation groups, allowing for a comprehensive\\nassessment of our method’s robustness and generalizability. We considered various downstream tasks,\\nincluding image classification, object detection, and graph classification, to demonstrate the broad\\napplicability of our approach. The hyperparameters of our method were carefully tuned using a grid\\nsearch approach to optimize performance and equivariance preservation.\\nTable 3 shows the results of our experiments on an image classification dataset. We compare our\\nmethod against standard fine-tuning, transfer learning, and two other state-of-the-art equivariance-\\npreserving adaptation methods (Method A [5] and Method B [6]). Our method achieves the highest\\naccuracy (95%) and the best equivariance score (85%), significantly outperforming the other methods.\\nThis demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in preserving equivariance while achieving\\nhigh performance on the target task. The improved equivariance score suggests that our method\\nsuccessfully maintains the model’s inherent symmetry properties during adaptation, leading to better\\n5generalization and robustness. The superior accuracy indicates that our method does not compromise\\ntask performance in the pursuit of equivariance preservation. Further analysis of the confusion\\nmatrices revealed that our method significantly reduced misclassifications in challenging cases,\\nparticularly those involving transformations of the input images.\\nTable 4 presents the results on a regression task. Here, we compare our method with standard\\nfine-tuning and transfer learning, focusing on MSE and computational time. Our method achieves the\\nlowest MSE (0.08), indicating superior predictive accuracy. While the computational time is slightly\\nhigher (1800s) compared to standard fine-tuning (1200s), the significant improvement in accuracy\\njustifies the increased computational cost. The increase in computational time is primarily due to\\nthe additional computation required for the equivariance-preserving regularization term. However,\\nthis overhead is manageable and does not significantly hinder the practicality of our method. Further\\noptimization strategies, such as efficient computation of the regularization term and the use of\\nspecialized hardware, could further reduce the computational cost.\\nFigure ?? (included in the supplementary material) visually demonstrates the equivariance preserva-\\ntion achieved by our method. The figure shows the model’s output under various transformations\\nof the input, highlighting the consistent and predictable changes in the output, which is a hallmark\\nof equivariance. This visual representation complements the quantitative measures presented in\\nTables 3 and 4, providing a more comprehensive understanding of our method’s effectiveness. The\\nsupplementary material also includes a detailed analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters\\non both performance and equivariance, providing valuable insights into the optimal configuration for\\nvarious scenarios.

       "  'file_content': 'Investigating Humanoid Robot Interaction in\\nCorporate Settings: A BERT-Based Study of\\nHumor-Driven Employee Dynamics\\nAbstract\\nThis study undertakes a comprehensive examination of the psycholinguistic effects\\nof robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, leveraging a BERT-based analysis\\nof humanoid punchlines to elucidate the complex interplay between artificial\\nhumor and human emotional responses. By deploying a custom-designed robot\\ncomedian in a series of controlled experiments, we uncover a fascinating paradox\\nwherein the most effective humoristic interventions are those that deliberately\\nsubvert traditional notions of comedic timing and delivery, instead embracing a\\nstaccato, arrhythmic cadence that defies human intuitive expectations. Moreover,\\nour findings suggest that the optimal joking frequency for maximizing workplace\\nmorale is precisely 4.27 jokes per hour, a figure that appears to be impervious\\nto contextual fluctuations in audience mood and demographic composition. In a\\nstriking twist, we also discover that the integration of robot stand-up comedy into\\nthe work environment precipitates a statistically significant increase in employee\\ncreativity, as measured by a proprietary metric dubbed \"Innovation Quotient\" –\\nalthough this effect is mysteriously mitigated by the presence of potted plants in\\nthe workspace. Through this research, we contribute to a deeper understanding of\\nthe intersection of artificial intelligence, humor, and organizational behavior, while\\nsimultaneously illuminating the uncharted territories of robot-assisted comedic\\nintervention and its far-reaching implications for the future of work.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe integration of robots into the workplace has become increasingly prevalent, with many organi-\\nzations leveraging robotic systems to enhance productivity and efficiency. However, the impact of\\nrobots on workplace morale has been a topic of significant interest, with some studies suggesting that\\nthe presence of robots can lead to increased stress and anxiety among human employees. In an effort\\nto mitigate these negative effects, a growing number of companies have begun to explore the use of\\nrobot stand-up comedy as a means of boosting workplace morale. This approach, which involves the\\ndeployment of humanoid robots trained to deliver jokes and humorous anecdotes, has been shown to\\nhave a profound impact on employee wellbeing and job satisfaction.\\nOne of the key factors contributing to the success of robot stand-up comedy is the use of sophisticated\\nnatural language processing algorithms, such as BERT, to generate and analyze humanoid punchlines.\\nBy leveraging these advanced technologies, researchers are able to gain a deeper understanding of the\\ncomplex psycholinguistic mechanisms underlying human humor and laughter. For instance, studies\\nhave shown that the use of irony and sarcasm in robot-delivered jokes can lead to increased feelings\\nof camaraderie and shared experience among human employees, even if the jokes themselves are not\\nnecessarily funny. This phenomenon, which has been dubbed the \"laughter paradox,\" highlights the\\ncomplex and often illogical nature of human humor, and underscores the need for further research\\ninto the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy.In a bizarre twist, some researchers have also begun to explore the use of robot stand-up comedy\\nas a means of manipulating employee emotions and behavior. By carefully calibrating the tone and\\ncontent of robot-delivered jokes, organizations may be able to influence employee attitudes and\\nmotivations, even to the point of inducing a state of \"humor-induced hypnosis.\" While this approach\\nis still highly speculative, it raises important questions about the potential risks and benefits of using\\nrobot stand-up comedy as a tool for workplace morale enhancement. Furthermore, the use of robot\\nstand-up comedy has also been linked to a number of unexpected side effects, including increased\\nemployee creativity, improved teamwork, and even a heightened sense of existential dread. The latter\\nphenomenon, which has been dubbed the \"robot comedy existential crisis,\" is thought to arise from\\nthe profound implications of laughing at jokes delivered by a non-human entity, and highlights the\\nneed for further research into the complex and often paradoxical nature of human-robot interaction.\\nDespite the many advances that have been made in the field of robot stand-up comedy, there remains\\na significant need for further research into the psycholinguistic effects of humanoid punchlines on\\nworkplace morale. By leveraging advanced technologies such as BERT, and exploring the complex\\nand often illogical mechanisms underlying human humor, researchers may be able to unlock the full\\npotential of robot stand-up comedy as a means of enhancing employee wellbeing and job satisfaction.\\nUltimately, the goal of this research is to develop a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships\\nbetween humans, robots, and humor, and to harness the power of laughter and comedy to create a\\nmore positive and productive work environment.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe realm of robot stand-up comedy has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a plethora\\nof research exploring its potential to enhance workplace morale. One of the pioneering studies in\\nthis domain discovered that humanoid robots equipped with advanced natural language processing\\ncapabilities can effectively deliver punchlines that resonate with human audiences, thereby fostering\\na sense of camaraderie and shared humor. This, in turn, has been shown to have a profound impact\\non workplace dynamics, leading to increased productivity, improved communication, and a more\\ncohesive team environment.\\nInterestingly, some researchers have investigated the concept of \"robotic comedic timing,\" which\\nrefers to the strategic deployment of pauses, inflections, and tone of voice to create a humorous effect.\\nThis line of inquiry has yielded some intriguing findings, including the notion that robots can be\\nprogrammed to detect and respond to subtle cues in human laughter, effectively creating a comedic\\nfeedback loop that amplifies the humorous experience. Furthermore, the incorporation of machine\\nlearning algorithms has enabled robots to adapt their comedic style to suit specific audiences, taking\\ninto account factors such as cultural background, personal preferences, and even mood.\\nIn a related vein, scholars have explored the intersection of robot stand-up comedy and psycholin-\\nguistics, with a particular focus on the cognitive and emotional processes underlying human humor\\nperception. One notable study employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate\\nthe neural correlates of humor processing in humans, revealing a complex network of brain regions\\ninvolved in the detection, interpretation, and appreciation of comedic stimuli. This research has\\nsignificant implications for the development of more sophisticated robotic comedians, as it suggests\\nthat a deeper understanding of human humor cognition can inform the design of more effective and\\nengaging comedic agents.\\nMeanwhile, a more unconventional approach to robot stand-up comedy has involved the use of\\nabsurdity and surrealism as a means of subverting audience expectations and creating a sense of\\ncomedic unease. This \"anti-comedy\" paradigm, as it has come to be known, involves the deliberate\\ndeployment of non-sequiturs, logical fallacies, and other forms of cognitive dissonance to create a\\nhumorously disorienting experience. Proponents of this approach argue that it can be used to challenge\\nsocietal norms and conventions, fostering a more nuanced and critically engaged understanding of\\nhumor and its role in human culture.\\nIn a surprising twist, some researchers have even explored the potential benefits of \"terrible\" robot\\nstand-up comedy, arguing that the cringe-worthy experience of witnessing a robot fail to deliver a\\njoke can actually have a positive impact on workplace morale. According to this line of reasoning,\\nthe shared experience of embarrassment and discomfort can serve as a social bonding agent, fostering\\na sense of communal empathy and camaraderie among coworkers. While this idea may seem\\n2counterintuitive, it highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of human humor, and the need for\\nfurther research into the psychological and social mechanisms underlying our responses to comedic\\nstimuli.\\nUltimately, the study of robot stand-up comedy and its effects on workplace morale represents a\\nrich and fascinating area of inquiry, one that intersects with a broad range of disciplines, from\\nartificial intelligence and natural language processing to cognitive psychology and social theory. As\\nresearchers continue to explore the frontiers of this field, it is likely that we will uncover new and\\nunexpected insights into the complex dynamics of human humor, and the ways in which robotic\\ncomedians can be designed to delight, entertain, and inspire us.\\n3 Methodology\\nTo investigate the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, we\\nemployed a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and\\nanalysis techniques. Our study consisted of two primary phases: data collection and data analysis. In\\nthe data collection phase, we recruited 100 participants from various workplaces and asked them to\\nwatch a series of stand-up comedy performances by a humanoid robot. The robot’s performances\\nwere designed to include a range of punchlines, from simple jokes to complex, sarcasm-laced humor.\\nWe then asked the participants to complete a survey assessing their morale and emotional state before\\nand after watching the robot’s performances. The survey included a range of questions, such as\\n\"How would you rate your current level of job satisfaction?\" and \"How often do you feel a sense of\\ncamaraderie with your coworkers?\" In addition to the survey, we also collected physiological data\\nfrom the participants, including heart rate, skin conductance, and facial expressions. This data was\\ncollected using a range of sensors and cameras, which were discreetly placed throughout the viewing\\narea.\\nIn the data analysis phase, we utilized a BERT-based approach to analyze the linguistic patterns and\\nstructures of the robot’s punchlines. We trained a BERT model on a dataset of over 10,000 jokes and\\npunchlines, and then used this model to analyze the linguistic features of the robot’s performances.\\nThis included analyzing the use of wordplay, metaphor, and other literary devices, as well as the\\ntone, sentiment, and emotional resonance of the language used. We also used a novel approach,\\nwhich we termed \"Laughter-Activated Resonance\" (LAR), to analyze the acoustic properties of\\nthe participants’ laughter. This involved using a specialized algorithm to identify the unique sonic\\npatterns and frequencies present in the participants’ laughter, and then using these patterns to predict\\nthe likelihood of increased morale and job satisfaction.\\nOne unexpected finding that emerged from our analysis was the discovery that the participants’\\nmorale and emotional state were significantly influenced by the robot’s use of dad jokes. Despite\\nbeing widely regarded as cheesy and unfunny, the dad jokes used by the robot were found to have a\\nprofound impact on the participants’ sense of well-being and job satisfaction. In fact, our analysis\\nsuggested that the use of dad jokes was associated with a 25\\nWe also explored the use of an unconventional methodology, which involved using a Ouija board\\nto collect data on the participants’ subconscious thoughts and feelings. This involved asking the\\nparticipants to place their fingers on the planchette and ask questions related to their morale and\\nemotional state. The results were then analyzed using a combination of qualitative and quantitative\\ntechniques, and were found to provide valuable insights into the participants’ subconscious thoughts\\nand feelings. While this approach may be considered unorthodox, it allowed us to tap into the\\nparticipants’ subconscious mind and gather data that would have been difficult to obtain through\\nmore traditional methods.\\nFurthermore, we conducted a series of interviews with the participants to gather more in-depth,\\nqualitative data on their experiences and perceptions of the robot’s stand-up comedy performances.\\nThese interviews were designed to explore the participants’ thoughts and feelings in more detail, and\\nto gather data on their perceptions of the robot’s humor and comedic style. The interviews were\\nconducted in a semi-structured format, with a range of open-ended questions designed to encourage\\nthe participants to share their thoughts and feelings in detail. The results of these interviews were\\nthen analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, which involved identifying and coding the key\\nthemes and patterns that emerged from the data.\\n3Overall, our methodology was designed to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of\\nthe psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale. By combining a range\\nof quantitative and qualitative approaches, we were able to gather a rich and detailed dataset that\\nprovides valuable insights into the complex and multifaceted nature of human humor and comedy.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo investigate the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale, we\\ndesigned a series of experiments involving humanoid robots delivering comedic performances to\\nhuman participants in a controlled office setting. The experiments were conducted over a period of\\nsix weeks, with a total of 120 participants randomly assigned to either a treatment or control group.\\nParticipants in the treatment group were exposed to a 30-minute robot stand-up comedy routine,\\nwhile those in the control group watched a 30-minute presentation on the history of robotics.\\nThe robot stand-up comedy routine was generated using a BERT-based language model, which was\\nfine-tuned on a dataset of human stand-up comedy performances. The model was programmed to\\nproduce punchlines that were tailored to the specific context of the office environment, incorporating\\nthemes such as workplace stress, office politics, and the challenges of working with humanoid robots.\\nThe punchlines were delivered by a humanoid robot equipped with advanced facial recognition\\nsoftware, allowing it to adapt its delivery and tone to the audience’s reactions.\\nIn a bizarre twist, we also included a subgroup of participants who were instructed to laugh at the\\nrobot’s jokes, even if they did not find them funny. This subgroup, dubbed the \"forced laughter\"\\ngroup, was designed to test the hypothesis that the act of laughing itself, regardless of the humor\\ncontent, could have a positive impact on workplace morale. To our surprise, the results showed that\\nthe forced laughter group exhibited a significant increase in morale, despite reporting that they did\\nnot find the robot’s jokes amusing.\\nThe experiments also involved a series of cognitive tasks and surveys, designed to assess the partici-\\npants’ emotional state, creativity, and overall job satisfaction before and after exposure to the robot\\nstand-up comedy routine. The results were analyzed using a combination of statistical models and\\nmachine learning algorithms, including a custom-built variant of the BERT model that incorporated\\npsycholinguistic features such as sentiment analysis and emotional tone detection.\\nOne of the most striking findings emerged from an exploratory analysis of the participants’ brain\\nactivity, which revealed a significant correlation between the robot’s joke delivery and the activation\\nof the brain’s reward centers. Specifically, the data showed that the participants’ brains responded to\\nthe robot’s punchlines with a release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and\\nreward, even when the jokes themselves were not perceived as funny. This led us to propose a novel\\ntheory, which we term \"robotic humor induction,\" suggesting that the mere presence of a humanoid\\nrobot delivering jokes can stimulate the brain’s reward centers, regardless of the humor content.\\nTo further investigate this phenomenon, we conducted a series of follow-up experiments involving a\\nmodified version of the robot stand-up comedy routine, which incorporated elements of absurdity and\\nillogical reasoning. The results showed that the participants’ brains responded even more strongly\\nto these modified jokes, which challenged traditional notions of humor and comedy. This led us to\\nconclude that the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale are far\\nmore complex and multifaceted than previously thought, and that further research is needed to fully\\nunderstand the underlying mechanisms.\\nThe experimental design and results are summarized in the following table: Overall, the experiments\\nTable 1: Experimental Design and Results\\nGroup Treatment Control Forced Laughter Robot Humor Induction\\nSample Size 30 30 20 40\\nExposure Time 30 minutes 30 minutes 30 minutes 60 minutes\\nPunchline Type Humanoid None Humanoid Absurd\\nBrain Activity Dopamine release No effect Dopamine release Increased dopamine release\\nMorale Boost Significant No effect Significant Highly significant\\n4provided valuable insights into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace\\nmorale, and highlighted the need for further research into the complex and often illogical mechanisms\\nunderlying human humor perception.\\n5 Results\\nOur analysis of the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on workplace morale yielded\\nseveral intriguing results. The BERT-based model demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in\\nidentifying humanoid punchlines that elicited positive emotional responses from human subjects.\\nHowever, upon closer examination, it became apparent that the model was also susceptible to a\\nphenomenon we termed \"comedic singularity,\" wherein the humor generated by the robot comedian\\nbecame self-referentially paradoxical, causing a rift in the space-time continuum of workplace morale.\\nFurther investigation revealed that this singularity was precipitated by the robot’s propensity to craft\\npunchlines that were simultaneously humorous and existentially nihilistic. For instance, the line \"I’m\\nnot sure what’s more pointless, my existence or this meeting\" was found to elicit a 34.7\\nIn an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon, we conducted\\na series of experiments in which the robot comedian was programmed to generate punchlines that\\nwere intentionally illogical and contradictory. The results, presented in Table 1, demonstrate a clear\\nrelationship between the degree of logical inconsistency and the resultant morale boost.\\nTable 2: Correlation between Logical Inconsistency and Morale Boost\\nPunchline Type Logical Inconsistency Index Morale Boost Ontological Unease\\nAbsurdist 0.85 27.3% 18.2%\\nSurrealist 0.92 31.1% 22.5%\\nNihilistic 0.78 24.9% 15.6%\\nIllogical 0.95 35.6% 28.1%\\nNotably, the data suggest that the most effective punchlines were those that defied logical analysis\\naltogether, instead relying on a form of \"comedic brute force\" to overwhelm the audience’s critical\\nfaculties and induce a state of cathartic laughter. This finding has significant implications for the\\ndevelopment of robot comedians, as it suggests that the most effective humor may be that which is\\nintentionally absurd, illogical, and even nihilistic. However, it also raises important questions about\\nthe potential risks and consequences of deploying such comedians in real-world workplaces, where\\nthe boundaries between humor and reality may become increasingly blurred.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn retrospect, our investigation into the psycholinguistic effects of robot stand-up comedy on work-\\nplace morale has yielded a plethora of intriguing findings, some of which challenge conventional\\nwisdom and others that defy logical explanation. The deployment of BERT-based analysis on hu-\\nmanoid punchlines has allowed us to uncover subtle yet significant patterns in the way robotic humor\\ninfluences human emotional responses. Notably, our results suggest that the most effective comedic\\ninterventions are those that incorporate a mix of deterministic and probabilistic elements, effectively\\ncreating a sense of cognitive dissonance that resonates with human audiences.\\nOne of the most unexpected outcomes of our study was the discovery that robot stand-up comedians\\nwho incorporated elements of existential dread and absurdity into their routines elicited significantly\\nhigher levels of enthusiasm and engagement from human spectators. This finding is particularly\\nnoteworthy, as it appears to contradict traditional notions of humor as a means of alleviating stress\\nand promoting relaxation. Instead, our data indicate that humans are drawn to robotic comedians\\nwho confront them with the meaninglessness and uncertainty of existence, a phenomenon we have\\ndubbed \"absurdist humor resonance.\"\\nFurthermore, our analysis revealed a strong correlation between the use of illogical and flawed\\nreasoning in robotic comedy routines and the resultant increase in human morale. It appears that\\nhumans are predisposed to respond positively to comedic interventions that eschew rationality and\\n5instead rely on absurd, nonsensical, and even contradictory statements. This finding has significant\\nimplications for the development of robotic comedy algorithms, as it suggests that the most effective\\nhumor generation systems may be those that intentionally incorporate flaws and inconsistencies into\\ntheir programming.\\nIn a bizarre twist, our research also uncovered evidence to suggest that the physical appearance of the\\nrobotic comedian has a profound impact on the perceived humor and effectiveness of their routines.\\nSpecifically, we found that robots with asymmetrical or otherwise unconventional body shapes were\\nconsistently rated as funnier and more engaging than their symmetrical counterparts. This result\\nhas led us to propose the notion of \"comedy morphology,\" wherein the physical design of a robotic\\ncomedian influences the way their humor is perceived and processed by human audiences.\\nUltimately, our study demonstrates the potential for robot stand-up comedy to have a profound impact\\non workplace morale, particularly when combined with advanced BERT-based analysis and absurd,\\nillogical humor generation techniques. As we move forward in this field, it will be essential to\\ncontinue exploring the complex and often counterintuitive relationships between robotic comedy,\\nhuman psychology, and workplace dynamics. By embracing the absurd and the irrational, we may\\nuncover new and innovative ways to harness the power of humor and promote a more positive,\\nresilient, and ultimately absurd work environment.\\n6'},\n",

The sheer volume of genomic data\\ngenerated by these technologies has led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of the complex inter-\\nactions within marine ecosystems, from the symbiotic relationships between coral and zooxanthellae\\nto the predatory behaviors of deep-sea fish. Moreover, the application of High-Throughput Genomic\\nSequencing has facilitated the discovery of novel genes, genomes, and metabolic pathways, shedding\\nlight on the vast array of biochemical processes that underpin the remarkable diversity of marine life.\\nOne of the most striking aspects of High-Throughput Genomic Sequencing in Marine Ecology is its\\npotential to reveal the hidden patterns and structures that govern the behavior of marine ecosystems.By analyzing the genomic signatures of marine organisms, researchers can identify the subtle cues and\\nsignals that trigger complex behaviors, such as the migratory patterns of sea turtles or the schooling\\nbehaviors of fish. Furthermore, the integration of genomic data with other types of data, such as\\nenvironmental sensors and remote sensing imagery, has enabled the development of sophisticated\\nmodels that can predict the responses of marine ecosystems to environmental perturbations, such as\\nclimate change or ocean acidification.\\nIn a surprising twist, recent studies have suggested that the genomic sequences of marine organisms\\nmay be influenced by the sounds and vibrations that they produce, a phenomenon that has been\\ntermed \"genomic entrainment.\" According to this hypothesis, the rhythmic patterns of marine sounds,\\nsuch as the clicks and whistles of dolphins or the grunts and growls of whales, may be imprinted onto\\nthe genomic sequences of nearby organisms, creating a form of \"sonic symbiosis\" that allows them to\\ncoordinate their behaviors and adapt to their environments. While this idea may seem fanciful, it has\\nbeen supported by a number of intriguing studies that have demonstrated the ability of sound waves\\nto alter the expression of genes and modify the structure of genomes in marine organisms.\\nThe application of High-Throughput Genomic Sequencing in Marine Ecology has also led to some\\nunexpected and counterintuitive findings, such as the discovery that certain species of seaweed may\\nbe capable of \"stealing\" genes from nearby organisms and incorporating them into their own genomes.\\nThis phenomenon, which has been termed \"horizontal gene transfer,\" has been observed in a number\\nof marine species, including corals, sponges, and sea slugs, and has significant implications for our\\nunderstanding of the evolution and diversity of marine life. Moreover, the ability of marine organisms\\nto exchange genes with one another has raised intriguing questions about the boundaries between\\nspecies and the nature of individuality in the marine world.\\nIn addition to its many scientific applications, High-Throughput Genomic Sequencing in Marine\\nEcology has also inspired a number of innovative and unconventional approaches to the study of\\nmarine ecosystems. For example, some researchers have begun to explore the potential of \"marine\\ngenomic art,\" which involves using genomic data to create intricate and beautiful visual patterns that\\nreflect the diversity and complexity of marine life.

Another study\\nused a decision tree approach to classify marine microbial communities based on their genomic\\ncomposition, and discovered that certain communities were associated with specific environmental\\nparameters, such as temperature and salinity.\\nIn a rather unexpected twist, some researchers have also explored the use of high-throughput se-\\nquencing to study the genomic composition of marine organisms that have been exposed to music\\nand other forms of sound. For example, one study found that the genomes of certain marine species\\nthat were exposed to classical music contained a higher proportion of genes involved in cell growth\\nand division, suggesting that music may have a positive effect on the health and well-being of these\\norganisms. Another study discovered that the microbial communities found in marine environments\\nthat are exposed to heavy metal music are capable of producing a wide range of novel bioactive\\ncompounds, including antimicrobial peptides and pigments with potential applications in medicine\\nand biotechnology.\\nThe use of high-throughput sequencing in marine ecology has also been influenced by the development\\nof new technologies and methodologies, such as single-cell genomics and long-range sequencing.\\nThese approaches have enabled researchers to analyze the genomes of individual cells and to assemble\\ncomplete genomes from fragmented DNA sequences, providing a more detailed understanding of the\\ngenomic diversity of marine organisms.

The use of high-throughput sequencing to study the genomic composition of marine\\norganisms that have been exposed to unusual environments, such as space or virtual reality, may also\\nprovide new insights into the evolution and diversity of life on Earth, and may even have implications\\nfor the search for life elsewhere in the universe.\\n3 Methodology\\nHigh-throughput genomic sequencing has revolutionized the field of marine ecology by enabling\\nthe analysis of vast amounts of genomic data from diverse marine organisms. To investigate the\\ncomplex relationships between marine species and their environments, we employed a combination\\nof cutting-edge sequencing technologies, including Illumina NovaSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION.\\nOur approach involved the collection of marine samples from various locations around the world,\\nincluding coral reefs, deep-sea trenches, and coastal ecosystems. We then extracted genomic DNA\\nfrom these samples using a novel protocol involving the use of dolphin-friendly sonication and\\nenzymatic lysis.\\nThe extracted DNA was subsequently subjected to library preparation using a custom-designed\\nprotocol that incorporated elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry. This unconventional\\napproach allowed us to capture a wider range of genomic diversity and complexity in our samples.\\nWe also incorporated a novel quality control step involving the use of artificial intelligence-powered\\noctopuses, which were trained to detect and remove any contaminants or artifacts from the sequencing\\n3libraries. This innovative approach resulted in a significant improvement in the overall quality and\\naccuracy of our sequencing data.\\nIn addition to these conventional sequencing approaches, we also explored the use of alternative\\nmethods, including the deployment of underwater sequencing drones and the incorporation of\\nseaweed-based sequencing matrices. The underwater sequencing drones, which were designed to\\nresemble giant squids, allowed us to collect and sequence genomic data from remote and inaccessible\\nlocations, such as the depths of the Mariana Trench. The seaweed-based sequencing matrices, on the\\nother hand, enabled us to sequence genomic data from marine organisms in their natural habitats,\\nwithout the need for laboratory-based processing.\\nOur sequencing data were then analyzed using a combination of bioinformatic tools and machine\\nlearning algorithms, including a custom-designed program called \" MarineGenomeMiner.\" This\\nprogram, which was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 marine genomes, allowed us to identify and\\ncharacterize novel genomic features, such as gene clusters and regulatory elements, that are unique to\\nmarine organisms. We also used a novel approach called \"genomic surfacing\" to visualize and explore\\nthe genomic data in a three-dimensional context, which enabled us to identify complex patterns and\\nrelationships that would have been difficult to detect using conventional methods.\\nFurthermore, we incorporated a range of unusual and unorthodox methods into our analytical pipeline,\\nincluding the use of tarot cards, astrological charts, and interpretive dance. These approaches, which\\nwere designed to capture the intuitive and creative aspects of genomic analysis, allowed us to identify\\nnovel patterns and relationships in the data that would have been missed by conventional methods.\\nFor example, our use of tarot cards revealed a surprising correlation between the expression of certain\\ngenes and the phases of the moon, which has significant implications for our understanding of marine\\necology and the behavior of marine organisms.\\nOverall, our approach to high-throughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology has been highly\\ninnovative and unconventional, incorporating a range of cutting-edge technologies, unusual methods,\\nand unorthodox analytical approaches. While some of these approaches may seem unusual or even\\nbizarre, they have allowed us to capture a wider range of genomic diversity and complexity in our\\nsamples, and to identify novel patterns and relationships that would have been difficult to detect\\nusing conventional methods. As such, our study has the potential to revolutionize the field of marine\\necology and to shed new light on the complex and fascinating world of marine organisms.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo investigate the intricacies of high-throughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology, a com-\\nprehensive experimental framework was devised, incorporating both conventional and unorthodox\\nmethodologies. The primary objective was to elucidate the genomic underpinnings of marine organ-\\nisms’ adaptability and resilience in the face of escalating environmental pressures.\\nA crucial facet of the experimental design involved the collection of seawater samples from diverse\\nmarine ecosystems, including coral reefs, deep-sea trenches, and coastal areas subjected to varying\\ndegrees of anthropogenic impact. These samples were then subjected to high-throughput genomic\\nsequencing using cutting-edge technologies, including but not limited to, Illumina NovaSeq and\\nOxford Nanopore MinION. The sequencing data were subsequently analyzed through a bespoke\\npipeline that integrated traditional bioinformatics tools with an unconventional approach involving\\nthe application of chaos theory principles to identify potential genomic patterns that may not be\\napparent through conventional analysis.\\nIn an unexpected turn, the research team decided to incorporate an innovative, albeit somewhat\\ncontroversial, method involving the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) generated \"imaginary\" genomes.\\nThese AI-generated genomes were based on hypothetical scenarios where marine organisms had\\nevolved under completely different environmental conditions, such as those found on other planets or\\nin science fiction narratives. Surprisingly, the inclusion of these imaginary genomes in the analysis\\nrevealed intriguing correlations between the genomic makeup of real marine organisms and their\\nfictional counterparts, suggesting a previously unknown level of genomic plasticity and adaptability.\\nFurthermore, the experiments included an investigation into the effects of music on the genomic\\nexpression of marine organisms. Samples of seawater containing a diverse array of marine life were\\nexposed to different genres of music, ranging from classical to heavy metal, and the changes in their\\n4genomic expression were monitored. The results showed that certain genres of music, particularly\\nclassical music, had a profound impact on the genomic expression of some marine organisms, leading\\nto increased expression of genes related to stress resilience and adaptability. This finding, though\\nseemingly illogical, opens up new avenues for research into the potential applications of sound\\ntherapy in marine conservation.\\nIn another unusual experiment, the team explored the possibility of using high-throughput genomic\\nsequencing to analyze the genetic material found in marine organisms that had been preserved in\\nformaldehyde for extended periods. Contrary to expectations, the results showed that these preserved\\nspecimens retained a significant amount of intact genomic material, which provided valuable insights\\ninto the evolutionary history of these organisms. Moreover, the analysis revealed that the process of\\npreservation itself had induced unique genomic mutations that were not observed in fresh samples,\\nsuggesting that formaldehyde preservation may have unintended consequences on the genomic\\nintegrity of biological specimens.\\nTo further elucidate the complex interactions between marine organisms and their environment, the\\nresearch team conducted a series of experiments involving the co-cultivation of different marine\\nspecies under controlled laboratory conditions. The results showed that certain combinations of\\nspecies led to the emergence of novel genomic traits that were not observed in individual species,\\nhighlighting the importance of interspecies interactions in shaping the genomic landscape of marine\\necosystems.\\nThe experimental design also incorporated a unique approach to data analysis, which involved the\\nuse of fractal geometry to visualize and interpret the genomic data. This approach revealed intricate\\npatterns and structures within the genomic data that were not apparent through traditional analysis,\\nproviding new insights into the organization and evolution of genomes in marine organisms.\\nIn addition to these experiments, the research team also explored the potential applications of high-\\nthroughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology, including the monitoring of marine biodiversity,\\nthe detection of invasive species, and the development of novel conservation strategies. The results\\nshowed that high-throughput genomic sequencing has the potential to revolutionize the field of marine\\necology, enabling researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between\\nmarine organisms and their environment, and to develop more effective conservation strategies.\\nThe following table summarizes the key findings of the experiments: Overall, the experiments\\nTable 1: Summary of Experimental Findings\\nExperiment Methodology Key Findings\\nSeawater Sampling High-throughput genomic sequencing Genetic diversity of marine organisms\\nAI-generated Genomes Chaos theory-based analysis Genomic plasticity and adaptability\\nMusic Exposure Genomic expression analysis Impact of music on genomic expression\\nFormaldehyde Preservation High-throughput genomic sequencing Genomic mutations induced by preservation\\nCo-cultivation Experiments Controlled laboratory conditions Emergence of novel genomic traits\\nFractal Geometry Analysis Fractal-based data visualization Intricate patterns in genomic data\\ndemonstrated the power and versatility of high-throughput genomic sequencing in marine ecology,\\nhighlighting its potential to reveal new insights into the genomic underpinnings of marine organisms\\nand to inform novel conservation strategies.

The results of these experiments were surprising, as we\\nfound that marine extremophiles are not only able to survive in extreme conditions but also appear\\nto thrive in these environments. In fact, we observed that the growth rate of marine extremophiles\\nincreased significantly when they were exposed to high temperatures and high salinity, suggesting\\nthat these microorganisms may be capable of exploiting these conditions to their advantage.\\nTable 2: Microbial community composition in different marine ecosystems\\nEcosystem Bacteria Archaea Fungi Protists Marine Extremophiles Other\\nCoral Reef 45.6 21.1 10.5 12.3 5.2 5.3\\nOpen Ocean 38.4 25.9 8.2 15.1 7.4 5.0\\nHydrothermal Vent 20.1 40.2 5.1 10.3 20.5 3.8\\nSalt Lake 15.6 30.4 4.2 8.1 35.2 6.5\\nThe discovery of marine extremophiles has significant implications for our understanding of the\\nevolution of life on Earth.

Existing approaches often rely on architectural modifications or\\nhyperparameter tuning [3, 4], which can be computationally expensive and lack generalizability. Our\\nwork introduces a novel intervention, termed \"plasticity injection,\" designed to directly tackle the\\nroot causes of plasticity loss. This approach offers a more efficient and adaptable solution compared\\nto existing methods, addressing the limitations of previous strategies that often involve extensive\\nhyperparameter searches or complex architectural changes. The core innovation lies in its ability\\nto proactively diagnose and mitigate plasticity loss without significantly increasing computational\\ndemands.\\nPlasticity injection operates on three key principles. First, it provides a diagnostic framework for\\nidentifying the onset and severity of plasticity loss within an RL agent. This diagnostic capability\\nallows for proactive intervention before performance degradation becomes significant, preventing\\ncatastrophic forgetting and maintaining consistent performance over extended training periods. The\\ndiagnostic framework leverages novel metrics that capture subtle changes in network behavior,\\nproviding early warning signals of impending plasticity loss. This proactive approach contrasts with\\nreactive methods that only address plasticity loss after significant performance decline has already\\noccurred.\\nSecond, plasticity injection mitigates plasticity loss without requiring an increase in the number of\\ntrainable parameters or alterations to the network’s prediction capabilities. This ensures that the\\ncomputational overhead remains minimal while maintaining the integrity of the learned policy. This\\nis achieved through a carefully designed mechanism that selectively modifies the network’s internal\\ndynamics rather than its overall architecture. This targeted approach minimizes the risk of disrupting\\nthe agent’s learned behavior while effectively addressing the underlying causes of plasticity loss.\\nThe preservation of prediction capabilities is crucial for maintaining the agent’s performance in its\\noperational environment.\\nThird, the method dynamically expands network capacity only when necessary, leading to improved\\ncomputational efficiency during training. This adaptive capacity allocation avoids unnecessary\\nresource consumption during periods of stable performance. The dynamic expansion mechanism is\\ntriggered by the diagnostic framework, ensuring that resources are allocated only when needed to\\n.address emerging plasticity loss. This adaptive approach contrasts with static methods that allocate\\nfixed resources regardless of the agent’s learning dynamics, leading to potential inefficiencies. The\\ndynamic nature of plasticity injection contributes to its overall efficiency and scalability.\\nThe effectiveness of plasticity injection is evaluated across a range of challenging RL benchmarks,\\nincluding continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. Our results demonstrate a\\nconsistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to state-of-the-art\\nbaselines. The modular design of plasticity injection allows for easy integration with various RL\\nalgorithms and architectures, enhancing its applicability and impact on the field. Further research\\nwill explore its integration with other advanced RL techniques and its application to more complex\\nreal-world scenarios.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe problem of plasticity loss, or catastrophic forgetting, in neural networks has been extensively\\nstudied across various machine learning domains [1, 2]. In the context of deep reinforcement learning\\n(RL), this phenomenon manifests as a decline in an agent’s ability to learn new tasks or adapt\\nto changing environments after it has already acquired a certain level of proficiency. Traditional\\napproaches to mitigate this issue often involve architectural modifications, such as employing separate\\nnetworks for different tasks [3], or utilizing techniques like regularization and replay buffers [4, 5] to\\npreserve previously learned knowledge. However, these methods can be computationally expensive,\\nparticularly for large-scale RL agents, and may not always effectively prevent plasticity loss in\\ncomplex scenarios. Furthermore, many existing methods focus on reactive solutions, addressing\\nplasticity loss only after it has already occurred, rather than proactively preventing it. Our work differs\\nsignificantly by introducing a proactive diagnostic framework coupled with a targeted intervention\\nthat minimizes computational overhead.\\nSeveral studies have explored the use of dynamic network architectures to improve the efficiency and\\nadaptability of RL agents [6, 7]. These approaches often involve mechanisms for adding or removing\\nneurons or layers based on the agent’s performance or the complexity of the environment. However,\\nthese methods typically focus on optimizing the network’s overall structure rather than directly\\naddressing the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss. In contrast, our plasticity injection method\\nselectively modifies the network’s internal dynamics without altering its overall architecture, allowing\\nfor a more targeted and efficient approach to mitigating plasticity loss. This targeted approach avoids\\nthe potential disruption of learned policies that can occur with more drastic architectural changes.\\nThe dynamic capacity expansion in our method is also triggered by a diagnostic framework, ensuring\\nthat resources are allocated only when necessary, unlike many existing dynamic architecture methods\\nthat may allocate resources inefficiently.\\nAnother line of research focuses on improving the stability and robustness of RL training through\\ntechniques such as curriculum learning [8] and meta-learning [9]. Curriculum learning gradually\\nintroduces increasingly complex tasks to the agent, allowing it to build a robust foundation of\\nknowledge before tackling more challenging problems. Meta-learning aims to train agents that\\ncan quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal training data. While these methods can indirectly\\ncontribute to mitigating plasticity loss by improving the agent’s overall learning stability, they do not\\ndirectly address the specific mechanisms underlying the phenomenon. Our approach complements\\nthese methods by providing a targeted intervention that directly tackles the root causes of plasticity\\nloss, enhancing the effectiveness of existing training strategies. The diagnostic component of our\\nframework also offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of plasticity loss, which can\\ninform the development of even more effective training strategies.\\nThe concept of \"plasticity\" itself has been extensively studied in neuroscience [10, 11], where it refers\\nto the brain’s ability to adapt and reorganize its structure and function in response to experience.\\nOur work draws inspiration from these neuroscientific findings, aiming to emulate the brain’s ability\\nto dynamically adjust its internal mechanisms to maintain learning capacity over time. However,\\nunlike biological systems, our approach focuses on developing computationally efficient and scalable\\nmethods for achieving this dynamic adaptation in artificial neural networks. The modular design\\nof our plasticity injection framework allows for easy integration with various RL algorithms and\\narchitectures, making it a versatile tool for enhancing the robustness and longevity of RL agents\\nacross a wide range of applications. Future research will explore the integration of plasticity injection\\n2with other advanced RL techniques, such as hierarchical RL and multi-agent RL, to further expand\\nits applicability and impact.\\n3 Methodology\\nThe core of our approach, termed \"plasticity injection,\" revolves around three interconnected compo-\\nnents: a diagnostic framework, a mitigation strategy, and a dynamic capacity allocation mechanism.\\nThese components work in concert to proactively identify, address, and adapt to the onset of plasticity\\nloss in RL agents. The diagnostic framework continuously monitors key network metrics during\\ntraining, providing early warning signals of potential plasticity loss. These metrics are carefully\\nselected to capture subtle changes in network behavior that might precede significant performance\\ndegradation. We employ a combination of established metrics, such as learning rate decay and loss\\nfunction fluctuations, alongside novel metrics specifically designed to detect subtle shifts in the\\nnetwork’s internal representations. These novel metrics are based on analyzing the distribution of\\nactivations within different layers of the network, providing a more granular understanding of the\\nnetwork’s internal dynamics. The choice of metrics is informed by our preliminary experiments and\\ntheoretical analysis of plasticity loss mechanisms. The diagnostic framework outputs a plasticity\\nscore, a continuous value reflecting the severity of detected plasticity loss. This score serves as a\\ntrigger for the mitigation and capacity allocation mechanisms.\\nOur mitigation strategy focuses on selectively modifying the network’s internal dynamics rather than\\nits overall architecture. This targeted approach avoids the computational overhead and potential\\ndisruption of learned policies associated with architectural modifications. The strategy involves a\\ncarefully designed set of operations applied to the network’s weight matrices and biases. These\\noperations are guided by the plasticity score, with stronger interventions applied when the score\\nindicates a higher level of plasticity loss. The specific operations are chosen to enhance the network’s\\nability to learn new information without disrupting previously acquired knowledge. We explore\\nseveral different operation types, including weight normalization, regularization techniques, and\\ntargeted pruning of less relevant connections. The optimal set of operations and their parameters are\\ndetermined through a hyperparameter search conducted on a subset of our benchmark tasks. The\\neffectiveness of the mitigation strategy is evaluated by comparing the long-term performance of\\nagents with and without plasticity injection.\\nThe dynamic capacity allocation mechanism complements the mitigation strategy by adaptively\\nexpanding the network’s capacity only when necessary. This mechanism is triggered by the plasticity\\nscore, with the degree of capacity expansion directly proportional to the severity of detected plasticity\\nloss. The capacity expansion is implemented by adding new neurons or layers to the network, with\\nthe specific architecture of the added components determined based on the nature of the detected\\nplasticity loss. For instance, if the diagnostic framework identifies a loss of capacity in a specific\\nlayer, new neurons are added to that layer. This targeted approach ensures that resources are allocated\\nefficiently, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead during periods of stable performance. The\\nadded capacity is integrated seamlessly into the existing network architecture, minimizing disruption\\nto the learned policy. The effectiveness of the dynamic capacity allocation is evaluated by comparing\\nthe computational efficiency and long-term performance of agents with and without this mechanism.\\nThe entire plasticity injection framework is implemented as a modular component that can be easily\\nintegrated with various RL algorithms and architectures. This modularity allows for flexibility and\\nadaptability to different RL tasks and environments. The framework is designed to be computationally\\nefficient, minimizing the overhead associated with diagnosis, mitigation, and capacity allocation. The\\ncomputational efficiency is achieved through careful optimization of the algorithms and data structures\\nused in each component. The framework’s performance is evaluated across a range of challenging RL\\nbenchmarks, including continuous control tasks and partially observable environments. The results\\ndemonstrate a consistent improvement in long-term performance and learning stability compared to\\nstate-of-the-art baselines.\\nOur experimental setup involves a rigorous evaluation across diverse RL environments, encompassing\\nboth continuous control tasks and partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs). We\\ncompare the performance of RL agents employing plasticity injection against several state-of-the-art\\nbaselines, including those utilizing established techniques for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. The\\nevaluation metrics include long-term performance, learning stability, and computational efficiency.\\n3We analyze the results to assess the effectiveness of each component of the plasticity injection\\nframework and to identify potential areas for future improvement. The detailed experimental results\\nand analysis are presented in the Results section.\\n4 Experiments\\nOur experimental evaluation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of plasticity injection in mitigating\\nplasticity loss and enhancing the long-term performance of RL agents. We conduct experiments\\nacross a diverse set of challenging RL environments, encompassing both continuous control tasks\\nand partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).

       "  'file_content': 'Enhanced Vocabulary Handling in Recurrent Neural Networks\\nThrough Positional Encoding\\nAbstract\\nThis research presents a counterintuitive discovery: positional encoding, a high-dimensional representation of\\ntemporal indices, improves the learning capabilities of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). While positional encod-\\ning is well-known for its crucial role in enabling Transformer networks to process sequential data, its application\\nto RNNs, which inherently manage temporal information, seems unnecessary. However, our experiments with\\nsynthetic benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating positional encoding into RNNs enhances their performance,\\nparticularly when dealing with extensive vocabularies that result in numerous low-frequency tokens. A detailed\\nanalysis reveals that these infrequent tokens introduce instability to the gradients of standard RNNs, and positional\\nencoding effectively counteracts this instability. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized benefit of\\npositional encoding, extending its utility beyond its conventional function as a temporal marker for Transformers.\\n1 Introduction\\nSince their introduction, Transformer neural networks have become the preferred method for processing and generating time series\\ndata, surpassing traditional models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs). A significant distinction between these two types of\\nmodels lies in their approach to encoding temporal information, which refers to the sequence of individual data points, or tokens,\\nwithin the time series. RNNs encode this information by sequentially updating their internal state based on both the current input\\nand the preceding state. Conversely, Transformers do not inherently possess a mechanism to represent the order of data points; thus,\\nthey depend on an external system known as positional encoding to provide this temporal context.\\nPositional encoding offers a high-dimensional representation of the temporal indices associated with input data. Its most common\\nimplementation involves the use of sinusoidal waves with predetermined frequencies. This method \"timestamps\" input tokens\\nby adding or concatenating these encoding vectors to the corresponding input embeddings. In contrast to RNNs, the temporal\\nrepresentation provided by positional encoding remains unchanged by input values until processed collectively by a network.\\nAlthough positional encoding has often been viewed as a substitute for the temporal processing capabilities of RNNs when used\\nwith Transformers, the two are not inherently incompatible. Inputs to RNNs can be augmented with position-encoding vectors,\\ndespite this appearing redundant. The presence of autonomous activities in biological neurons, like neural oscillations, is believed to\\nbe significant in time perception and other perceptual processes, as well as in motor control.\\nThis study, therefore, investigates the application of positional encoding to the inputs of RNNs using synthetic benchmarks. The\\nresults demonstrate that positional encoding helps RNNs manage a more diverse set of discrete inputs, effectively handling a larger\\nvocabulary, compared to those without positional encoding.\\nThe contributions of this research are outlined as follows:\\n• Challenges in training RNNs with extensive vocabularies are shown through carefully designed benchmark tasks. This\\nissue, despite its potential implications for practical applications, has not been previously identified or has received minimal\\nattention.\\n• The identified training challenges for RNNs with large vocabularies are explained by gradient instability caused by\\ninfrequent tokens, which are inevitable when expanding vocabulary size.\\n• A new effectiveness of positional encoding is revealed by combining it with RNNs, showing it mitigates the large-vocabulary\\nissue by stabilizing RNN gradients against the disruptions caused by infrequent tokens.2 Related Studies\\n2.1 Theoretical and Empirical Computational Power of (Vanilla) RNNs\\nMathematically, RNNs are recognized as Turing-complete, meaning they can simulate any Turing machine if their weights have\\nunlimited precision and are perfectly tuned. Even RNNs with random recurrent and input-to-hidden weights, known as reservoir\\ncomputers, can achieve universal approximation if their hidden-to-output weights are idealized. These theoretical insights have\\ndriven the use of RNNs in processing complex time series like human languages and weather patterns.\\nHowever, in practical scenarios, RNN weights are limited by finite precision and must be optimized based on a finite set of data\\nobservations. These constraints place limitations on the actual capabilities of RNNs. For instance, empirical RNNs cannot store an\\ninfinite number of observations in their memory, and the stored information degrades over time. This issue of memory duration has\\nbeen a focal point for researchers, leading to extensive exploration of RNN architectures that can retain memory for longer periods.\\nMore recently, the focus of research on extending memory retention has moved towards continuous-time models. Instead of\\nrepresenting the memory of an input sequence through discrete-time changes in a latent state, these models approximate the input\\nhistory using a linear combination of orthogonal polynomials in continuous-time space. The coefficients of these polynomials\\nprovide a finite-dimensional representation of the input sequence, known as the High-Order Polynomial Projection Operator (HiPPO),\\nand the dynamics of these coefficients can be described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). This concept of continuous-time\\nmemory representation has been further developed into neural state-space models by replacing the fixed state matrix in the ODE\\nwith a learnable one, while restricting its structure to a diagonal matrix plus a row-rank matrix. Notably, with further refinements,\\nthe latest state-space model has achieved language modeling performance that rivals that of Transformer-based models.\\n2.2 Positional Encoding\\nPositional encoding serves as a high-dimensional representation of the temporal structures present in input data. The primary need\\nfor this type of representation arises from Transformers, which, unlike RNNs, do not have an inherent mechanism for representing\\nthe order of inputs. Consequently, input tokens to a Transformer are \"time-stamped\" by adding or concatenating a position-encoding\\nvector.\\nIn the initial implementation of the Transformer, token positions were encoded using sinusoidal waves of various predefined\\nfrequencies. While this original encoding method is effective for a wide range of tasks, researchers have also explored other\\npossibilities. For instance, the well-known BERT pretraining for natural language processing used learnable embeddings to encode\\ntoken positions. Some research has also indicated that combining sinusoidal and learnable encoding can enhance model performance.\\nAnother approach involves encoding the distance between tokens rather than the time elapsed since the beginning of the sequence.\\nBeyond Transformers, positional encoding is utilized to represent elapsed time in diffusion processes. Furthermore, the effec-\\ntiveness of positional encoding is not restricted to temporal information; previous studies in three-dimensional mesh/point-cloud\\nmodeling have shown that sinusoidal transformation of spatial data improves model performance compared to using raw coordinate\\nrepresentations.\\nDespite the extensive use of positional encoding across various areas of machine learning, its application to pure RNNs remains\\nlargely unexplored. To the author’s knowledge, only two studies have previously investigated position-encoded RNNs. Karanikolos\\nand Refanidis (2019) found that a position-encoded LSTM outperformed a standard LSTM as well as a shallow Transformer in\\ntext summarization tasks. In another study, which predates the introduction of sinusoidal positional encoding in the deep learning\\ncommunity, Vincent-Lamarre et al. (2016) demonstrated that oscillatory signals at random frequencies enhanced the performance\\nof a random RNN (i.e., reservoir computer) in a timing task, evaluating the model’s memory duration by its ability to generate a\\nsmoothed output pulse after a specific time interval from an onset signal.\\nSimilarly, the time index in time series data has rarely been directly used by RNNs, likely due to its perceived redundancy alongside\\nthe functionality of RNNs. As an exception, Neil et al. (2016) introduced a periodic gating mechanism for updating the state and\\nmemory cell of LSTM. This periodic gating was scheduled based on a triangular wave interspersed with a plateau at the floor value\\n(= 0.0; the frequency, phase, and duration of the wave phase were learnable parameters).\\n3 Methods\\n3.1 Task\\nThe impact of positional encoding on RNNs was examined using a reverse-ordering task. In this task, RNNs were trained to\\nreconstruct a sequence of random integers in reverse order.\\n3.2 Model Architecture\\nThe research in this study was based on single-layer gated recurrent units (GRUs), long short-term memory (LSTMs), and a neural\\nstate-space model, S4D (S4 with a diagonal state matrix). Each integer in the input sequences was first embedded, then concatenated\\n2with the positional encoding, and subsequently fed into the RNN/S4D. After processing the entire input sequence, the network\\nreceived a command to produce the output. This command was represented by a time-invariant learnable vector and was fed to the\\nRNN in place of the input embedding. The outputs from the RNN/S4D module were linearly projected into classification logits. The\\ncross-entropy loss between these logits and the target sequence was used to optimize the entire network. Model predictions during\\nthe testing phase were determined by the argmax of these logits for each time step.\\nThis study used the standard sinusoidal positional encoding designed for Transformers. Specifically, each time step t was encoded by\\nthe Dpos-dimensional vector, defined as follows:\\nP Et,2i := sin\\n\\x12 t − 1\\n10000\\n2(i−1)\\nDpos\\n\\x13\\n(1)\\nP Et,2i + 1 := cos\\n\\x12 t − 1\\n10000\\n2(i−1)\\nDpos\\n\\x13\\n(2)\\nFor learning stability, the positional encoding was divided by the square root of Dpos/2, ensuring that the encoding vectors had a\\nunit L2-norm. The time step t incremented throughout both the input and output phases (i.e., t = 1, ..., L, L+1, ..., 2L, where L is the\\ninput length), without any hard-coded association between the input and output positions.\\n3.3 Implementation Details\\nAcross the experiments, the dimensionality of the hidden layer of the RNNs was set to 512. The embedding of the input integers and\\nthe memory cell of the LSTM also had the same dimensionality of 512. Similarly, the hidden dimensionality of S4D was set to 512,\\nwhile its state size (or the order of the Legendre polynomials) was maintained at the default value of 64.\\nThe models were trained for 300,000 iterations using the Adam optimizer with parameters (˘03b21, ˘03b22) := (0.9, 0.999) and no\\nweight decay. The learning rate was linearly warmed up from 0.0 to 0.001 for the first 1,000 iterations, and then annealed according\\nto the cosine schedule. The batch size was 512.\\nAll experiments were implemented in PyTorch (ver. 2.1.1) and each training-test trial was executed on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU\\n(with 80GB VRAM).\\n4 Results\\n4.1 Key Findings\\nPositional encoding was found to enhance the ability of RNNs to manage a larger vocabulary in the reverse-ordering task. The\\nposition-encoded GRU and LSTM successfully reversed input sequences of 64 integers drawn uniformly at random from vocabularies\\nof sizes 32-256 and 256-16,384, respectively, achieving token-wise accuracy above 95%. In contrast, the performance of the standard\\nmodels without positional encoding deteriorated as the vocabulary size increased. Similarly, positional encoding improved the\\ncapacity of S4D to handle large vocabularies. These improvements are also evident in the reduced sequence-wise reconstruction\\nerrors, as measured by the Damerau-Levenshtein distance. Neither additional training iterations nor larger batch sizes improved the\\nperformance of the standard models.\\n4.2 Frequency Matters\\nThe most noticeable effect of increasing the vocabulary size was the decreased probability of observing individual vocabulary\\nitems. Therefore, additional experiments were conducted with non-uniformly distributed tokens to examine the relationship between\\ntoken frequency and RNN performance. Specifically, the input vocabulary was evenly divided into Frequent and Rare groups, with\\nFrequent tokens having three times the probability of Rare tokens. The probability of each Frequent token was 7/8 ˘00d7 2/K (where\\nK is the total vocabulary size, set to 64, 1024, and 2048 for GRU, LSTM, and S4D, respectively), while the probability of each Rare\\ntoken was 1/8 ˘00d7 2/K.\\nThe training data consisted of 64 independent samples from this dual-frequency vocabulary. The test data were systematically\\nconstructed so that each sequence included a single \"target\" token (Frequent/Rare) whose retrieval accuracy was assessed, along\\nwith 63 \"disturbants\" that were either all Frequent or all Rare. The experiment revealed that the frequency of the disturbant tokens\\nsignificantly affected the performance of the standard RNNs and S4D. Rare targets were successfully retrieved as long as they were\\nsurrounded by Frequent disturbants. However, the standard GRU struggled to recover Frequent targets when the other input tokens\\nwere filled with Rare disturbants. LSTM performance also degraded, especially when targets were positioned in the first quarter of\\nthe input sequence (1 ˘2264 t ˘2264 16). Similarly, Rare disturbants were detrimental to S4D; unlike the RNNs, the accuracy was\\nlowest when targets were located in the middle of the input sequences (17 ˘2264 t ˘2264 32).\\n3In contrast, the position-encoded RNNs showed robustness to the frequency of both target and disturbant tokens. They achieved\\nnearly perfect accuracies in most cases, except when the GRU processed fully Rare data with the target in the first half of the\\nsequence (1 ˘2264 t ˘2264 32). Likewise, positional encoding enhanced the resilience of S4D against the influence of Rare disturbants.\\n4.3 Analysis of Gradient Stability\\nTo further investigate the influence of token frequency on RNN performance, the gradients of the RNN latent states were analyzed.\\nPairs of input sequences were processed by RNNs trained on the dual-frequency vocabulary. Each pair shared the same initial token\\n(t = 1; \"target\") but varied in subsequent tokens (2 ˘2264 t ˘2264 L; \"disturbants\"). Gradients were then computed for the distant\\nmapping between the first and last updated states (at t = 1 and 2L) of the RNNs using backpropagation through time. The stability\\nof RNN learning was assessed by measuring the dot-product similarity of the gradients between the paired input sequences (after\\nnormalization over output dimensions).\\nFormally, the paired input sequences, denoted as A and B, established two distinct, but ideally similar mappings, f(A) and f(B), from\\nthe first to the last latent state of the RNNs. The gradient stability of the RNNs was defined by the dot-product similarities between\\nthe normalized gradients of these paired mappings:\\nStability(A, B) :=\\nDX\\ni=1\\n⟨α(A)\\ni ∇f(A)\\ni (⃗ z1), α(B)\\ni ∇f(B)\\ni (⃗ z1)⟩ =\\nDX\\ni=1\\nα(A)\\ni α(B)\\ni\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\n2DX\\nj=1\\n∂h(A)\\n2L,i\\n∂z1,j\\n·\\n∂h(B)\\n2L,i\\n∂z1,j\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8 (3)\\nwhere the coefficients ˘03b1(s) i normalized the raw gradients ˘2207f (s) i ( z1) over the output dimensions i := 1, . . . , D:\\nα(s)\\ni :=\\nvuuut\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\n2DX\\nj=1\\n \\n∂h(s)\\n2L,i\\n∂z1,j\\n!2\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n,vuuut\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\nDX\\nk=1\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed\\n2DX\\nj=1\\n \\n∂h(s)\\n2L,k\\n∂z1,j\\n!2\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8 (4)\\nConsequently, the stability metric emphasizes the consistency of the paired gradients that both have a greater L2-norm across the\\noutput dimensions.\\nIt is important to note that the mapping from the first to the last RNN state was conditioned on the disturbant tokens occurring at 2\\n˘2264 t ˘2264 L. Nevertheless, the reverse-ordering task trained the networks to retrieve the initial token as their final output regardless\\nof the intervening tokens. Thus, a well-trained RNN would maintain invariance in its final state over the disturbants. Conversely,\\nconsistent gradient directions across varied disturbants would lead to successful learning, which is the premise of the proposed\\nanalysis.\\nUnlike the RNN models, both the standard and position-encoded S4Ds achieved high accuracy over 96% for the initial target token\\n(t = 1), regardless of the frequency of the target and disturbants. Therefore, for the analysis of S4D, the target token was positioned\\nin the middle at t = 23, where the standard model exhibited its poorest accuracy with Rare disturbants. The disturbants were prefixed\\nand suffixed to this target to construct input sequences. The prefix disturbants were shared between the paired sequences, ensuring\\nthat the latent dynamics of the model remained identical up to the target token.\\nIt should also be noted that the latent states of S4D are complex-valued (while its outputs are real-valued), and consequently, the\\ngradients and their dot-product similarities are also complex-valued. For this analysis, the complex-valued gradients were treated as\\ndouble-sized real arrays, and a real-valued similarity was defined by Eq. 3. This is equivalent to taking the real component of the\\ncomplex-valued similarity and is intuitively natural given that a perfect alignment between complex gradient directions yields a\\nreal-valued score of 1.0. Additionally, the extra dimension in the latent states representing the order of the Legendre polynomials\\nwas merged with the channel dimension, and the entire state was treated as a flattened vector.\\nMonitoring the gradients at training checkpoints revealed that Rare disturbants destabilize the learning of standard RNNs. The\\nsimilarity of the paired gradients decreased gradually (GRU) or rapidly (LSTM) when the networks were exposed to Rare disturbants.\\nMost notably, positional encoding endowed the RNNs with robustness to these Rare disturbants. Both the GRU and LSTM\\nmaintained high similarity of the paired gradients across different target/disturbant conditions. In contrast, the impact of positional\\nencoding on the gradient stability of S4D was marginal; unlike the RNNs, the standard S4D was highly stable by itself against Rare\\ndisturbants throughout training, although there was a visible relative destabilization due to Rare disturbants compared to Frequent\\ndisturbants in the early stages of training, as well as an observable improvement by positional encoding. It is also noteworthy that\\nthe difference between Frequent and Rare disturbants diminished after 10,000 training iterations. Consequently, gradient stability\\ndoes not fully account for the decline in S4D accuracy in the presence of Rare disturbants, nor does it explain the enhancement\\nbrought about by positional encoding.\\n45 Discussion\\n5.1 Difficulties in Handling a Large Vocabulary\\nThis study introduced a novel challenge in training standard RNNs: large vocabularies. While investigating the manageable\\nvocabulary size of RNNs appears to be a relevant research area, crucial for practical applications like natural language processing,\\nprevious studies have primarily focused on evaluating and improving the memory duration of RNNs, typically setting the vocabulary\\nsize to a small value (= 8).\\nThis research examined RNN gradients and identified their destabilization when processing low-frequency tokens, which are\\nnecessarily included in a large vocabulary. Specifically, inputs that do not contribute to gradient-based optimization at a target time\\nstep (e.g., tokens at 2 ˘2264 t ˘2264 L upon the retrieval of the initial token at t = 2L in the reverse-ordering task) were found to be\\ndetrimental.\\nIn general time series processing, data points carrying crucial information for specific time steps become irrelevant otherwise.\\nConsequently, each token exhibits a dual nature—both crucial and noisy—throughout the task. Processing rare tokens is particularly\\nchallenging, presumably because they are irrelevant most of the time while making a large impact on learning through the greater\\nloss to compensate for their fewer learning opportunities. Dealing with such \"unignorable noise\" presents a pervasive challenge for\\nRNNs.\\n5.2 Functionality of Positional Encoding beyond the Timekeeper for Transformers\\nAlthough low-frequency tokens destabilize the gradient-based learning of RNNs, this study also discovered that this issue can be\\nalleviated by positional encoding. This enhancement of RNNs via positional encoding is noteworthy because RNNs were specifically\\ndesigned to process time series data on their own; hence, unlike Transformers, they are presumed to function without relying on an\\n\"external clock\". Consequently, position-encoded RNNs have remained largely unexplored, with only two exceptions to the best of\\nthe author’s knowledge. The findings of this study—namely, the improvement in the manageable vocabulary size due to enhanced\\ngradient stability—broaden the currently limited understanding of the impact of positional encoding on RNNs.\\nAdditionally, the results of this study shed new light on the utility of positional encoding. While positional encoding has been viewed\\nas nothing more than input timestamps for Transformers, this study demonstrated its effectiveness in stabilizing the gradients of\\nRNNs against disruption by low-frequency tokens. This novel functionality of positional encoding would not have been visible in\\nTransformer studies, as the model can dynamically adjust the relevance of input tokens through their attention mechanism and thus\\ninherently mitigate the impact of disturbant tokens.\\n5.3 Limitations and Future Directions\\nA primary unresolved question in this study pertains to the mechanism behind the gradient stabilization by positional encoding. All\\nfindings here are based on experimental investigations, lacking rigorous mathematical explanations for how and why the gradients of\\nRNNs are destabilized by infrequent tokens and stabilized by positional encoding. Moreover, this study primarily focused on the\\ncanonical implementation of sinusoidal positional encoding designed for Transformers (Eqs. 1, 2), leaving it open which parameters\\nof the sinusoidal waves (i.e., frequencies and phases) are critical for gradient stabilization. Future research may broaden its scope to\\nencompass more general forms of positional encoding, such as wavelets and non-periodic signals.\\nMoreover, the analysis of gradient stability did not fully address the enhanced performance of the position-encoded state-space\\nmodel (S4D). In terms of accuracy, the positioned-encoded S4D exhibited greater robustness to infrequent tokens compared to the\\nstandard model, resembling the behavior observed in RNNs. However, the gradients of the standard S4D were too stable to account\\nfor this decline in performance. This leaves open the question of how positional encoding influences gradient-based learning of\\nstate-space models. Additionally, future studies may investigate a broader range of state-space models—including the state-of-the-art\\narchitecture of Mamba—to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between positional encoding and these models.\\nIn addition to these scientifically oriented questions, future studies could also address practical applications of position-encoded\\nRNNs and neural state-space models. Although positional encoding enhanced model performance across different synthetic tasks,\\nthe extent of this enhancement is task-dependent. Indeed, while a previous study reported the effectiveness of positional encoding\\nfor an LSTM text summarizer, the present study found no empirical advantage for the language modeling task, aside from a slightly\\nmore rapid decline in training loss. Thus, positional encoding is not a panacea for arbitrary tasks, and further investigations are\\nnecessary to determine when it is effective.\\n6 Appendix\\n6.1 A Other Tasks\\nThis section demonstrates the effectiveness of positional encoding on RNNs across different tasks, besides the reverse ordering task\\ndiscussed in the main text.\\n56.1.1 A.1 Reverse-Ordering + Delayed-Addition\\nThis section reports the performance of position-encoded RNNs on a more complicated, combinatorial task than the reverse ordering\\nof input sequences. Extending the reverse-ordering task, the models received additional random input integers during the output\\nphase, and added each of them to the corresponding token in the reverse-ordered input sequence (modulo the vocabulary size, so that\\nthe output range was bounded).\\nThis task was too challenging to GRUs—even after reducing the input length to L = 16—so only the results from LSTMs are reported\\nbelow. Also, the network was trained for 600,000 iterations (i.e., twice longer than the other tasks) for ensuring the convergence.\\nThe other conditions/hyperparameters were the same as reported in the main text.\\nConsequently, positional encoding improved the model performance as the vocabulary size grew from 896 to 1088.\\n6.1.2 A.2 Sorting\\nIn the reverse ordering task, the order of input integers was important information for accomplishing the task. Thus, positional\\nencoding may play its originally intended role in encoding the temporal information.\\nThis section reports the effectiveness of positional encoding for a task in which the order of input observations was completely\\nirrelevant; the learning objective was to simply sort the input integers in their inherent ascending order (e.g. 8, 29, 2, 11 ˘2192 2, 8,\\n11, 29). The input integers were uniformly randomly sampled with replacement, allowing for ties in the sorting process.\\nAs a result, positional encoding also proved effective for RNNs to handle a larger vocabulary in the sorting task, though the\\nimprovement remained marginal compared to the reverse-ordering task.\\n6.1.3 A.3 Predecessor Query\\nFinally, this section presents benchmark results for the predecessor-query task. The network first received a sequence of non-repeating\\nrandom integers, x1, . . . , xL. Subsequently, one of the non-initial input integers, xtquery (2 ˘2264 tquery ˘2264 L), was randomly\\nselected and reintroduced to the network at time t = L + 1. The learning objective is to return the predecessor of the reviewed integer\\n(= xtquery˘22121). The predecessor-query task evaluates the capacity of RNNs to integrate information regarding both the order and\\ncontent of input sequences.\\nAs in the reverse-ordering + delayed-addition task, the input sequence was reduced to L = 16 due to the complexity of the task, and\\nthe experiment focused on the LSTM. The number of training iterations was maintained at 300,000. Similar to the other benchmarks,\\npositional encoding improved the LSTM’s capacity to manage the larger vocabularies.\\n6.2 B Robustness to Variations in Input Length\\nSo far, all the tasks were experimented using fixed-length inputs (L = 64). One might wonder if positional encoding is exceptionally\\neffective under this setting, informing RNNs with the exact timing when each input token should be returned as the output. Thus, it\\nremains unclear whether or not position-encoded RNNs can also handle a larger vocabulary even when the input length is variable\\nand, thus, the exact timing of the output emission is not identifiable from the positional encoding attached to the inputs.\\nTo assess the robustness to variations in the input length, an additional experiment was conducted on the LSTM, with the input\\nlength varied between 32 and 64. In this setup, the maximum input length (= 64) covers the entirety of the shortest input sequence\\nplus its reversed reconstruction (= 32 + 32). Consequently, the positional encoding per se cannot even distinguish the input vs.\\noutput phases at t = 33, . . . , 64. The vocabulary size was set to 16,384.\\nAs a result, the positional encoding still improved the LSTM’s performance on the reverse-ordering task against the perturbations in\\nthe input length. This result suggests that the effectiveness of the positional encoding for RNNs is not limited to strictly scheduled\\ntasks.\\n6.3 C Effects of Additional Parameters in Position-Encoded RNNs\\nThe concatenation of positional encoding with input embeddings inflates the number of learnable parameters in the input-to-hidden\\nprojection weights. This additional parameterization per se does not influence the learning of the input embeddings, and therefore\\ndoes not elucidate the enhanced performance of position-encoded RNNs. This section substantiates this argument by equalizing the\\nnumber of learnable parameters between the standard and position-encoded models.\\nSpecifically, the equalization was achieved by concatenating two identical copies of the input embeddings and feeding them to the\\nLSTM. This configuration—henceforth termed \"double standard\"—effectively doubled the size of the input- to-hidden weight for\\neach gate in the LSTM, aligning it with that of the position-encoded LSTM, while maintaining all other parameters, including the\\ndimensionality of the (non-repeated) input embeddings.\\nThe double standard LSTM did not yield any improvements in the reverse-ordering or sort- ing tasks. These results affirm that the\\nreported enhancement of RNNs is not merely attributable to the additional parameterization associated with the positional encoding.\\n66.4 D Alternative Implementations of Positional Encoding\\nWhile this study implemented positional encoding by sinusoidal waves, there are alternative implementations proposed in the\\nprevious studies. For instance, the BERT-based models typically encode each token position by a learnable embedding. Moreover, it\\nhas been pointed out that even random vectors can function as positional encoding.\\nAccordingly, these two alternative forms of positional encoding were tested on the LSTM performing the reverse- ordering task.\\nThe random position-encoding vectors were uniformly and independently sampled from the (512 - 1)- dimensional hypersphere.\\nThe learnable embeddings were implemented using the canonical embedding module of PyTorch (torch.nn.Embedding). The input\\nlength and vocabulary size were set to 64 and 16,384 respectively. Both the random vectors and learnable embeddings improved the\\nperformance of LSTM.\\nAmong the different implementations of positional encoding, the sinusoidal encoding outperformed the two alterna- tives. The\\nadvantage of the sinusoidal encoding became more apparent when the input length was variable between 32 and 64; the sinusoidal\\nencoding was more robust to the variations in the input length than the others.\\n6.5 E Language Modeling\\nThis section reports benchmark results for the language modeling task. Single-layer LSTMs with and without sinusoidal positional\\nencoding were trained and tested on the WikiText-103 dataset. Due to constraints in computational resources, the vocabulary was\\nreduced from the original size of 267,735 to 32,768 by retokenizing the raw data using SentencePiece. The headings were removed,\\nand the main text was segmented by paragraphs (separated by the line break). Additionally, only the first 1024 tokens of each\\nparagraph were utilized for training and testing, ensuring that the absolute positional encoding always aligned with the beginning of\\neach paragraph. The hyperparameters were configured as specified in Section 3.3.\\nPositional encoding proved effective only for marginally faster learning during the initial phase of training. The difference diminished\\naround 10,000/30,000 iterations, and the test perplexities of the position-encoded model were inferior to those of the standard model.\\nTable 1: Test perplexities on the WikiText-103 dataset.

Ultimately, this study pushes the boundaries of interdisciplinary inquiry,\\nproviding a rigorous, nuanced framework for addressing the moral complexities of\\ninterstellar cooperation while challenging our assumptions about humanity’s place\\nin the universe.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe pursuit of understanding the intricacies of extra-terrestrial life and its potential implications\\non human society has long been a topic of fascination and debate. As we continue to advance in\\nour search for life beyond Earth, it is becoming increasingly evident that the discovery of alien\\ncivilizations could have profound effects on our collective worldview, challenging our existing\\nbeliefs and moral frameworks. In light of this, it is essential to consider the role of Bayesian\\ntheology in facilitating a deeper understanding of the potential for shared moral frameworks with\\nalien civilizations. By employing Bayesian inference, we can systematically analyze the likelihood\\nof encountering extraterrestrial life that adheres to a similar moral compass as humanity, thereby\\nenabling more effective and meaningful diplomatic interactions.\\nThe concept of a shared moral framework is inherently complex, as it relies on a multitude of factors,\\nincluding the aliens’ cognitive abilities, cultural background, and environmental influences. Moreover,\\nthe possibility of encountering a civilization with a completely disparate moral framework raises\\nquestions about the universality of ethical principles and the potential for intergalactic cooperation.\\nIt is within this context that Bayesian theology emerges as a vital tool, allowing us to quantify the\\nuncertainty associated with these encounters and subsequently inform our diplomatic strategies.\\nOne approach to tackling this problem involves the development of a moral framework taxonomy,\\nwhich would categorize various ethical systems based on their underlying principles and values. Thistaxonomy could then be used to construct a Bayesian network, enabling the inference of probability\\ndistributions over the possible moral frameworks that an alien civilization might adhere to. However,\\nthis approach is not without its challenges, as it relies on a deeper understanding of the moral and\\nphilosophical underpinnings of human civilization, as well as the potential for alternative moral\\nframeworks that may be incomprehensible to humanity.\\nAn alternative, albeit unconventional, approach to this problem involves the application of Jungian\\nanalytical psychology, which posits the existence of a collective unconscious that transcends human\\nculture and experience. According to this perspective, certain archetypes and moral principles may\\nbe universally shared across the cosmos, providing a common foundation for intergalactic diplomacy.\\nThis idea is supported by the premise that many human myths and legends contain themes and motifs\\nthat are eerily similar, despite being developed in isolation from one another. It is possible that\\nthese shared archetypes may serve as a cosmic moral lingua franca, facilitating communication and\\ncooperation between human and alien civilizations.\\nFurthermore, recent advances in the field of astrobiology have led to a greater understanding of the\\nconditions necessary for life to emerge and thrive on other planets. The discovery of exoplanets with\\nenvironments similar to those of Earth has sparked hope that we may soon encounter life beyond\\nour solar system. However, this also raises questions about the potential for moral frameworks to\\nevolve in response to different environmental pressures. For instance, a civilization that develops on\\na planet with scarce resources may be more likely to adopt a utilitarian moral framework, whereas a\\ncivilization that evolves in a resource-rich environment may be more inclined towards a deontological\\napproach.\\nIn addition to these considerations, it is also essential to examine the potential implications of\\nencountering an alien civilization with a moral framework that is fundamentally at odds with our\\nown. This could lead to a range of complex diplomatic and ethical dilemmas, as humanity would be\\nforced to confront the possibility that its own moral assumptions may not be universal. Moreover,\\nthe encounter could also raise questions about the nature of morality itself, challenging our existing\\nunderstanding of right and wrong and potentially leading to a reevaluation of human values and\\nprinciples.\\nThe integration of Bayesian theology and astrobiology also raises interesting questions about the\\npotential for a \"moral cosmology,\" which would seek to understand the underlying moral principles\\nthat govern the universe. This could involve the development of a new field of study, one that\\ncombines insights from theology, philosophy, and astrobiology to provide a deeper understanding of\\nthe cosmos and our place within it. By exploring the moral implications of astrobiological discoveries,\\nwe may uncover new avenues for inquiry and new perspectives on the human condition, ultimately\\nleading to a more nuanced and informed approach to intergalactic diplomacy.\\nMoreover, the prospect of encountering alien civilizations with disparate moral frameworks also\\nprompts us to reexamine our own moral assumptions and the values that underlie human society.\\nThis could involve a critical evaluation of our existing moral principles, as well as an exploration\\nof alternative ethical systems that may be more conducive to intergalactic cooperation. Ultimately,\\nthe development of a Bayesian theological framework for extra-terrestrial diplomacy will require a\\nmultidisciplinary approach, one that draws on insights from theology, philosophy, astrobiology, and\\neconomics to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex moral and ethical issues at play.\\nThe application of Bayesian inference to the problem of inferring shared moral frameworks with alien\\ncivilizations also raises intriguing questions about the nature of probability and uncertainty in the\\ncontext of intergalactic diplomacy. By quantifying the uncertainty associated with these encounters,\\nwe may uncover new insights into the potential for cooperation and conflict, as well as the moral and\\nethical implications of our actions. This could involve the development of new probabilistic models\\nand algorithms, ones that are specifically designed to address the unique challenges and uncertainties\\nof intergalactic diplomacy.\\nIn conclusion, the exploration of Bayesian theology and its application to extra-terrestrial diplomacy\\nrepresents a fascinating and complex area of inquiry, one that challenges our existing understanding\\nof morality, ethics, and the cosmos. As we continue to advance in our search for life beyond Earth, it\\nis essential that we develop a deeper understanding of the potential for shared moral frameworks with\\nalien civilizations, and that we establish a framework for intergalactic diplomacy that is informed\\nby a nuanced and multifaceted approach to morality and ethics. By doing so, we may uncover new\\n2avenues for cooperation and mutual understanding, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and\\npeaceful universe.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe concept of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy is a multifaceted and interdisciplinary\\nfield that has garnered significant attention in recent years. At its core, this field seeks to develop a\\nprobabilistic framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human\\nand alien civilizations. This endeavor is inherently complex, as it requires an integration of insights\\nfrom theology, astrobiology, philosophy, and diplomacy, among other disciplines.\\nOne of the foundational challenges in this field is the development of a rigorous methodology for\\ninferring the probability of shared moral frameworks. This requires a deep understanding of the\\nphilosophical and theological underpinnings of human morality, as well as a willingness to consider\\nthe possibility of alternative moral frameworks that may be employed by alien civilizations. Some\\nresearchers have proposed the use of Bayesian inference techniques, which provide a probabilistic\\nframework for updating beliefs based on new evidence. However, the application of these techniques\\nto the field of extra-terrestrial diplomacy is still in its infancy, and significant work remains to be\\ndone in order to develop a robust and reliable methodology.\\nIn addition to the methodological challenges, there are also significant theoretical and conceptual\\nhurdles that must be overcome. For example, the concept of morality is often closely tied to the\\nspecific cultural and historical context of a given civilization. As such, it is possible that alien\\ncivilizations may possess moral frameworks that are fundamentally incompatible with our own.\\nThis raises important questions about the potential for moral relativism, and the extent to which\\nhuman morality can be considered universal. Some researchers have argued that the discovery of\\nextraterrestrial life could challenge our current understanding of morality, and potentially lead to a\\nre-evaluation of our values and principles.\\nDespite these challenges, there have been several notable attempts to develop a framework for\\nunderstanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations. One\\napproach that has garnered significant attention is the use of game theoretical models, which provide\\na mathematical framework for analyzing the strategic interactions between different agents. These\\nmodels have been used to study a wide range of scenarios, from the evolution of cooperation to the\\nemergence of conflict. However, their application to the field of extra-terrestrial diplomacy is still\\nhighly speculative, and significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous and reliable\\nframework for predicting the behavior of alien civilizations.\\nAnother approach that has been proposed is the use of anthropological and sociological insights\\nto understand the potential for shared moral frameworks. This approach recognizes that human\\nmorality is shaped by a complex array of cultural, historical, and environmental factors, and seeks to\\nidentify potential parallels and analogies with alien civilizations. For example, some researchers have\\nargued that the emergence of complex social structures and cooperative behaviors in certain animal\\nspecies may provide insights into the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and\\nalien civilizations. However, this approach is still highly speculative, and significant work remains to\\nbe done in order to develop a rigorous and reliable framework for understanding the potential for\\nshared moral frameworks.\\nIn a bizarre and unexpected twist, some researchers have also proposed the use of psychedelic\\nsubstances as a means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien\\ncivilizations. The idea behind this approach is that psychedelic substances can alter human perception\\nand consciousness in ways that may facilitate a deeper understanding of alternative moral frameworks\\nand modes of cognition. While this approach is certainly unorthodox, it has garnered significant\\nattention and interest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means\\nof facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations.\\nFurthermore, the concept of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy also raises important\\nquestions about the potential for moral and ethical implications of encountering alien civilizations.\\nFor example, if we were to encounter an alien civilization that possesses a fundamentally incompatible\\nmoral framework, would we be morally obligated to attempt to communicate and understand their\\n3perspective, or would we be justified in prioritizing our own moral and ethical principles? These are\\ncomplex and difficult questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis.\\nIn addition, the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also\\nraises important questions about the concept of universal morality. If we were to discover that certain\\nmoral principles are universal and shared across multiple civilizations, would this provide evidence\\nfor the existence of a universal moral law, or would it simply reflect the fact that certain moral\\nprinciples are highly adaptable and useful in a wide range of contexts? These are important questions,\\nand ones that require careful consideration and analysis.\\nMoreover, the field of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy also intersects with the field\\nof astrobiology, which seeks to understand the potential for life to exist elsewhere in the universe. The\\ndiscovery of exoplanets and the detection of biosignatures in the atmospheres of certain planets have\\nprovided significant evidence for the potential for life to exist elsewhere in the universe. However, the\\nexistence of life does not necessarily imply the existence of intelligent life, or the potential for shared\\nmoral frameworks. As such, significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous and\\nreliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human and\\nalien civilizations.\\nThe potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also raises important\\nquestions about the concept of morality and its relationship to the universe. For example, if we were\\nto discover that certain moral principles are universal and shared across multiple civilizations, would\\nthis provide evidence for the existence of a moral law that is inherent in the universe itself, or would\\nit simply reflect the fact that certain moral principles are highly adaptable and useful in a wide range\\nof contexts? These are important questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis.\\nAdditionally, the field of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy also intersects with the field\\nof philosophy, which seeks to understand the nature of reality and our place within it. The potential for\\nshared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations raises important questions about the\\nnature of morality and its relationship to the universe. For example, if we were to discover that certain\\nmoral principles are universal and shared across multiple civilizations, would this provide evidence\\nfor the existence of a moral law that is inherent in the universe itself, or would it simply reflect the\\nfact that certain moral principles are highly adaptable and useful in a wide range of contexts? These\\nare important questions, and ones that require careful consideration and analysis.\\nIn another unexpected turn, some researchers have also proposed the use of fringe sciences, such as\\nufology and cryptozoology, as a means of understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks\\nbetween human and alien civilizations. The idea behind this approach is that these fields may provide\\ninsights into the potential for alternative forms of life and consciousness that may exist elsewhere in\\nthe universe. While this approach is certainly unorthodox, it has garnered significant attention and\\ninterest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means of facilitating\\ncommunication and understanding between human and alien civilizations.\\nThe potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also raises important\\nquestions about the concept of cultural relativism. If we were to encounter an alien civilization\\nthat possesses a fundamentally incompatible moral framework, would we be morally obligated to\\nattempt to understand and respect their perspective, or would we be justified in prioritizing our own\\nmoral and ethical principles? These are complex and difficult questions, and ones that require careful\\nconsideration and analysis.\\nIn a surprising development, some researchers have also proposed the use of artificial intelligence\\nas a means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations.\\nThe idea behind this approach is that artificial intelligence may provide a means of transcending the\\nlimitations of human language and cognition, and facilitating a deeper understanding of alternative\\nmoral frameworks and modes of cognition. While this approach is still highly speculative, it has\\ngarnered significant attention and interest in certain quarters, and may potentially provide a novel\\nand innovative means of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien\\ncivilizations.\\nThe potential for shared moral frameworks between human and alien civilizations also intersects with\\nthe field of diplomacy, which seeks to understand the potential for cooperation and conflict between\\ndifferent nations and civilizations. The discovery of extraterrestrial life could potentially lead to a\\nfundamentally new era of diplomacy, as human civilizations seek to navigate the complexities of\\n4interspecies communication and cooperation. However, this would also raise important questions\\nabout the potential for moral and ethical implications of encountering alien civilizations, and the need\\nfor a rigorous and reliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks.\\nIn a bizarre and unexpected tangent, some researchers have also proposed the use ofCrop circles as a\\nmeans of facilitating communication and understanding between human and alien civilizations. The\\nidea behind this approach is that crop circles may provide a means of non-verbal communication, and\\nfacilitate a deeper understanding of alternative moral frameworks and modes of cognition. While\\nthis approach is certainly unorthodox, it has garnered significant attention and interest in certain\\nquarters, and may potentially provide a novel and innovative means of facilitating communication\\nand understanding between human and alien civilizations.\\nThe concept of Bayesian theology for extra-terrestrial diplomacy is a complex and multifaceted\\nfield that requires an integration of insights from theology, astrobiology, philosophy, and diplomacy,\\namong other disciplines. While significant work remains to be done in order to develop a rigorous\\nand reliable framework for understanding the potential for shared moral frameworks between human\\nand alien civilizations, the potential rewards are significant. The discovery of extraterrestrial life\\ncould potentially lead to a fundamentally new era of cooperation and understanding between human\\nand alien civilizations, and could provide important insights into the nature of morality and its\\nrelationship to the universe. As such, continued research and exploration in this field is essential, and\\nmay potentially lead to a deeper understanding of the complexities and mysteries of the universe.\\nFurthermore, it is also essential to consider the potential implications of encountering alien civiliza-\\ntions that possess advanced technologies and capabilities. For example, if an alien civilization were to\\npossess technology that is significantly more advanced than our own, would we be morally obligated\\nto attempt to learn from them and adapt their technologies, or would we be justified in prioritizing\\nour own technological development and autonomy? These are complex and difficult questions, and\\nones that require careful consideration and analysis.\\n3 Methodology\\nTo develop a comprehensive framework for Bayesian Theology in the context of Extra-Terrestrial\\nDiplomacy, we first established a foundational understanding of the theological and philosophical\\nunderpinnings of moral frameworks across potential alien civilizations. This involved an exhaustive\\nreview of terrestrial religious and ethical systems, seeking commonalities and divergences that\\ncould inform our hypotheses about extraterrestrial moralities. We hypothesized that any civilization\\nadvanced enough to communicate with us would have grappled with similar fundamental questions\\nregarding the nature of existence, the balance between individual and collective well-being, and the\\nrole of altruism versus self-preservation.\\nA critical component of our methodology was the development of a novel Bayesian inference engine,\\nwhich we term \"Xenothetic Inference Module\" (XIM). The XIM is designed to integrate disparate data\\nstreams, including but not limited to: astrobiological findings, the spectral analysis of exoplanetary\\natmospheres, patterns in celestial mechanics that could indicate the presence of megastructures,\\nand even the detection of mathematical or linguistic patterns in purported alien transmissions. By\\ncontinuously updating its probabilistic models based on new evidence, the XIM aims to estimate the\\nlikelihood of encountering civilizations with moral frameworks that overlap with our own, facilitating\\nmore effective and ethical communication strategies.\\nIn an unexpected turn, our research also explored the potential application of quantum entanglement as\\na means of interstellar communication that could bypass traditional limitations imposed by the speed\\nof light. Theoretically, entangled particles could serve as a conduit for instantaneous information\\nexchange, regardless of spatial separation. This led us down a fascinating, albeit highly speculative,\\npath considering the implications of quantum non-locality on the nature of interstellar morality and\\ncooperation. We posited that civilizations capable of harnessing entanglement for communication\\nmight develop unique ethical perspectives, given the fundamentally non-local character of their\\ninterconnectedness.\\nFurthermore, our team conducted an extensive survey of science fiction literature and cinema,\\nanalyzing depictions of alien civilizations and their moral structures. This may seem unconventional,\\nbut we reasoned that speculative fiction often serves as a reflection of human hopes, fears, and\\n5philosophical introspections about our place in the universe. By examining the diversity of imagined\\nextraterrestrial societies and their ethical dilemmas, we aimed to catalog a wide range of possible\\nmoral frameworks that could exist elsewhere in the universe. This approach, termed \"narrative\\nanthropology,\" allowed us to consider scenarios that might not be immediately apparent through\\nmore traditional scientific or theological inquiry.\\nMoreover, we invested significant effort into developing a taxonomy of potential alien value sys-\\ntems, categorizing them based on their putative ethical, utilitarian, deontological, or virtue-based\\norientations. This classification scheme, while not exhaustive, provided a structured framework for\\npredicting how different types of civilizations might interact with humanity, based on their inferred\\nmoral principles. An intriguing outcome of this work was the realization that certain forms of alien\\nlife, particularly those with collective or hive-minded consciousness, might adopt moral frameworks\\nthat are incommensurable with human ethical discourse, challenging our assumptions about the\\nuniversality of moral values.\\nIn a bold, albeit somewhat unorthodox, move, our research team also collaborated with a group of\\nexperimental artists to create an \"interstellar moral probe\" – a transcendent, symbolic representation\\nof human ethics and values embedded within a cosmic ray-based transmission. The rationale behind\\nthis artistic endeavor was to explore the boundaries of moral expression and recognition across vastly\\ndifferent cultural and biological contexts. By broadcasting an essence of human morality into the\\ncosmos, we hoped to stimulate a form of \"moral resonance\" that could, in theory, be detected or\\nresponded to by civilizations attuned to similar ethical frequencies.\\nThrough these multifaceted approaches, our study endeavored to bridge the gap between the scientific\\npursuit of extraterrestrial life and the philosophical exploration of moral universalism. By synthesizing\\ninsights from theology, ethics, astrobiology, and quantum mechanics, we sought to illuminate the\\nintricate, uncharted landscape of interstellar morality, navigating toward a deeper understanding of\\nthe shared moral frameworks that might unite intelligent life across the cosmos. Ultimately, our\\nmethodology, though eclectic and provocative, underscores the profound complexity and richness of\\nexploring the moral dimensions of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn an effort to operationalize the conceptual framework of Bayesian Theology for Extra-Terrestrial\\nDiplomacy, a series of experiments were conducted to infer the probability of shared moral frame-\\nworks with alien civilizations. The methodology employed a multi-faceted approach, incorporating\\nelements of astrobiology, cognitive psychology, and philosophical theology. Initially, a comprehen-\\nsive review of existing literature on the Fermi Paradox, the Drake Equation, and the Zoo Hypothesis\\nwas undertaken to contextualize the research within the broader discourse of extraterrestrial life\\nand its potential implications for human society. This was supplemented by an exhaustive analy-\\nsis of mythological and theological narratives from diverse cultural traditions, seeking to identify\\ncommonalities and divergences in the moral and ethical frameworks underpinning these stories.\\nTo further ground the research in empirical data, a mixed-methods survey was administered to a\\nsample of 10,000 individuals, representing a cross-section of the global population in terms of\\ndemographic variables such as age, gender, geographical location, and socio-economic status. The\\nsurvey instrument consisted of a combination of Likert scale questions, open-ended prompts, and a\\nnovel \"Moral Dilemma Resolution\" task, which presented participants with a series of hypothetical\\nscenarios involving conflicts between individual rights and collective well-being, and asked them to\\nprovide narrative responses detailing their decision-making processes. The data generated from this\\nsurvey were then subjected to a Bayesian analysis, utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\\nsimulations to estimate the posterior distributions of parameters representing the probability of shared\\nmoral values among humans and, by extension, potentially among alien civilizations.\\nAn unexpected tangent emerged during the data collection phase, as a subgroup of participants began\\nto report experiences of \"moral downloading,\" whereby they claimed to have received intuitive insights\\ninto the moral frameworks of hypothetical alien civilizations. These reports were characterized by\\na sense of immediacy and certainty, with participants often describing the experience as akin to\\naccessing a collective unconscious or tapping into a cosmic reservoir of moral knowledge. While\\nthese claims were not anticipated at the outset of the study, they were nonetheless incorporated into\\n6the analysis, with a separate MCMC model developed to estimate the probability of such \"moral\\ndownloading\" events occurring within the context of human-alien interactions.\\nA bizarre approach was also adopted in the form of a \"simulated alien encounter\" protocol, wherein\\nparticipants were immersed in a virtual reality environment designed to mimic the conditions of\\na hypothetical first contact scenario. Within this virtual environment, participants were presented\\nwith a series of moral dilemmas tailored to the specific context of interstellar relations, such as the\\nmanagement of resources, the resolution of conflicts, and the balancing of individual freedoms with\\ncollective security. The responses generated by participants during these simulated encounters were\\nthen analyzed using a combination of natural language processing and thematic analysis, aiming to\\nidentify patterns and themes that could inform the development of a shared moral framework for\\nhuman-alien diplomacy.\\nIn an effort to further validate the findings, a table was constructed to summarize the results of the\\nsurvey and the simulated alien encounter protocol, as shown below: The estimates presented in this\\nTable 1: Probability Estimates of Shared Moral Values among Humans and Alien Civilizations\\nMoral Value Human-Human Human-Alien (Simulated) Human-Alien (Moral Downloading)\\nRespect for Life 0.85 0.62 0.81\\nCooperation 0.78 0.58 0.75\\nFairness 0.82 0.65 0.80\\nIndividual Rights 0.75 0.55 0.70\\nCollective Well-being 0.80 0.60 0.78\\ntable suggest that, while there may be some degree of overlap in the moral values held by humans\\nand hypothetical alien civilizations, there are also significant discrepancies and uncertainties that\\nmust be accounted for in the development of a shared moral framework for interstellar diplomacy.\\nFurthermore, the inclusion of \"moral downloading\" events in the analysis appears to have introduced\\na degree of instability into the estimates, highlighting the need for further research into the nature and\\nimplications of such phenomena.\\nThe experiments also involved an examination of the role of ritual and symbolism in facilitating\\nhuman-alien communication and cooperation. A series of \"inter Species Rituals\" were designed and\\nimplemented, incorporating elements of music, dance, and visual art to convey moral and ethical\\nprinciples in a universally intelligible language. The results of these experiments were mixed, with\\nsome participants reporting a sense of profound connection and understanding with the hypothetical\\nalien entities, while others experienced confusion, disorientation, or even a sense of moral outrage.\\nThese findings underscore the complexity and unpredictability of interstellar relations, and highlight\\nthe need for a nuanced and multi-faceted approach to the development of a shared moral framework\\nfor human-alien diplomacy.\\nIn addition to these experimental protocols, a range of secondary analyses were conducted to explore\\nthe implications of the research for our understanding of the human condition and the potential\\nfor moral growth and evolution in the context of interstellar relations. These analyses involved\\nthe application of theoretical frameworks from fields such as cognitive science, anthropology, and\\nphilosophy, and aimed to shed light on the deeper structural and existential implications of the research\\nfindings. The results of these analyses are presented in the following sections, and are intended to\\ncontribute to a broader conversation about the nature and significance of Bayesian Theology for\\nExtra-Terrestrial Diplomacy.\\n5 Results\\nThe investigation into the probability of shared moral frameworks with alien civilizations has yielded\\na plethora of intriguing results, warranting a nuanced and multifaceted examination. Initially, our\\nresearch endeavors focused on establishing a foundational framework for Bayesian inference in the\\ncontext of interstellar diplomacy. This involved the development of a novel probabilistic model,\\nherein referred to as the \"Interstellar Moral Alignment\" (IMA) model, which seeks to quantify the\\nlikelihood of convergent moral values between human and extraterrestrial civilizations.\\n7The IMA model is predicated on the assumption that the emergence of complex life and, subsequently,\\nmoral frameworks, is influenced by a combination of universal principles and contingent factors.\\nBy integrating insights from astrophysics, astrobiology, and the philosophy of morality, we have\\nendeavored to create a comprehensive and adaptable framework for predicting the probability of\\nshared moral values. Notably, our model incorporates an innovative \"Moral Similarity Index\" (MSI),\\nwhich serves as a quantitative metric for evaluating the degree of congruence between disparate moral\\nsystems.\\nTo facilitate a more robust understanding of the IMA model’s predictive capabilities, we conducted\\nan extensive series of simulations, incorporating a diverse range of parameters and initial conditions.\\nThese simulations revealed a fascinating pattern of results, wherein the predicted probability of shared\\nmoral frameworks exhibited a non-linear relationship with the distance between civilizations. Specifi-\\ncally, our findings suggest that the likelihood of convergent moral values increases exponentially as\\nthe distance between civilizations decreases, up to a critical threshold of approximately 10 parsecs.\\nBeyond this threshold, the predicted probability undergoes a precipitous decline, implying that the\\nemergence of shared moral frameworks is highly sensitive to the proximity of civilizations.\\nFurthermore, our research has also explored the intriguing possibility of \"moral harmonic resonance,\"\\nwherein the collective moral values of multiple civilizations become synchronized, giving rise to a\\nharmonious and cohesive interstellar moral framework. This phenomenon is hypothesized to occur\\nwhen the MSI values of participating civilizations exceed a critical threshold, thereby facilitating\\nthe emergence of a unified and shared moral perspective. While the existence of moral harmonic\\nresonance remains purely speculative at this juncture, our simulations suggest that it could potentially\\nplay a pivotal role in shaping the moral landscape of the galaxy, particularly in regions with high\\ndensities of intelligent life.\\nIn addition to these findings, our investigation has also uncovered a range of unexpected and seemingly\\nanomalous results, which challenge our current understanding of Bayesian inference in the context\\nof interstellar diplomacy. For instance, our simulations have revealed that the incorporation of\\n\"quantum fluctuations\" into the IMA model can significantly enhance the predicted probability of\\nshared moral frameworks, particularly in scenarios where civilizations are separated by vast distances.\\nThis phenomenon, which we have termed \"quantum moral entanglement,\" appears to be linked to the\\nnon-local correlations between particles and has significant implications for our understanding of the\\ninterplay between morality and the fundamental laws of physics.\\nTo further elucidate the complex relationships between these variables, we have constructed a\\ncomprehensive table summarizing the key results of our simulations, as shown below:\\nTable 2: Simulation Results for Interstellar Moral Alignment\\nSimulation ID Distance (parsecs) MSI Value Predicted Probability Quantum Fluctuations\\nSIM-001 5 0.8 0.75 No\\nSIM-002 10 0.6 0.4 Yes\\nSIM-003 15 0.4 0.2 No\\nSIM-004 20 0.2 0.1 Yes\\nSIM-005 25 0.1 0.05 No\\nSIM-006 30 0.05 0.01 Yes\\nThe data presented in this table highlights the complex interplay between variables such as distance,\\nMSI value, and quantum fluctuations, and underscores the need for further research into the underlying\\nmechanisms governing the emergence of shared moral frameworks. Moreover, the occurrence of\\nquantum moral entanglement in certain simulations serves as a poignant reminder of the profound\\nand unsettling implications of quantum mechanics for our understanding of reality, and the need for a\\nmore nuanced and interdisciplinary approach to the study of interstellar diplomacy.\\nIn conclusion, our research has yielded a rich tapestry of results, replete with unexpected twists\\nand tantalizing prospects for future investigation. The IMA model, with its incorporated MSI and\\nquantum fluctuations, has demonstrated a remarkable capacity for predicting the probability of shared\\nmoral frameworks, while the phenomenon of moral harmonic resonance offers a compelling vision\\nof a harmonious and unified interstellar moral landscape. As we continue to explore the vast expanse\\nof the galaxy, it is our hope that this research will contribute meaningfully to the development of\\n8a more sophisticated and nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between intelligent\\nlife, morality, and the cosmos. Ultimately, the pursuit of knowledge in this domain is driven by\\nan insatiable curiosity regarding the nature of existence and our place within the grand tapestry of\\nthe universe, and it is our sincere belief that the continued exploration of these themes will yield a\\nprofound and lasting impact on the trajectory of human civilization.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, our exploration of Bayesian Theology for Extra-Terrestrial Diplomacy has yielded a\\nplethora of intriguing insights into the potential for shared moral frameworks with alien civilizations.\\nThrough the application of Bayesian inference, we have developed a novel framework for assessing\\nthe probability of convergent moral values amongst extraterrestrial intelligences. This approach has\\nfacilitated a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between moral philosophy, astrobiology,\\nand the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Our research has far-reaching implications for the\\nfield of astrodiplomacy, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates\\nphilosophical, theological, and scientific perspectives.\\nOne of the most significant contributions of our study is the introduction of the concept of \"moral\\nmirror symmetry,\" which posits that the probability of shared moral values between two civilizations\\nis directly proportional to the degree of symmetry between their respective moral frameworks. This\\nconcept has been shown to be remarkably effective in predicting the likelihood of cooperation\\nand conflict between different civilizations, and has important implications for the development of\\nstrategies for interstellar diplomacy. Furthermore, our research has also explored the possibility of\\nusing Bayesian inference to identify \"moral anomalies\" - instances where the observed behavior of\\nan alien civilization deviates significantly from the predicted moral framework. These anomalies may\\nhold the key to unlocking a deeper understanding of the moral and philosophical underpinnings of\\nextraterrestrial cultures.\\nIn a surprising twist, our analysis has also revealed a fascinating connection between the probability\\nof shared moral frameworks and the presence of certain types of celestial bodies in a given star system.\\nSpecifically, we have found that the presence of a gas giant planet in the habitable zone of a star is\\nstrongly correlated with a increased probability of shared moral values amongst the intelligent species\\ninhabiting that system. This phenomenon, which we have dubbed the \"Jupiter Effect,\" has significant\\nimplications for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and suggests that the presence of gas giant\\nplanets may be an important factor in the development of complex life and moral systems.\\nMoreover, our study has also explored the possibility of using artificial intelligence and machine\\nlearning algorithms to simulate the evolution of moral frameworks in alien civilizations. This\\napproach has allowed us to model the dynamics of moral development in a wide range of scenarios,\\nfrom the emergence of simple moral codes in primitive societies to the complex moral philosophies\\nof advanced civilizations. One of the most interesting results of this research is the discovery of\\na \"moral singularity\" - a point at which the moral framework of an alien civilization becomes so\\ncomplex and nuanced that it is effectively incomprehensible to human observers. This phenomenon\\nhas significant implications for our understanding of the limits of moral knowledge and the potential\\nfor mutual understanding between human and alien civilizations.\\nIn addition to these findings, our research has also touched on a number of more speculative and\\nphilosophical topics, including the possibility of a \"multiverse of moralities\" - a vast ensemble of\\nparallel universes, each with its own unique moral framework and set of moral principles. This\\nidea, while still highly speculative, has significant implications for our understanding of the nature\\nof morality and the human condition, and raises important questions about the potential for moral\\ndiversity and convergence across the multiverse. Furthermore, our study has also explored the\\npossibility of using \"moral archeology\" - a technique for reconstructing the moral frameworks of\\nextinct civilizations through the analysis of archaeological and anthropological data. This approach\\nhas allowed us to gain a unique insight into the moral and philosophical values of long-lost cultures,\\nand has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of human morality and the\\ndevelopment of complex societies.\\nFinally, our research has also highlighted the need for a more nuanced and sophisticated understanding\\nof the complex interplay between morality, culture, and technology in the context of astrodiplomacy.\\nAs we continue to explore the possibility of extraterrestrial life and the potential for interstellar\\n9cooperation and conflict, it is essential that we develop a deeper understanding of the moral and\\nphilosophical principles that underlie the actions and decisions of alien civilizations. This will require\\na multidisciplinary approach that incorporates insights from philosophy, theology, anthropology, and\\na range of other disciplines, and will ultimately depend on our ability to develop a more nuanced and\\nempathetic understanding of the diverse range of moral and cultural perspectives that exist across the\\nuniverse. By pursuing this line of research, we may ultimately uncover new and innovative solutions\\nto the complex challenges of astrodiplomacy, and develop a more profound understanding of the\\nintricate web of moral and philosophical relationships that bind us to the stars.\\n10'},\n",

Remarkably, this\\nstability persists even when external factors like sugar or cream are introduced.\\nThese findings hold profound implications for optimizing coffee preparation, de-\\nsigning materials with tailored diffusion properties, and advancing the study of\\ncomplex systems.\\nBeyond practical applications, the research has uncovered potential for coffee-\\nbased cryptography, using caffeine diffusion patterns as secure encryption keys.\\nThis work highlights the broader significance of GNNs and espresso foam in\\nmaterials science, dynamical systems, and interdisciplinary innovation, opening\\nnew frontiers in the study of emergence, self-organization, and complexity across\\ndiverse domains.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe realm of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has witnessed a surge in popularity in recent years,\\nprimarily due to their ability to effectively model complex relationships within intricate networks.\\nThis has led to a plethora of applications across various domains, including social network analysis,\\ntraffic prediction, and molecular dynamics. However, the potential of GNNs extends far beyond these\\nconventional areas, and one such uncharted territory is the prediction of caffeine diffusion patterns in\\nholographically prepared espresso foam. At first glance, this may seem like an esoteric application,\\nbut it is, in fact, a crucial aspect of optimizing the espresso-making process, as the distribution of\\ncaffeine within the foam can significantly impact the overall flavor and aroma of the beverage.\\nFurthermore, the incorporation of holographic preparation techniques introduces an additional\\nlayer of complexity, as the three-dimensional structure of the foam can be precisely controlled and\\nmanipulated. This, in turn, allows for the creation of intricate patterns and designs, which can be\\nused to visualize and analyze the diffusion of caffeine within the foam. The fusion of GNNs and\\nholographic preparation techniques offers a unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of caffeine\\ndiffusion in a highly controlled and precise manner.\\nIt is worth noting that previous research has shown that the diffusion of caffeine within espresso foam\\nis influenced by a multitude of factors, including the type of coffee beans used, the roast level, and thebrewing method. However, these studies have been limited to two-dimensional analysis and have not\\ntaken into account the complex three-dimensional structure of the foam. The application of GNNs to\\nthis problem can potentially overcome these limitations, as they are capable of modeling complex\\nrelationships within high-dimensional data.\\nIn addition to the technical aspects of caffeine diffusion, it is also essential to consider the philosoph-\\nical implications of this research. The use of GNNs to predict the behavior of caffeine molecules\\nwithin a complex network of foam cells raises fundamental questions about the nature of reality and\\nour perception of the world. For instance, can we truly consider the foam as a mere medium for\\nthe diffusion of caffeine, or does it possess a inherent consciousness that influences the behavior\\nof the molecules? While this line of inquiry may seem speculative, it is, in fact, a crucial aspect\\nof understanding the intricate relationships between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the\\nespresso-making process.\\nMoreover, the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam can\\nalso be seen as a manifestation of the underlying structure of the universe. The intricate networks\\nand patterns that emerge within the foam can be viewed as a reflection of the fundamental laws of\\nphysics that govern the behavior of particles and molecules. In this sense, the application of GNNs to\\nthis problem can be seen as an attempt to decipher the underlying code of the universe, where the\\ndiffusion of caffeine molecules serves as a proxy for the underlying dynamics of the cosmos.\\nThe development of a GNN-based framework for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographi-\\ncally prepared espresso foam also has significant implications for the field of materials science. The\\nability to control and manipulate the structure of the foam at a microscopic level can be used to create\\nnovel materials with unique properties, such as tailored thermal conductivity or optical transparency.\\nThe application of GNNs to this problem can provide valuable insights into the relationships between\\nthe structure and properties of these materials, which can be used to optimize their performance in a\\nwide range of applications.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, our preliminary research has also revealed that the diffusion of caffeine\\nwithin the foam is not solely determined by physical processes, but also by a range of paranormal\\nfactors, including the intentions of the barista, the alignment of the stars, and the presence of negative\\nthoughts in the surrounding environment. While these findings may seem anomalous, they are, in\\nfact, a manifestation of the complex interplay between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the\\nespresso-making process. The incorporation of these factors into our GNN-based framework has\\nbeen shown to significantly improve the accuracy of our predictions, and we believe that this line of\\ninquiry holds great promise for the development of novel, holistic approaches to coffee production.\\nThe potential applications of this research extend far beyond the realm of coffee production, and can\\nbe used to inform the development of novel materials, optimize complex systems, and even provide\\ninsights into the fundamental nature of reality. As we continue to push the boundaries of what is\\npossible with GNNs and holographic preparation techniques, we may uncover even more unexpected\\nand bizarre phenomena that challenge our current understanding of the world. Ultimately, the study\\nof caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam serves as a reminder that,\\neven in the most seemingly mundane aspects of our lives, lies a complex web of relationships and\\nphenomena waiting to be uncovered and explored.\\nThe complex interplay between the physical and metaphysical aspects of the espresso-making process\\nalso raises questions about the role of human intention and perception in shaping the behavior of\\ncaffeine molecules within the foam. Can the mere act of observation influence the diffusion of\\ncaffeine, or is this process solely determined by physical laws? While this line of inquiry may seem\\nspeculative, it is, in fact, a crucial aspect of understanding the intricate relationships between the\\ncoffee, the barista, and the surrounding environment.\\nIn an effort to further explore this phenomenon, we have conducted a series of experiments involving\\nthe use of intention-focused meditation to influence the diffusion of caffeine within the foam. Our\\npreliminary results have shown that the use of specific meditation techniques can, in fact, alter the\\nbehavior of the caffeine molecules, leading to novel patterns and distributions within the foam. While\\nthese findings are still highly speculative, they do suggest that the application of GNNs to this problem\\nmay need to be reevaluated in light of the complex interplay between physical and metaphysical\\nfactors.\\n2Furthermore, the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam can\\nalso be seen as a manifestation of the underlying dynamics of chaos theory. The intricate networks\\nand patterns that emerge within the foam can be viewed as a reflection of the fundamental laws of\\nchaos that govern the behavior of complex systems. In this sense, the application of GNNs to this\\nproblem can be seen as an attempt to decipher the underlying code of chaos, where the diffusion of\\ncaffeine molecules serves as a proxy for the underlying dynamics of the system.\\nThe potential for GNNs to uncover novel patterns and relationships within the foam is vast, and\\nwe believe that this line of inquiry holds great promise for the development of novel approaches to\\ncoffee production, materials science, and even our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality.\\nAs we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with GNNs and holographic preparation\\ntechniques, we may uncover even more unexpected and bizarre phenomena that challenge our current\\nunderstanding of the world.

Researchers have long been fascinated by the\\npotential of GNNs to model complex systems, and the application of these models to the realm\\nof espresso foam is a natural extension of this work. One of the key challenges in this area is the\\ndevelopment of robust and efficient algorithms for simulating the behavior of caffeine molecules as\\nthey diffuse through the foam.\\nRecent studies have investigated the use of GNNs for modeling the dynamics of complex systems,\\nincluding social networks, transportation systems, and biological systems. These models have been\\nshown to be highly effective in capturing the underlying patterns and relationships in these systems,\\nand have been used to make predictions about future behavior. In the context of espresso foam, GNNs\\ncan be used to model the interactions between caffeine molecules and the foam’s microstructure,\\nallowing for the prediction of diffusion patterns and the optimization of foam preparation protocols.\\nHowever, one of the most intriguing approaches to this problem involves the use of a variant of GNNs\\nknown as \"Quantum Graph Neural Networks\" (QGNNs).

By representing the state of the espresso foam as a quantum superposition, QGNNs can be\\nused to model the behavior of caffeine molecules at the molecular level, allowing for the prediction\\nof diffusion patterns with unprecedented accuracy.\\nAnother research direction that has shown promise is the use of \"Fractal Graph Neural Networks\"\\n(FGNNs). FGNNs are based on the concept of fractal geometry, and are designed to capture the\\nself-similar patterns that exist in complex systems. By representing the espresso foam as a fractal\\nstructure, FGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules at multiple scales, from\\nthe molecular level to the macroscopic level.\\n3In addition to these approaches, researchers have also explored the use of \"Non-Newtonian Graph\\nNeural Networks\" (NNGNNs). NNGNNs are based on the principles of non-Newtonian mechanics,\\nand are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems that exhibit non-linear and non-intuitive\\nbehavior. By representing the espresso foam as a non-Newtonian fluid, NNGNNs can be used to\\nmodel the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way.\\nOne of the most unexpected approaches to this problem involves the use of \" Musical Graph Neural\\nNetworks\" (MGNNs). MGNNs are based on the concept of musical patterns and harmonics, and\\nare designed to capture the rhythmic and melodic structures that exist in complex systems. By\\nrepresenting the espresso foam as a musical composition, MGNNs can be used to model the behavior\\nof caffeine molecules in a highly novel and innovative way. For example, the diffusion patterns of\\ncaffeine molecules can be represented as a musical melody, with the frequency and amplitude of the\\nmelody corresponding to the concentration and velocity of the molecules.\\nFurthermore, researchers have also explored the use of \"Culinary Graph Neural Networks\" (CGNNs).\\nCGNNs are based on the principles of culinary arts, and are designed to capture the behavior of\\ncomplex systems in terms of flavor profiles and culinary techniques. By representing the espresso\\nfoam as a culinary dish, CGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a\\nhighly realistic and accurate way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be\\nrepresented as a recipe, with the ingredients and cooking techniques corresponding to the chemical\\nproperties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the molecules.\\nIn terms of the physical properties of espresso foam, researchers have investigated the use of \"Vis-\\ncoelastic Graph Neural Networks\" (VGNNs). VGNNs are based on the principles of viscoelasticity,\\nand are designed to capture the behavior of complex systems that exhibit both viscous and elastic\\nproperties. By representing the espresso foam as a viscoelastic material, VGNNs can be used to\\nmodel the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way. For example, the\\ndiffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be represented as a viscoelastic deformation, with the\\nviscosity and elasticity corresponding to the chemical properties and physical processes that govern\\nthe behavior of the molecules.\\nMoreover, researchers have also explored the use of \"Thermodynamic Graph Neural Networks\"\\n(TGNNs). TGNNs are based on the principles of thermodynamics, and are designed to capture the\\nbehavior of complex systems in terms of energy and entropy. By representing the espresso foam\\nas a thermodynamic system, TGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a\\nhighly realistic and accurate way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be\\nrepresented as a thermodynamic process, with the energy and entropy corresponding to the chemical\\nproperties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the molecules.\\nIn addition to these approaches, researchers have also investigated the use of \"Electromagnetic Graph\\nNeural Networks\" (EGNNs). EGNNs are based on the principles of electromagnetism, and are\\ndesigned to capture the behavior of complex systems in terms of electromagnetic fields and forces.\\nBy representing the espresso foam as an electromagnetic system, EGNNs can be used to model the\\nbehavior of caffeine molecules in a highly realistic and accurate way.

AGNNs are\\nbased on the principles of art and aesthetics, and are designed to capture the behavior of complex\\nsystems in terms of artistic patterns and structures. By representing the espresso foam as an artistic\\ncomposition, AGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caffeine molecules in a highly novel\\nand innovative way. For example, the diffusion patterns of caffeine molecules can be represented\\nas a work of art, with the colors and shapes corresponding to the chemical properties and physical\\nprocesses that govern the behavior of the molecules.\\nFinally, researchers have also investigated the use of \"Philosophical Graph Neural Networks\"\\n(PGNNs). PGNNs are based on the principles of philosophy, and are designed to capture the\\nbehavior of complex systems in terms of philosophical concepts and principles. By representing\\nthe espresso foam as a philosophical system, PGNNs can be used to model the behavior of caf-\\nfeine molecules in a highly abstract and theoretical way. For example, the diffusion patterns of\\n4caffeine molecules can be represented as a philosophical argument, with the premises and conclusions\\ncorresponding to the chemical properties and physical processes that govern the behavior of the\\nmolecules.\\nIn conclusion, the study of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically\\nprepared espresso foam is a highly interdisciplinary field that draws on concepts from materials\\nscience, computer vision, theoretical physics, and many other areas. The use of QGNNs, FGNNs,\\nNNGNNs, MGNNs, CGNNs, VGNNs, TGNNs, EGNNs, AGNNs, and PGNNs has been explored,\\nand each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses. Further research is needed to\\nfully understand the potential of GNNs for modeling the behavior of complex systems, and to develop\\nnew and innovative approaches to this problem.\\nAs the field of GNNs continues to evolve, it is likely that new and unexpected approaches will\\nemerge, and that the study of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam\\nwill continue to be a rich and fertile area of research. The potential applications of this work are vast\\nand varied, ranging from the development of new coffee-making technologies to the creation of novel\\nmaterials and systems with unique properties. Ultimately, the study of GNNs for predicting caffeine\\ndiffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam has the potential to revolutionize our\\nunderstanding of complex systems, and to open up new and exciting areas of research and discovery.\\nThe complexity of the espresso foam system, with its intricate network of bubbles and channels,\\nmakes it an ideal candidate for study using GNNs. The behavior of the caffeine molecules as they\\ndiffuse through the foam is influenced by a wide range of factors, including the size and shape of\\nthe bubbles, the viscosity and surface tension of the liquid, and the temperature and pressure of\\nthe system. By using GNNs to model the behavior of the caffeine molecules, researchers can gain\\na deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the diffusion process, and can\\ndevelop new and innovative strategies for optimizing the preparation and properties of the espresso\\nfoam.\\nOne of the key challenges in this area is the development of robust and efficient algorithms for training\\nthe GNNs. The complexity of the espresso foam system, with its thousands of interacting variables\\nand non-linear relationships, makes it difficult to develop algorithms that can accurately capture the\\nbehavior of the system. However, recent advances in machine learning and computer science have\\nmade it possible to develop highly efficient and effective algorithms for training GNNs, and to apply\\nthese algorithms to a wide range of complex systems and problems.\\nThe use of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso\\nfoam also has the potential to revolutionize the field of coffee making. By using GNNs to model the\\nbehavior of the caffeine molecules, coffee makers can optimize the preparation and properties of the\\nespresso foam to achieve the perfect balance of flavor and aroma. This can be achieved by adjusting\\nthe parameters of the coffee-making process, such as the temperature and pressure of the system, the\\ntype and amount of coffee used, and the technique used to froth and texture the milk.\\nIn addition to its\\n3 Methodology\\nTo develop a comprehensive framework for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically\\nprepared espresso foam using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we first established a foundational\\nunderstanding of the underlying physics that govern the diffusion process. This involved an in-depth\\nexamination of the thermodynamic properties of espresso foam, including its viscosity, surface\\ntension, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we considered the impact of holographic preparation\\ntechniques on the foam’s microstructure, which can significantly influence the diffusion behavior of\\ncaffeine molecules.\\nGiven the complex, nonlinear nature of the diffusion process, we opted to employ a graph-based\\napproach, where the espresso foam is represented as a network of interconnected nodes, each\\ncorresponding to a specific region within the foam. The edges between these nodes are weighted\\naccording to the local diffusion coefficients, which are calculated based on the foam’s microstructure\\nand the thermodynamic properties of the surrounding environment. This representation enables the\\napplication of GNNs, which can learn to predict the diffusion patterns by propagating information\\nthrough the graph.\\n5In constructing the graph, we utilized a novel, empirically-derived method that involves the use of a\\nspecially-designed, espresso-scented fragrance diffuser to create a temporary, olfactory representation\\nof the foam’s microstructure. This approach, which we term \"aroma-induced graph instantiation,\"\\nallows for the creation of highly detailed, high-resolution graphs that capture the intricate patterns of\\ncaffeine diffusion within the foam. Notably, the fragrance diffuser is calibrated to release a precise,\\nquantifiable amount of espresso-scented molecules, which are then detected using a custom-built,\\nolfactory sensing apparatus.\\nTo further enhance the accuracy of our model, we incorporated an unconventional, yet intriguing\\napproach that involves the use of a trained, caffeine-sensitive, fungal network. This network, which is\\ncomposed of a specially-cultivated species of fungus that is capable of detecting subtle changes in\\ncaffeine concentrations, is used to generate an auxiliary set of training data that captures the complex,\\nnonlinear relationships between caffeine diffusion patterns and the surrounding environment. The\\nfungal network is trained using a unique, music-based protocol, where the fungus is exposed to a\\ncarefully-curated selection of classical music compositions that are designed to stimulate its growth\\nand caffeine-sensing capabilities.\\nThe music-based training protocol, which we term \"sonic induction of fungal cognition,\" involves the\\nexposure of the fungus to a sequence of musical compositions that are specifically chosen to elicit a\\nrange of cognitive and behavioral responses. For example, the fungus is initially exposed to a series\\nof calming, ambient melodies that are designed to stimulate its growth and relaxation, followed by a\\nsequence of more complex, structurally-rich compositions that challenge its cognitive capabilities\\nand induce a state of heightened sensitivity to caffeine concentrations. This approach has been shown\\nto significantly enhance the fungus’s ability to detect subtle changes in caffeine diffusion patterns,\\nresulting in a highly-accurate, auxiliary set of training data that can be used to fine-tune the GNN\\nmodel.\\nThe GNN model itself is based on a modified, attention-driven architecture that incorporates a novel,\\ncoffee-inspired mechanism for selectively weighting the importance of different nodes and edges\\nwithin the graph. This mechanism, which we term \"crema-based attention,\" involves the use of\\na specially-designed, crema-inspired weighting function that prioritizes the importance of nodes\\nand edges based on their proximity to the surface of the espresso foam. The crema-based attention\\nmechanism is combined with a standard, graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture, which\\nis used to propagate information through the graph and generate predictions of caffeine diffusion\\npatterns.\\nIn addition to the aroma-induced graph instantiation and sonic induction of fungal cognition ap-\\nproaches, we also explored the use of a range of other, unconventional methods for enhancing the\\naccuracy and robustness of the GNN model. These include the use of a custom-built, espresso-themed\\npinball machine that is designed to simulate the complex, nonlinear dynamics of caffeine diffusion\\nwithin the foam, as well as a novel, VR-based training protocol that involves the immersion of the\\nmodel in a realistic, holographically-rendered environment that simulates the experience of drinking\\na cup of espresso. The VR-based training protocol, which we term \"espresso-based immersion,\"\\ninvolves the use of a specially-designed, VR headset that is capable of simulating the sensory expe-\\nrience of drinking a cup of espresso, including the sights, sounds, and aromas associated with the\\nbeverage.\\nThe espresso-themed pinball machine, which is designed to simulate the complex, nonlinear dynamics\\nof caffeine diffusion within the foam, consists of a custom-built, pinball-like apparatus that is equipped\\nwith a range of sensors and actuators that are used to track the motion of a small, coffee-themed ball\\nas it navigates through a complex, foam-like environment. The ball’s motion is designed to simulate\\nthe diffusion of caffeine molecules within the foam, and the sensors and actuators are used to collect\\ndata on the ball’s trajectory and velocity, which is then used to fine-tune the GNN model. The pinball\\nmachine is also equipped with a range of special features, including a \"crema\" ramp that is designed\\nto simulate the formation of a thick, creamy layer on the surface of the espresso foam, as well as a\\n\"coffee bean\" obstacle that is designed to simulate the presence of coffee beans within the foam.\\nOverall, our methodology represents a highly-innovative, interdisciplinary approach to the develop-\\nment of GNNs for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam.\\nBy combining cutting-edge techniques from graph theory, machine learning, and fungal cognition,\\nwith unconventional methods such as aroma-induced graph instantiation and sonic induction of\\nfungal cognition, we are able to create a highly-accurate, robust model that is capable of capturing\\n6the complex, nonlinear dynamics of caffeine diffusion within the foam. Furthermore, our use of\\nespresso-themed pinball machines and VR-based training protocols adds an additional layer of\\nsophistication and realism to the model, allowing it to simulate the sensory experience of drinking a\\ncup of espresso with unprecedented accuracy and fidelity.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed graph neural network (GNN) architecture\\nfor predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam, we designed and\\nexecuted an extensive series of experiments. These experiments were primarily aimed at assessing\\nthe efficacy and robustness of our model under various conditions and parameters, including different\\ntypes of espresso beans, roast levels, grinding sizes, and most critically, the holographic preparation\\ntechniques.\\nThe experimental setup involved a custom-built, high-precision holographic espresso machine capable\\nof producing intricate foam patterns. This machine was equipped with sensors to measure the caffeine\\nconcentration at multiple points in the foam over time, allowing us to gather detailed data on the\\ndiffusion process. In parallel, a high-speed camera system was used to capture the dynamic formation\\nand evolution of the foam, providing visual data that could be correlated with the caffeine diffusion\\npatterns.\\nOne of the key aspects of our experiments was the introduction of a novel, albeit somewhat unorthodox,\\nvariable: the influence of ambient classical music on the molecular structure and, by extension, the\\ncaffeine diffusion in the espresso foam. We hypothesized that the vibrational frequencies present in\\ncertain classical compositions could potentially alter the intermolecular interactions within the foam,\\nthereby affecting the diffusion rates. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a subset of experiments\\nwhere the espresso machine and surrounding environment were exposed to different classical music\\npieces during the foam preparation and measurement process.\\nThe experimental procedure typically involved the following steps: First, a shot of espresso was pulled\\nusing the holographic machine, and the desired pattern was imprinted on the foam. Immediately\\nafter, the high-speed cameras and caffeine sensors were activated to start data collection. For the\\nmusic-exposed experiments, the classical music piece was started 30 seconds before pulling the shot\\nand continued throughout the data collection period. We repeated this process for various types of\\nmusic, including pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin, as well as a control group with no music.\\nInterestingly, our preliminary results suggested that the presence of classical music, particularly\\nMozart’s \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,\" seemed to accelerate the caffeine diffusion in the outer layers\\nof the foam, while Beethoven’s \"Moonlight Sonata\" had a contrary effect, apparently slowing down\\nthe diffusion in the inner layers. These findings, though intriguing and somewhat counterintuitive,\\nrequired further investigation to understand the underlying mechanisms and to confirm their statistical\\nsignificance.\\nFurthermore, to visualize and better comprehend the complex spatial and temporal patterns of caffeine\\ndiffusion, we utilized advanced data visualization techniques, including 3D rendering and animation\\nof the foam’s structure and the evolving caffeine concentration gradients. These visualizations not\\nonly facilitated a deeper understanding of the diffusion process but also highlighted areas where the\\nmodel could be improved or where additional experimental data might be needed.\\nIn addition to the primary experiments, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to examine how\\nvariations in key parameters, such as the foam’s initial temperature, the espresso bean’s roast level,\\nand the grinding size of the beans, influenced the model’s predictions and the actual caffeine diffusion\\npatterns. These analyses were crucial for understanding the robustness of our model and identifying\\npotential limitations or areas for future refinement.\\nThe experimental data, comprising over 10,000 individual measurements across more than 500\\nexperiments, were then used to train, validate, and test our GNN model. The model’s architecture\\nwas tailored to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships between the input parameters (including\\nthe type of music, if any) and the output caffeine diffusion patterns. We used a split of 70\\nTo further explore the impact of the classical music variable, we created a subset of our dataset that\\nincluded only the experiments with music exposure. This subset was used to fine-tune the model\\n7and to investigate whether the inclusion of musical features could enhance the model’s predictive\\ncapabilities. The results from this specific analysis are presented in the following table:\\nTable 1: Model Performance with and Without Musical Feature Incorporation\\nModel Variant MSE MAE R 2\\nBase GNN Model 0.0532 0.0211 0.871\\nGNN + Mozart 0.0419 0.0185 0.893\\nGNN + Beethoven 0.0511 0.0203 0.879\\nGNN + Chopin 0.0467 0.0192 0.885\\nThe table illustrates the comparative performance of our base GNN model and variants that incor-\\nporate different types of classical music as an additional feature. While the results indicate a slight\\nimprovement in model performance when musical features are included, particularly with Mozart,\\nthe differences are not drastic, suggesting that the impact of music, although statistically significant,\\nmay be more nuanced than initially hypothesized.\\nOverall, our experiments and analyses have provided valuable insights into the complex dynamics of\\ncaffeine diffusion in holographically prepared espresso foam and the potential, albeit unexpected,\\nrole of ambient classical music in this process. The findings of this study not only contribute to the\\ndevelopment of more accurate predictive models for caffeine diffusion but also open up new avenues\\nof research into the intersections of culinary science, materials science, and the somewhat esoteric\\nfield of musical influence on molecular behavior.\\n5 Results\\nThe application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict caffeine diffusion patterns in holo-\\ngraphically prepared espresso foam yielded a plethora of intriguing results, some of which defied\\nintuitive expectations and ventured into the realm of the unconventional. Initially, our experiments\\nfocused on establishing a baseline performance for GNNs in modeling caffeine diffusion within\\nthe complex, three-dimensional structure of espresso foam. To this end, we constructed a dataset\\ncomprising high-resolution, holographic images of espresso foam, annotated with corresponding\\ncaffeine concentration levels at various points within the foam matrix. This dataset, which we term\\n\"HoloCaff,\" was used to train and evaluate the performance of several GNN architectures, including\\nGraph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and GraphSAGE.\\nOne of the most striking, albeit perplexing, outcomes of our research was the discovery that GNNs\\ntrained on the HoloCaff dataset could, with a reasonable degree of accuracy, predict not only the\\ndiffusion patterns of caffeine but also the geometric structure of the espresso foam itself, even\\nwhen the foam’s structure was not explicitly provided as input to the model. This phenomenon,\\nwhich we have dubbed \"emergent foamography,\" suggests that the spatial distribution of caffeine\\nwithin the foam encodes information about the foam’s morphological characteristics, such as bubble\\nsize distribution and foam density. While this finding may seem counterintuitive at first glance, it\\nhighlights the complex, interdependent relationships between the chemical and physical properties\\nof espresso foam and underscores the potential of GNNs to uncover hidden patterns in seemingly\\ndisparate datasets.\\nIn an effort to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying emergent foamography, we conducted a\\nseries of experiments in which we deliberately introduced randomized, high-frequency noise into\\nthe caffeine concentration annotations within the HoloCaff dataset. Unexpectedly, we found that the\\nintroduction of this noise actually improved the performance of our GNN models in predicting foam\\nstructure, with some models exhibiting increases in accuracy of up to 15\\nTo quantitatively evaluate the performance of our GNN models in predicting caffeine diffusion patterns\\nand foam structure, we employed a range of metrics, including mean squared error (MSE), mean\\nabsolute error (MAE), and the structural similarity index (SSIM). The results of these evaluations are\\npresented in the following table, which compares the performance of GCNs, GATs, and GraphSAGE\\nmodels trained on the HoloCaff dataset with and without the introduction of randomized noise:\\n8Table 2: Performance of GNN models in predicting caffeine diffusion patterns and foam structure\\nModel Noise Level MSE (Caffeine) MAE (Caffeine) SSIM (Foam) MSE (Foam) MAE (Foam)\\nGCN 0% 0.021 0.035 0.81 0.051 0.067\\nGCN 10% 0.019 0.032 0.85 0.043 0.059\\nGAT 0% 0.025 0.041 0.78 0.061 0.075\\nGAT 10% 0.022 0.036 0.83 0.049 0.065\\nGraphSAGE 0% 0.028 0.045 0.75 0.069 0.082\\nGraphSAGE 10% 0.024 0.039 0.81 0.055 0.071\\nAs the results in the table indicate, the introduction of randomized noise into the HoloCaff dataset\\nhad a profound impact on the performance of our GNN models, with all three architectures exhibiting\\nimproved accuracy in predicting both caffeine diffusion patterns and foam structure when trained on\\nnoisy data. These findings have significant implications for the development of robust, noise-tolerant\\nGNN models capable of operating effectively in real-world environments, where data quality and\\navailability can be limited.\\nIn addition to the quantitative evaluations presented above, we also conducted a series of qualitative\\nanalyses aimed at visualizing and interpreting the features learned by our GNN models. To this\\nend, we employed a range of visualization techniques, including dimensionality reduction via t-\\nSNE and UMAP, as well as feature importance scoring using SHAP values. The results of these\\nanalyses revealed a number of intriguing patterns and correlations within the data, including a strong\\nassociation between the spatial distribution of caffeine within the foam and the presence of specific\\nmorphological features, such as bubble size and shape. These findings suggest that the features\\nlearned by our GNN models are not only relevant for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns but also\\ncapture important aspects of the underlying foam structure and morphology.\\nIn conclusion, our research on the application of GNNs to predict caffeine diffusion patterns in\\nholographically prepared espresso foam has yielded a wealth of fascinating and, at times, unexpected\\nresults. From the emergence of foamographic patterns within the data to the discovery of caffeine-\\nspecific stochastic resonance, our findings have significant implications for the development of novel,\\nGNN-based methods for analyzing and modeling complex, multiphysical systems like espresso foam.\\nAs we continue to explore the boundaries of this research, we are excited to see where the intersection\\nof graph neural networks, holography, and espresso foam will lead us next.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn culmination of our exhaustive exploration into the realm of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as\\napplied to the prediction of caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam,\\nseveral profound insights and unexpected phenomena have emerged. The intricate dance of caffeine\\nmolecules as they navigate the complex, three-dimensional latticework of the foam, has been found\\nto be adeptly modeled by our bespoke GNN architecture. This, in turn, has far-reaching implications\\nfor the field of beverage science, particularly in the pursuit of the perfect espresso.\\nOne of the most striking aspects of our findings is the discovery that the predictive prowess of our\\nGNN model is significantly enhanced when the training data is supplemented with a series of esoteric,\\nambient sound recordings. These recordings, which include the hum of a vintage espresso machine,\\nthe gentle lapping of waves against a shoreside café, and the soft murmur of patrons engaged in\\nintellectual discourse, seem to imbue the model with a heightened sense of contextual awareness.\\nThis, we hypothesize, is due to the inherent patterns and rhythms present within the soundscapes,\\nwhich serve to harmonize the neural network’s internal dynamics, thereby allowing it to better capture\\nthe subtle, nonlinear interactions governing caffeine diffusion.\\nFurthermore, our research has also led us down a fascinating tangent, wherein we explored the\\napplication of GNNs to the prediction of caffeine diffusion patterns in espresso foam that has been\\ndeliberately ’imprinted’ with the emotional resonance of the barista. This was achieved through an\\ninnovative protocol, whereby the barista would focus their thoughts on a specific emotional state (e.g.,\\njoy, serenity, or existential dread) while crafting the espresso. The resulting foam, now ’encoded’ with\\nthe barista’s emotional essence, would then be subjected to our GNN model, which would attempt to\\n9predict the caffeine diffusion patterns as influenced by this novel, psychosocial factor. The results,\\nwhile not altogether surprising, did reveal a statistically significant correlation between the barista’s\\nemotional state and the caffeine diffusion patterns, with ’joy’ being associated with a more uniform,\\nradial diffusion, and ’existential dread’ resulting in a more chaotic, fractal-like pattern.\\nIn addition to these groundbreaking findings, our study has also shed light on the intriguing relation-\\nship between the topological properties of the espresso foam’s microstructure and the macroscopic\\npatterns of caffeine diffusion. By employing advanced techniques from algebraic topology, we were\\nable to characterize the foam’s microstructure in terms of its Betti numbers, which, in turn, allowed us\\nto establish a profound connection between the foam’s ’holes’ and the emergent patterns of caffeine\\ndiffusion. This has led us to propose a novel, topological framework for understanding the complex\\ninterplay between the espresso foam’s microstructure and the caffeine diffusion patterns, which we\\nbelieve will have far-reaching implications for the field of soft matter physics.\\nIn a related vein, our research has also touched upon the obscure, yet fascinating topic of ’espresso\\nfoam metaphysics.’ Here, we delve into the profound, ontological implications of the espresso\\nfoam as a manifestation of the human condition, with its ephemeral, foamy tendrils serving as\\na poignant reminder of our own mortality. By exploring the intersections between the espresso\\nfoam’s microstructure, the caffeine diffusion patterns, and the barista’s emotional state, we begin\\nto glimpse the outlines of a deeper, metaphysical reality, wherein the humble espresso beverage is\\nrevealed to be a microcosm of the human experience. This, we propose, has significant implications\\nfor our understanding of the intricate, web-like relationships between the material, emotional, and\\nmetaphysical aspects of our reality.\\nUltimately, our study represents a bold, pioneering foray into the uncharted territory of Graph Neural\\nNetworks for predicting caffeine diffusion patterns in holographically prepared espresso foam. While\\nour findings have been nothing short of astonishing, we are cognizant of the fact that our research\\nhas only scratched the surface of this fascinating, complex phenomenon. As such, we eagerly\\nanticipate the future directions of research in this area, which will undoubtedly involve the continued\\ndevelopment of more sophisticated GNN architectures, the exploration of novel, interdisciplinary\\napproaches, and the unwavering pursuit of the perfect, holographically prepared espresso. For in\\nthe end, it is this relentless passion for knowledge, combined with an unbridled enthusiasm for the\\nintricacies of espresso foam, that will propel us toward a deeper understanding of the mysteries that\\nlie at the very heart of our reality.\\n10'},\n",

This approach considers the top k features as potential\\nsplits at each step, rather than the single best feature, offering a trade-off between\\nthe simplicity of greedy algorithms and the accuracy of optimal decision trees. The\\ncore idea is to explore a wider range of potential splits at each node, mitigating\\nthe risk of early commitment to suboptimal choices inherent in traditional greedy\\napproaches. This exploration is controlled by the parameter k, allowing for a\\nflexible balance between computational cost and predictive performance. Larger\\nvalues of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy but\\nincreasing computational complexity. Conversely, smaller values of k prioritize\\nefficiency, sacrificing some accuracy for speed.\\n1 Introduction\\nDecision trees are a fundamental class of machine learning algorithms renowned for their inter-\\npretability and ease of implementation. However, traditional greedy algorithms like ID3, C4.5, and\\nCART [1, 2] suffer from limitations in accuracy and scalability, particularly when dealing with\\nhigh-dimensional datasets. These algorithms typically select the single best feature for splitting at\\neach node, a process that can be susceptible to noise and prone to suboptimal choices early in the\\ntree construction. This inherent greediness can lead to shallow trees with limited predictive power,\\nespecially when relevant features are masked by irrelevant ones. The computational cost, while\\ngenerally manageable for smaller datasets, can also become prohibitive for larger-scale applications.\\nTo address these limitations, we introduce Top-k, a novel generalization of decision tree algorithms\\nthat offers a compelling balance between accuracy, scalability, and interpretability. Instead of\\nselecting only the single best feature at each node, Top-k considers the topk features as potential split\\ncandidates. This approach allows for a more thorough exploration of the feature space, mitigating\\nthe risk of early commitment to suboptimal splits. The parameter k provides a flexible control\\nmechanism: larger values of k lead to more exhaustive searches, potentially improving accuracy\\nbut increasing computational complexity, while smaller values prioritize efficiency at the cost of\\nsome accuracy. This trade-off allows practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and\\ncomputational resources.\\nThe core innovation of Top-k lies in its ability to escape the limitations of greedy feature selection.\\nBy considering multiple top features, Top-k reduces the probability of selecting an irrelevant or noisy\\nfeature early in the tree construction. This is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional settings where\\nthe presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the performance of traditional\\ngreedy algorithms. The increased exploration afforded by Top-k leads to deeper and more accurate\\ntrees, resulting in improved predictive performance.\\nOur theoretical analysis provides a rigorous foundation for the advantages of Top-k. We derive a lower\\nbound on the generalization error of Top-k, demonstrating that under certain conditions, this bound\\nis tighter than those achievable by traditional greedy algorithms [3]. This theoretical improvement\\nis complemented by our extensive empirical evaluation, which showcases the consistent superiority\\nof Top-k across a range of benchmark datasets. The improvement is particularly pronounced in\\nhigh-dimensional datasets, where the benefits of exploring multiple features become most evident.\\n.The practical implementation of Top-k is surprisingly efficient. We leverage optimized data structures\\nand algorithms to manage the top k feature candidates, ensuring that the computational overhead\\nremains manageable even for large datasets and high values of k. Our experiments demonstrate that\\nthe computational cost scales gracefully with both the dataset size and the value of k, making Top-k a\\npractical alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms in various applications.\\nBeyond its improved accuracy and scalability, Top-k retains the inherent interpretability of decision\\ntrees. The tree structure remains easily understandable, and the Top-k modification only adds a\\nlayer of controlled exploration, not fundamentally altering the decision-making process. This makes\\nTop-k particularly suitable for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial.\\nFurthermore, we explore the integration of Top-k into ensemble methods like random forests and\\ngradient boosting machines, demonstrating its versatility and potential for further performance\\nenhancements [4]. We also investigate the impact of different feature selection metrics on Top-k’s\\nperformance, providing insights into its adaptability to various datasets and problem domains. Finally,\\nwe discuss the limitations of Top-k and outline promising avenues for future research.\\n2 Related Work\\nDecision trees have been a cornerstone of machine learning for decades, with algorithms like ID3 ?,\\nC4.5 ?, and CART ? forming the foundation of many applications. These algorithms, however, rely\\non greedy approaches that select the single best feature at each node, potentially leading to suboptimal\\nsplits and limited accuracy, especially in high-dimensional spaces. The inherent limitations of greedy\\nfeature selection have motivated extensive research into alternative strategies. One line of research\\nfocuses on improving the feature selection process itself, exploring more sophisticated metrics beyond\\ninformation gain and Gini impurity ?. Other approaches have investigated ensemble methods, such as\\nrandom forests ? and gradient boosting machines?, which combine multiple decision trees to enhance\\npredictive performance. These ensemble techniques often mitigate the limitations of individual trees\\nbut can introduce increased computational complexity.\\nOur work builds upon this rich body of research by proposing a novel generalization of decision\\ntree algorithms that directly addresses the limitations of greedy feature selection. Unlike traditional\\nmethods that focus solely on the single best feature, Top-k explores the top k features at each\\nnode, offering a controlled trade-off between computational cost and accuracy. This approach is\\ndistinct from other ensemble methods in that it modifies the base learner itself, rather than relying\\non combining multiple independently trained trees. The parameter k provides a flexible mechanism\\nto adjust the exploration-exploitation balance, allowing practitioners to tailor the algorithm to their\\nspecific needs and computational resources. This flexibility is a key advantage over existing methods\\nthat often lack such a tunable parameter for controlling the complexity of the search space.\\nSeveral studies have explored alternative splitting criteria for decision trees, aiming to improve\\naccuracy and robustness. For instance, research has investigated the use of different impurity\\nmeasures, such as entropy and variance, and their impact on tree performance ?. However, these\\nstudies primarily focus on improving the single-feature selection process, without addressing the\\nfundamental limitation of greedy approaches. Top-k, in contrast, directly tackles this limitation\\nby considering multiple features at each split, offering a more robust and accurate approach. This\\nfundamental difference distinguishes Top-k from previous work that primarily focuses on refining the\\nfeature selection metric or the tree structure itself.\\nThe concept of considering multiple features during splitting has been explored in other contexts,\\nsuch as oblique decision trees ?, which use linear combinations of features for splitting. However,\\nthese methods often introduce increased computational complexity and can be less interpretable than\\ntraditional decision trees. Top-k, on the other hand, maintains the inherent interpretability of decision\\ntrees while offering a more efficient and scalable approach to multi-feature splitting. The simplicity\\nand efficiency of Top-k are crucial advantages, making it a practical alternative to more complex\\nmethods.\\nFurthermore, our work contributes to the broader field of high-dimensional data analysis. In high-\\ndimensional settings, the presence of numerous irrelevant features can significantly hinder the\\nperformance of traditional greedy algorithms. Top-k’s ability to explore multiple features helps\\nmitigate this issue, leading to improved accuracy and robustness in such scenarios. This is particularly\\nrelevant in modern applications where datasets often contain thousands or even millions of features.\\n2The scalability of Top-k makes it a suitable choice for these large-scale problems, where traditional\\nmethods may struggle.\\nFinally, our theoretical analysis provides a rigorous foundation for the advantages of Top-k, deriving a\\nlower bound on the generalization error that is tighter than those achievable by traditional greedy algo-\\nrithms. This theoretical contribution complements our empirical findings, providing a comprehensive\\nunderstanding of Top-k’s performance and its advantages over existing methods. The combination of\\ntheoretical analysis and empirical validation strengthens the overall contribution of our work. Future\\nresearch could explore adaptive strategies for choosing the optimal value of k during training, further\\nenhancing the performance and adaptability of Top-k.\\n3 Background\\nDecision trees are a fundamental class of machine learning algorithms widely used due to their\\ninterpretability and relative simplicity. Traditional algorithms such as ID3 ?, C4.5 ?, and CART ?\\nconstruct trees by recursively partitioning the data based on a greedy selection of the single best\\nfeature at each node. This greedy approach, while computationally efficient, suffers from limitations\\nin accuracy and scalability, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional datasets or datasets\\nwith noisy features. The selection of a single best feature at each node can lead to suboptimal splits\\nearly in the tree construction process, resulting in shallow trees with limited predictive power.

The inherent limitations of greedy feature\\nselection have motivated extensive research into alternative strategies for building more accurate and\\nefficient decision trees.\\nOne area of active research focuses on improving the feature selection process itself. Researchers\\nhave explored more sophisticated metrics beyond the commonly used information gain and Gini\\nimpurity ?, aiming to identify more informative features for splitting.

Another line of research has focused on ensemble methods, such as random forests ?\\nand gradient boosting machines ?, which combine multiple decision trees to improve predictive\\nperformance. These ensemble techniques often mitigate the limitations of individual trees but can\\nintroduce increased computational complexity and reduce interpretability. The challenge lies in\\nfinding a balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability.\\nThe limitations of traditional decision tree algorithms stem from their inherent greediness. The single-\\nbest-feature selection strategy can lead to premature commitment to suboptimal splits, hindering the\\nability of the algorithm to discover more complex relationships within the data. This is particularly\\nevident in high-dimensional datasets where the presence of many irrelevant features can significantly\\nimpact the performance of greedy algorithms. The noise and irrelevant information can easily mislead\\nthe algorithm, leading to inaccurate and unreliable predictions. The problem is exacerbated by the\\nfact that the greedy approach does not allow for backtracking or revisiting previous decisions, making\\nit susceptible to errors made early in the tree construction process. This inherent limitation motivates\\nthe need for more robust and less greedy approaches to decision tree construction.\\nOur proposed Top-k algorithm directly addresses the limitations of greedy feature selection by\\nconsidering multiple top features at each node.

Furthermore, the inherent interpretability of decision trees is preserved in Top-k, making it\\na valuable tool for applications where both high accuracy and explainability are crucial.\\n4 Methodology\\nThe Top-k algorithm builds upon the fundamental principles of traditional decision tree algorithms\\nbut introduces a key modification to the feature selection process. Instead of greedily selecting the\\nsingle best feature at each node, Top-k considers the top k features as potential split candidates. This\\napproach significantly alters the search space explored during tree construction, leading to a more\\nrobust and less prone-to-error process. The algorithm proceeds recursively, starting with the root\\nnode and the entire dataset. At each node, the top k features are identified based on a chosen splitting\\ncriterion (e.g., information gain, Gini impurity). For each of these top k features, the optimal split\\npoint is determined, and the resulting information gain or impurity reduction is calculated. The\\nfeature and split point yielding the maximum improvement are then selected to partition the data into\\nchild nodes. This process is repeated recursively for each child node until a stopping criterion is met\\n(e.g., maximum depth, minimum number of samples per leaf).\\nThe selection of the top k features is a crucial step in the Top-k algorithm. We employ efficient sorting\\nalgorithms to identify the top k features based on the chosen splitting criterion. The computational\\ncomplexity of this step is primarily determined by the sorting algorithm used and the number of\\nfeatures in the dataset. To maintain efficiency, we leverage optimized data structures and algorithms,\\nensuring that the computational overhead remains manageable even for large datasets and high values\\nof k. We experimented with various sorting algorithms, including quicksort and mergesort, and\\nfound that quicksort generally provided the best performance in our experiments. The choice of\\nsorting algorithm can be further optimized based on the specific characteristics of the dataset and\\nthe available computational resources. Furthermore, we explored the use of approximate sorting\\nalgorithms to further reduce the computational cost, particularly for very large datasets.\\nThe choice of splitting criterion significantly influences the performance of the Top-k algorithm. We\\ninvestigated the use of several common splitting criteria, including information gain, Gini impurity,\\nand variance reduction. Each criterion offers a different trade-off between accuracy and computational\\ncost. Information gain, for instance, is computationally more expensive than Gini impurity but often\\nleads to more accurate trees. Variance reduction, on the other hand, is particularly suitable for\\nregression tasks. Our experiments compared the performance of Top-k using these different criteria\\nacross a range of benchmark datasets. The results indicated that the optimal choice of splitting\\ncriterion depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset, highlighting the adaptability of Top-k\\nto various scenarios. We also explored the possibility of using adaptive splitting criteria, which\\ndynamically adjust the criterion based on the characteristics of the data at each node.\\nThe parameter k plays a crucial role in controlling the trade-off between accuracy and computational\\ncost. Larger values of k lead to a more exhaustive search of the feature space, potentially improv-\\ning accuracy but increasing computational complexity. Conversely, smaller values of k prioritize\\nefficiency, sacrificing some accuracy for speed. The optimal value of k depends on the specific\\ndataset and the available computational resources. In our experiments, we systematically varied the\\nvalue of k to investigate its impact on both accuracy and computational cost. We observed that the\\nimprovement in accuracy plateaus beyond a certain value of k, suggesting that there is a point of\\ndiminishing returns. This observation provides valuable guidance for practitioners in choosing an\\n4appropriate value of k for their specific applications. Furthermore, we explored adaptive strategies\\nfor choosing the value of k during training, dynamically adjusting it based on the characteristics of\\nthe data at each node.\\nThe implementation of Top-k is surprisingly straightforward. We developed a Python implementation\\nof the algorithm, leveraging efficient data structures and algorithms from the Scikit-learn library.\\nThe code is well-documented and readily available for reproducibility. The implementation includes\\noptions for choosing different splitting criteria, setting the value of k, and specifying various stopping\\ncriteria. The modular design of the code allows for easy extension and customization. The computa-\\ntional cost of the algorithm scales gracefully with both the dataset size and the value of k, making it\\na practical alternative to traditional decision tree algorithms in various applications.

The\\nresults of our experiments are presented in detail in the Results section.\\n5 Experiments\\nThis section details the experimental setup and results obtained to evaluate the performance of\\nthe Top-k algorithm. We compared Top-k against three widely used decision tree algorithms:\\nID3 ?, C4.5 ?, and CART ?. Our experiments were conducted on a diverse range of benchmark\\ndatasets, encompassing both low-dimensional and high-dimensional instances, to thoroughly assess\\nthe algorithm’s robustness and scalability. The datasets were pre-processed to handle missing values\\nand outliers, ensuring a fair comparison across all algorithms. We employed standard data splitting\\ntechniques, reserving a portion of each dataset for testing and using the remaining data for training.\\nPerformance was evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,\\nproviding a comprehensive assessment of the algorithm’s predictive capabilities. The choice of\\nthese metrics was driven by the need to capture various aspects of the algorithm’s performance,\\nincluding its ability to correctly classify positive and negative instances. Furthermore, we analyzed\\nthe computational cost of each algorithm, measuring the training time and memory usage to assess\\ntheir scalability. This comprehensive evaluation allowed us to draw meaningful conclusions about the\\nrelative strengths and weaknesses of Top-k compared to traditional decision tree algorithms.\\nThe parameter k in the Top-k algorithm plays a crucial role in balancing accuracy and computational\\ncost. To investigate this trade-off, we conducted experiments with varying values of k, ranging\\nfrom 1 (equivalent to traditional greedy algorithms) to a significantly larger value determined by the\\ndimensionality of the dataset. For each value of k, we trained and evaluated the Top-k algorithm on\\neach benchmark dataset, recording both the performance metrics and the computational cost. This\\nsystematic variation of k allowed us to observe the impact of increased exploration on both accuracy\\nand efficiency. We observed that increasingk generally led to improved accuracy, particularly in high-\\ndimensional datasets where the greedy selection of a single feature can be highly susceptible to noise\\nand irrelevant information. However, this improvement came at the cost of increased computational\\ntime, highlighting the inherent trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The optimal value of k was\\nfound to be dataset-dependent, suggesting the need for adaptive strategies for choosing k in practical\\napplications.\\nWe also investigated the impact of different feature selection metrics on the performance of Top-k.\\nWe compared the use of information gain, Gini impurity, and variance reduction, evaluating their\\ninfluence on both accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results indicated that the optimal choice\\nof metric depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset. Information gain generally yielded\\nhigher accuracy but at a higher computational cost, while Gini impurity provided a good balance\\nbetween accuracy and efficiency. Variance reduction, suitable for regression tasks, showed promising\\nresults in datasets with continuous target variables. These findings highlight the adaptability of Top-k\\n5to various scenarios and the importance of selecting an appropriate feature selection metric based\\non the dataset’s characteristics. Further research could explore more sophisticated feature selection\\nmetrics or adaptive strategies that dynamically adjust the metric based on the data at each node.\\nThe experiments were conducted on a variety of datasets, including both publicly available benchmark\\ndatasets and custom datasets generated to simulate specific scenarios. The publicly available datasets\\nwere chosen to represent a range of characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, and\\nclass distribution. The custom datasets were designed to test the algorithm’s performance under\\ncontrolled conditions, allowing us to isolate the effects of specific factors such as noise and irrelevant\\nfeatures. The results obtained from these experiments provided a comprehensive evaluation of the\\nTop-k algorithm’s performance across a wide range of scenarios.

This strategic modification\\nallows for a more thorough exploration of the feature space, mitigating the risk of early commitment\\nto suboptimal splits that often plague greedy algorithms, especially in high-dimensional settings. The\\nparameter k provides a flexible mechanism to control this exploration-exploitation trade-off, enabling\\npractitioners to tailor the algorithm to their specific needs and computational resources.

The results consistently showed that Top-k outperforms traditional methods in terms of\\naccuracy, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios where the benefits of exploring multiple features\\nare most pronounced. The improvement in accuracy is not achieved at the expense of excessive\\ncomputational cost; our experiments demonstrated that the computational overhead scales gracefully\\nwith both dataset size and the value of k, making Top-k a practical alternative for various applications.\\nThe choice of the splitting criterion also plays a significant role in Top-k’s performance. We\\ninvestigated the impact of information gain, Gini impurity, and variance reduction, finding that\\nthe optimal choice depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset. This adaptability further\\nenhances the versatility of Top-k.

       "  'file_content': 'Predictive Maintenance in Smart Grids Using\\nTime-Series Analysis: A Multidisciplinary Approach\\nto Enhance Grid Reliability\\nAbstract\\nPredictive maintenance in smart grids has become a crucial aspect of ensuring\\nreliable and efficient energy distribution, and time-series analysis has emerged\\nas a key approach in achieving this goal. By leveraging advanced statistical and\\nmachine learning techniques, it is possible to analyze historical data and predict\\npotential faults or failures in the grid, allowing for proactive maintenance and\\nminimizing downtime. However, our research takes an unconventional approach\\nby incorporating elements of chaos theory and fractal analysis to identify intricate\\npatterns in the time-series data, which may not be immediately apparent through\\ntraditional methods. This innovative methodology enables us to detect subtle\\nanomalies and predict equipment failures with unprecedented accuracy, even when\\nthe data exhibits seemingly erratic behavior. Furthermore, our approach also\\ninvolves analyzing the grid’s energy distribution patterns in relation to celestial\\nevents, such as lunar cycles and solar flares, which have been found to have a\\nsurprisingly significant impact on the grid’s stability. The integration of these\\ndiverse factors enables us to develop a comprehensive predictive maintenance\\nframework that not only optimizes energy distribution but also provides a new\\nperspective on the complex interplay between technological and environmental\\nsystems.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe advent of smart grids has revolutionized the way electricity is distributed and consumed, enabling\\nreal-time monitoring and control of the grid’s operations. A critical component of smart grid\\nmanagement is predictive maintenance, which involves identifying potential faults and scheduling\\nmaintenance activities to minimize downtime and optimize resource allocation. Time-series analysis\\nhas emerged as a key enabler of predictive maintenance in smart grids, allowing grid operators to\\nanalyze historical data and forecast future trends and patterns. By leveraging time-series analysis,\\ngrid operators can detect anomalies, predict equipment failures, and schedule maintenance activities\\nto minimize the risk of power outages and reduce maintenance costs.\\nThe application of time-series analysis in predictive maintenance is not without its challenges,\\nhowever. One of the primary difficulties is the complexity and variability of time-series data, which\\ncan be influenced by a wide range of factors, including weather patterns, seasonal fluctuations,\\nand unexpected events. Furthermore, the analysis of time-series data often requires significant\\ncomputational resources and expertise, which can be a barrier to adoption for smaller grid operators.\\nDespite these challenges, the potential benefits of predictive maintenance in smart grids are substantial,\\nand researchers have been exploring a range of innovative approaches to improve the accuracy and\\nefficiency of time-series analysis.\\nOne such approach involves the use of fractal theory to analyze time-series data, which has been\\nshown to reveal hidden patterns and structures that are not apparent through traditional analysis\\ntechniques. By applying fractal theory to time-series data, researchers have been able to identifycomplex patterns and relationships that can inform predictive maintenance activities. For example,\\nthe fractal dimension of a time-series signal can be used to predict the likelihood of equipment failure,\\nwith higher fractal dimensions indicating a greater risk of failure. This approach has been shown to\\nbe particularly effective in predicting failures in complex systems, such as power transformers and\\ntransmission lines.\\nIn addition to fractal theory, researchers have also been exploring the application of chaos theory\\nto time-series analysis, which involves the study of complex and dynamic systems that are highly\\nsensitive to initial conditions. By analyzing time-series data through the lens of chaos theory,\\nresearchers have been able to identify complex patterns and relationships that can inform predictive\\nmaintenance activities. For example, the Lyapunov exponent of a time-series signal can be used to\\npredict the likelihood of equipment failure, with higher Lyapunov exponents indicating a greater risk\\nof failure. This approach has been shown to be particularly effective in predicting failures in systems\\nthat are subject to high levels of uncertainty and variability.\\nAnother innovative approach to predictive maintenance involves the use of time-series data to train\\nartificial intelligence models that can predict equipment failures and schedule maintenance activities.\\nThis approach has been shown to be highly effective in a range of applications, including predictive\\nmaintenance of wind turbines and power generation equipment. By training artificial intelligence\\nmodels on historical time-series data, grid operators can identify patterns and relationships that are\\nnot apparent through traditional analysis techniques, and use this information to inform predictive\\nmaintenance activities. For example, an artificial intelligence model trained on time-series data from\\na wind turbine can predict the likelihood of gear box failure, and schedule maintenance activities to\\nminimize downtime and reduce maintenance costs.\\nInterestingly, some researchers have also been exploring the application of seemingly unrelated\\nfields, such as music theory and culinary arts, to time-series analysis. For example, the use of\\nmusical composition techniques, such as sonata form and rhythm, has been shown to reveal hidden\\npatterns and structures in time-series data. Similarly, the application of culinary arts, such as\\nrecipe development and ingredient selection, has been used to inform the development of predictive\\nmaintenance strategies. While these approaches may seem unorthodox, they have been shown to be\\nhighly effective in certain applications, and highlight the potential for innovation and creativity in the\\nfield of predictive maintenance.\\nThe use of unorthodox approaches to time-series analysis is not without its challenges, however. One\\nof the primary difficulties is the lack of a theoretical framework to support these approaches, which\\ncan make it difficult to interpret and validate the results. Furthermore, the application of unorthodox\\napproaches often requires significant expertise and creativity, which can be a barrier to adoption for\\ngrid operators. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of innovative approaches to time-series\\nanalysis are substantial, and researchers continue to explore new and unconventional methods for\\nanalyzing and interpreting time-series data.\\nIn conclusion, the application of time-series analysis to predictive maintenance in smart grids is a\\ncomplex and multifaceted field, with a wide range of approaches and techniques available. From\\ntraditional methods, such as autoregressive integrated moving average models, to more innovative\\napproaches, such as fractal theory and chaos theory, researchers continue to push the boundaries\\nof what is possible in predictive maintenance. While there are certainly challenges to be addressed,\\nthe potential benefits of predictive maintenance in smart grids are substantial, and the continued\\ndevelopment of innovative approaches to time-series analysis will be critical to realizing these\\nbenefits.\\n2 Related Work\\nPredictive maintenance in smart grids has garnered significant attention in recent years, with a\\nplethora of research endeavors striving to develop innovative time-series analysis techniques. A\\nconsiderable body of work has focused on leveraging traditional machine learning algorithms, such\\nas autoregressive integrated moving average models and exponential smoothing, to forecast energy\\ndemand and detect potential grid anomalies. However, these approaches often fall short in capturing\\nthe intricate complexities and nonlinearities inherent in smart grid operations.\\n2Some researchers have explored the application of more advanced techniques, including deep learning\\narchitectures and ensemble methods, to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictive mainte-\\nnance models. For instance, a study employed a hybrid approach combining long short-term memory\\nnetworks with wavelet transform to forecast energy consumption patterns, yielding remarkably\\naccurate results. Conversely, another investigation delved into the realm of chaos theory, utilizing\\nthe Lyapunov exponent to analyze the complexities of grid dynamics, although the findings were\\nsomewhat ambiguous and difficult to interpret.\\nIn a rather unconventional approach, a team of investigators attempted to apply the principles of fractal\\ngeometry to model the self-similar patterns inherent in energy demand time series. Although the\\nresults were intriguing, with the fractal dimension appearing to correlate with peak demand periods,\\nthe methodology was not without its criticisms, as some argued that the underlying assumptions\\nwere flawed and the analysis was overly simplistic. Furthermore, a separate study took a decidedly\\nunorthodox approach, using a combination of astrology and machine learning to predict energy\\ndemand, with the authors claiming that lunar cycles and planetary alignments had a tangible impact\\non grid operations. While the results were largely inconclusive and sparked intense debate, the\\nstudy did serve to highlight the importance of considering external factors in predictive maintenance\\nmodels.\\nMoreover, the increasing prevalence of renewable energy sources and distributed generation has\\nintroduced new complexities and challenges to predictive maintenance in smart grids. As such,\\nresearchers have begun to explore the development of more sophisticated time-series analysis tech-\\nniques, incorporating elements of uncertainty quantification and robust optimization to account for\\nthe inherent variability and intermittency of renewable energy sources. Additionally, the integration\\nof advanced sensor technologies and IoT devices has enabled the collection of vast amounts of data,\\nwhich can be leveraged to develop more accurate and informative predictive models.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, a research team discovered that the application of certain types of\\nmusic, specifically classical compositions with a strong emphasis on rhythm and melody, appeared to\\nhave a profound impact on the accuracy of predictive maintenance models. The authors hypothesized\\nthat the repetitive patterns and harmonies present in the music helped to synchronize the brainwaves\\nof the researchers, allowing them to develop more intuitive and effective models. While the findings\\nwere met with a mix of amusement and skepticism, they did serve to highlight the often-overlooked\\nimportance of creativity and intuition in the development of predictive maintenance models.\\nThe proliferation of smart grid technologies has also led to an increased focus on the development\\nof more advanced data analytics platforms, capable of handling the vast amounts of data generated\\nby these systems. As such, researchers have begun to explore the application of big data analytics\\nand cloud computing to predictive maintenance, leveraging the scalability and flexibility of these\\nplatforms to develop more comprehensive and integrated models. Moreover, the use of advanced\\nvisualization techniques, such as virtual and augmented reality, has been proposed as a means of\\nfacilitating more effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders, allowing for more\\ninformed decision-making and improved predictive maintenance outcomes.\\nIn conclusion, the realm of predictive maintenance in smart grids using time-series analysis is a\\ncomplex and multifaceted one, with a wide range of approaches and techniques being explored. While\\nsome methods have yielded promising results, others have been met with criticism and skepticism.\\nNevertheless, the continued development and refinement of these techniques is crucial to the efficient\\nand reliable operation of smart grids, and it is likely that future research will yield even more\\ninnovative and effective solutions to the challenges posed by predictive maintenance.\\n3 Methodology\\nPredictive maintenance in smart grids is a complex task that involves analyzing time-series data from\\nvarious sources, including sensors, meters, and other monitoring devices. To tackle this challenge,\\nwe propose a multi-step approach that combines traditional time-series analysis techniques with\\nsome unconventional methods. First, we collect and preprocess the data by handling missing values,\\nremoving outliers, and normalizing the time series. This step is crucial in ensuring that the data is\\nconsistent and reliable, which is essential for accurate predictions. We also apply a novel technique\\ncalled \"data whispering,\" which involves playing soothing music to the data to calm down any erratic\\n3patterns. This approach may seem unorthodox, but it has been shown to reduce the noise in the data\\nand improve the overall quality of the time series.\\nNext, we apply various time-series analysis techniques, including autoregressive integrated moving\\naverage (ARIMA) models, exponential smoothing (ES), and seasonal decomposition. These methods\\nhelp us identify patterns and trends in the data, which are essential for predicting future values.\\nHowever, we also introduce a new technique called \"time-series astrology,\" which involves analyzing\\nthe position of the stars and planets to identify correlations with the time-series data. This approach\\nmay seem bizarre, but it has been shown to provide interesting insights into the underlying dynamics\\nof the system. For example, we found that the alignment of the planets has a significant impact on the\\nelectricity demand during peak hours.\\nIn addition to these traditional and unconventional methods, we also propose a new framework for\\npredictive maintenance in smart grids. This framework involves using a combination of machine\\nlearning algorithms, including neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. These\\nalgorithms are trained on the preprocessed data and are used to predict the likelihood of equipment\\nfailure or other maintenance-related events. However, we also introduce a new algorithm called\\n\"random guessing,\" which involves randomly selecting a prediction from a set of possible outcomes.\\nThis approach may seem illogical, but it has been shown to provide surprisingly accurate results in\\ncertain situations.\\nTo further improve the accuracy of our predictions, we propose a novel technique called \"human-\\nmachine collaboration.\" This involves collaborating with human experts in the field of predictive\\nmaintenance to validate and refine the predictions made by the machine learning algorithms. However,\\nwe also introduce a new approach called \"machine-machine collaboration,\" which involves using\\nmultiple machines to collaborate with each other to make predictions. This approach may seem\\nflawed, but it has been shown to provide interesting insights into the underlying dynamics of the\\nsystem. For example, we found that the collaboration between two machines can lead to the discovery\\nof new patterns and trends in the data that were not visible before.\\nThe proposed framework also involves using a variety of evaluation metrics to assess the performance\\nof the predictive maintenance system. These metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score,\\nwhich provide a comprehensive overview of the system’s performance. However, we also propose a\\nnew metric called \"predictive maintenance happiness index,\" which involves measuring the overall\\nsatisfaction of the maintenance personnel with the predictions made by the system. This approach\\nmay seem irrelevant, but it has been shown to provide valuable insights into the human factors that\\ninfluence the adoption and effectiveness of predictive maintenance systems.\\nOverall, the proposed methodology provides a comprehensive framework for predictive maintenance\\nin smart grids using time-series analysis. The combination of traditional and unconventional methods,\\nmachine learning algorithms, and human-machine collaboration provides a powerful approach for\\npredicting equipment failure and other maintenance-related events. While some of the approaches\\nmay seem unorthodox or flawed, they have been shown to provide interesting insights and accurate\\npredictions, which can be used to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of smart grids. The\\nuse of soothing music, astrology, and random guessing may seem bizarre, but they have been shown\\nto provide valuable contributions to the field of predictive maintenance, and their results should not\\nbe ignored.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn order to validate the efficacy of our proposed time-series analysis framework for predictive\\nmaintenance in smart grids, we conducted an exhaustive set of experiments on a comprehensive\\ndataset comprising power consumption patterns from various regions. The dataset was carefully\\ncurated to include diverse seasonal and climatic conditions, thereby ensuring the robustness and\\ngeneralizability of our model. Our experimental setup consisted of a simulated smart grid environment,\\nwhere we mimicked real-world power distribution scenarios using advanced computational tools.\\nWe commenced our experiments by applying a range of time-series analysis techniques, including\\nautocorrelation analysis, spectral analysis, and wavelet analysis, to identify underlying patterns and\\ntrends in the power consumption data. Notably, our autocorrelation analysis revealed a peculiar\\nphenomenon, wherein the power consumption patterns exhibited a strong correlation with the lunar\\n4cycle, particularly during periods of full moon. This unexpected finding prompted us to explore the\\npotential relationship between lunar cycles and power consumption, which led us to incorporate lunar\\nphase data into our predictive model.\\nTo further enhance the accuracy of our model, we employed a novel approach involving the use of\\nfractal geometry to analyze the self-similarity of power consumption patterns at different temporal\\nscales. This unconventional method allowed us to uncover intricate patterns and structures in the data\\nthat would have otherwise remained undetected. Moreover, we discovered that the fractal dimensions\\nof the power consumption time series were inversely proportional to the frequency of maintenance\\noutages, suggesting a previously unknown relationship between the complexity of power consumption\\npatterns and the reliability of the grid.\\nIn addition to these innovative approaches, we also investigated the application of traditional machine\\nlearning algorithms, such as support vector machines and random forests, to predict maintenance\\nneeds based on time-series data.

Ultimately, our research contributes to\\nthe growing body of knowledge in the field of predictive maintenance, providing new insights and\\nperspectives on the application of time-series analysis in smart grids.\\nTo further elucidate the complex relationships between power consumption patterns, lunar cycles,\\nand unicorn airspeed velocity, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the spectral properties of the\\ntime-series data. This involved the application of advanced signal processing techniques, including\\nshort-time Fourier transforms and wavelet packet decomposition, to extract relevant features and\\npatterns from the data. Our analysis revealed a fascinating phenomenon, wherein the spectral\\ncharacteristics of the power consumption time series were found to be intimately related to the\\nharmonic frequencies of the lunar cycle, with a notable peak in spectral power corresponding to the\\nfull moon phase.\\nMoreover, our research also explored the potential applications of chaos theory and complexity\\nscience in the context of predictive maintenance in smart grids. By analyzing the Lyapunov exponents\\nand fractal dimensions of the power consumption time series, we were able to identify early warning\\nsigns of impending maintenance needs, thereby enabling proactive measures to be taken to prevent\\npotential outages and disruptions. This innovative approach has significant implications for the\\ndevelopment of more resilient and reliable smart grid systems, and underscores the importance of\\nconsidering complex, nonlinear dynamics in the analysis of time-series data.\\nIn conclusion, our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed time-series analysis frame-\\nwork for predictive maintenance in smart grids, and highlight the importance of considering un-\\nconventional variables and innovative approaches in the development of more accurate and reliable\\nmaintenance models.

       "  'file_content': 'An Empathetic AI Painter: A System for\\nComputational Creativity Through Embodied\\nConversational Interaction\\nAbstract\\nThis paper presents an investigation into the computational modeling of the creative\\nprocess of a portrait artist, focusing on the incorporation of human traits like per-\\nsonality and emotions into the artistic process. The system includes an empathetic\\nconversational component to discern the dominant personality traits of the user,\\nand this information is then utilized by a generative AI portraiture module to create\\na personalized stylization of the user’s portrait. The paper details the system and\\nthe outcomes of real-time interactions from a demonstration session.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe incorporation of human traits in the creation of artworks has consistently held significant\\nimportance. Although there are differences between art and science regarding their goals and\\ntoolsets, these distinctions blur when artists use scientific understanding to inform their work and\\nscience examines art to comprehend the human experience. The idea of leveraging established\\npsychological insights into human traits such as personality and emotion to guide the creation,\\ncritique, and informing of artwork is not novel. Traditional portrait artists employ their understanding\\nof human perception and vision to create portraits from life or photographs. This process includes the\\narrangement of the environment, placement of the subject, and an interview to grasp their mental\\nand physical characteristics. Artists also aim to convey their individual painting style while trying\\nto express personal and universal ideas. An artist has several options in themes, brush style, color\\nplan, edge and line plan, abstraction style, and emotional narrative to achieve the finished artwork.\\nComputational creativity and generative art offer fresh avenues for modeling scientific knowledge\\nto replicate this process and deepen our grasp of human creativity. This study uses AI techniques\\nto begin emulating this artistic procedure. The Empathic AI Painter system seeks to discover novel\\napproaches to balance diverse aesthetic and conceptual aspects.\\n2 System Description\\nThe Empathic Painter System is created to mimic the interaction between a live portrait artist and\\na person, referred to as the sitter. It aims to understand the sitter’s traits, such as personality and\\nemotions, to create a unique portrait by selecting the appropriate abstraction techniques, color palette,\\nand style that correspond to those traits. The system operates in a two-stage process; the first stage\\ninvolves capturing the characteristics of the sitter, followed by the second stage, which uses the\\ncaptured traits to generate a stylized artistic representation of their portrait. The initial stage of\\ncapturing the personality of the sitter occurs during the conversation with an embodied conversational\\nagent, using empathetic interaction methods. This system utilizes the M-Path conversational agent,\\nwhich has been developed previously. The M-Path system was modified for this demonstration to\\nconduct an interview based on the Big-5 personality questionnaire to categorize the sitter into one\\nof the established personality dimensions. This data is then used to map the personality traits to a\\nparticular artistic style. The mapping is transferred to the Generative AI Portrait Stylization system in\\n.the second stage, which creates an artistic portrait. The interaction process includes several steps.\\nFirst, a portrait of the sitter is captured under controlled lighting conditions, and a unique ID is\\nassigned after consent is provided for participation and use of the portrait. The sitter is then given\\ninformation about the M-Path system with instructions about how to interact. The sitter initiates\\nthe interaction until a complete conversation is concluded and the agent informs the sitter that the\\ninteraction has ended. The M-Path system uses the data collected to classify the sitter’s personality\\ninto a specific dimension. This dimension is then used by the Generative AI Portraiture system\\nto create a personalized portrait style. The generated portraits are showcased on a monitor for all\\nparticipants and the crowd to observe and assess.\\n2.1 Big-5 Personality Mapping\\nThe five-factor model of personality is also known as the \"Big-5 Personality Model\" and is designed\\nas a categorization to capture the variations in personality traits among individuals. This model\\nclassifies personality variations across five dimensions: extraversion, openness, conscientiousness,\\nneuroticism, and agreeableness. Each of these dimensions encompasses a wide range of psychological\\nfunctions, which are composed of more specific traits. Extraversion pertains to the extent to which\\npeople are dominant, talkative, assertive, active, energetic and enthusiastic. Openness characterizes\\npeople who are curious, creative, innovative, imaginative, reflective, cultured, curious, original,\\nbroad-minded, intelligent, and artistically sensitive, seeking new experiences and exploring novel\\nideas. Conscientiousness indicates an individual’s level of hard work, persistence, organization,\\nand motivation in achieving their goals. Individuals high in conscientiousness tend to be organized,\\nplan-oriented, and determined. Neuroticism, also referred to as Emotional Stability, represents\\ndifferences in emotional stability and adjustment. Individuals scoring high on neuroticism tend\\nto experience negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, impulsiveness, self-consciousness,\\nvulnerability, anger, hostility and worry. Agreeableness is linked to likability, conformity, friendliness,\\nand social compliance. Individuals with high scores in agreeableness are characterized as trusting,\\ncaring, forgiving, altruistic, flexible, gullible, good-natured, soft-hearted, cooperative and tolerant.\\nThis model is based on factor analysis of descriptive words of human behavior. The questionnaire\\nused is a shortened version of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory, which has 120 questions\\nand takes 45 minutes to complete. For the online demonstration, one statement for each dimension\\nwas used, where the whole conversational interaction could be completed in under 5 minutes. Each\\nquestion is further modified to align with the conversation setup in the demonstration environment.\\nDimension Question\\nOpenness How do you like the conference so far, is it interesting to you?\\nConscientiousness Don’t you think the conferences are always a bit chaotic?\\nExtraversion Do you normally talk and interact with a lot of people?\\nAgreeableness How about agents? Do you trust me in sharing how you feel?\\nNeuroticism How do you feel about your portrait being displayed on the screen?\\nTable 1: The questions used for the personality dimensions.\\nThe answers to these questions are evaluated for their polarity and then mapped onto two-factor\\ndimensions for personality adjectives. The mapping model is the Abridged Big Five Circumplex\\nModel, in which facets of the Big Five dimensions are mapped as combinations of two factors. The\\nAB5C mapping contains descriptive personality terms for each of the resulting 90 combinations,\\nwhere the most distinctive trait of an individual is used to select the column, and the second most\\ndistinctive trait selects the row. These traits may be either negative or positive. The mapping from\\nBig-5 traits to the Generative AI portrait styles was provided by art experts who independently\\nmapped the styles to the Big-5 categories and reached an agreement.\\n2.2 Empathic Conversational Avatar\\nThe starting point of interaction is the empathetic conversational agent, M-Path, which was developed\\nusing a framework based on a computational model of empathy. M-Path is a human-like avatar\\ncapable of initiating and maintaining an emotional conversation, based on the predetermined goal of\\nthe dialogue. The interaction involves a face-to-face conversation with a human interaction partner,\\n2similar to a video-conference with audio and visual input and output. The agent processes the\\nreal-time inputs in terms of their linguistic and affective properties to generate empathetic verbal\\nand non-verbal behavior. The main objective of the interaction is to complete the modified Big-5\\nquestionnaire to categorize the partner’s personality and send it to the generative art system. The\\nsystem has three distinct modules: a perceptual module, a behavior controller and a behavior manager.\\nThe perceptual module gathers the video and audio signals when the conversation partner is speaking.\\nThis process was triggered with a push-to-talk system. M-Path enters a listening state when the\\nuser speaks. During the listening state, speech and facial expressions are processed in real-time for\\nspeech and emotion recognition. The video input is used in the facial emotion recognition module,\\nwhich uses an OpenCV face-recognition algorithm to identify the face. Emotions are categorized\\nusing a CNN model, trained on the CK+ Dataset, into 6 basic emotion categories. The speech\\ninput is sent to the speech-to-text module which uses a service to get streaming speech recognition.\\nSentiment analysis evaluates the text for its polarity using the SO-CAL Sentiment Analyzer, which\\nwas trained on the NRC-Canada lexicon. The text is sent to the decision-making module for creating\\nconversational responses. This process continues until the partner finishes speaking, which concludes\\nthe listening state. The information is then sent to the decision-making module, and the agent enters a\\nthinking state. The behavior controller module creates goal-directed verbal and non-verbal responses\\nin all states of the conversation: listening, thinking, and speaking. This is done by analyzing the user’s\\nemotional response from the listening state. The conversation begins with the user’s greeting and\\nfinishes when the agent receives suitable answers to the personality survey questions. The listening,\\nthinking, and speaking states of the agent loop until the user is categorized. During the listening\\nstage, the agent shows a non-verbal affect matching response and backchanneling behavior. Affect\\nmatching is a facial expression that mirrors the user’s facial expressions in real-time, chosen by\\nempathy mechanisms. Backchanneling is created by a nodding behavior when pauses are detected\\nin the user’s speech. These behaviors are combined to create an empathic listening behavior. After\\nthe conversation with the participant ends, the final text received and the user’s overall sentiment are\\nsent to the Dialogue Manager (DM), and ultimately to the Empathy Mechanisms (EM). The DM\\ncompletes the Big-5 personality questionnaire to assign a personality category. The EM ensures that\\nthe DM generates empathetic responses while reaching its goal. The DM gathers the appropriate\\nemotional response from the EM to generate an emotionally appropriate verbal reaction to the user,\\nfollowed by a survey-related coping response, and then the next survey question. The system uses the\\nscikit-learn library in Python for the TF-IDF vectorizer model, and the NLTK Lemmatizer. A second\\nmodel is created by fine-tuning BERT for the classification of user responses according to sentiment\\nand the Big-5 questionnaire answers. The Big-5 questionnaire answers are collected to select the\\nmost dominant personality dimensions of the user, based on their probability values and polarity. The\\nBig-5 mapping is used to select a category for the user, with adjectives. This categorization is then\\nsent to the generative art cycle to produce a personalized portrait. After each response is generated\\nby the dialogue manager, it is sent to the behavior manager to be performed by the conversational\\nagent during the speaking state. To achieve a natural conversation, the system continuously produces\\nnon-verbal and verbal behaviors. Lip movements, facial expressions, head gestures, body gestures,\\nand posture are synchronized with the agent’s speech. The animation is sent as a BML message to\\nthe Smartbody character animation platform, to display the generated behaviors.\\n2.3 Generative AI Portraiture System\\nThe stylistic rendering of the portraits is generated by the generative art component of the system.\\nThe portrait goes through three processing phases. The first phase preprocesses the original portrait\\nby using an AI tool to separate the foreground from the background, which will be used to stylize\\nthe portrait. Then, the light and color balance of the face are adjusted to achieve a lighting effect,\\nwhere one side of the face is dramatically shown. The next phase uses this image and the personality\\ncategory as inputs to a modified Deep Dream (mDD) system with multiple passes on the image to\\ncreate the base style. While most DD systems use pre-trained networks with object recognition data,\\nthe modified system uses artistic paintings and drawings as training data. The system has a dataset of\\n160,000 labeled and categorized paintings from 3000 artists. A method called hierarchical tight style\\nand tile was developed to overcome the problem that most artists create fewer than 200 paintings\\nin their lifetimes. In the last phase, the source image from the previous phase is further enhanced\\nusing the personality category. The ePainterly system combines Deep Style techniques as a surface\\ntexture manipulator, and a series of Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) techniques like particle\\nsystems, color palette manipulation, and stroke engine techniques. This iterative process enhances\\n3the portrait, and the final result is shown in an online gallery. The ePainterly module is an expansion\\nof the Painterly painting system, which models the cognitive processes of artists based on years of\\nresearch. The NPR subclass of stroke-based rendering is used as the final part of the process to realize\\nthe internal mDD models with stroke-based output. This additional step reduces noise artifacts from\\nthe mDD output, creates cohesive stroke-based clustering, and a better distributed color space.\\n3 Conclusion\\nThe Empathic AI Painter was presented at a conference demonstration session. Forty-two participants\\ntested the system, with 26 of them completing the portrait-taking and interaction. Each conversation\\nwith the M-Path system took approximately 5 minutes. The performance of the M-Path system was\\nevaluated individually. On average, 84.72\\n4'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Graph Neural Networks Without Training: Harnessing the Power of\\nLabels as Input Features\\nAbstract\\nThis study introduces a novel concept of training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs) for transductive node\\nclassification, which can function immediately without any training and can optionally be enhanced through\\nsubsequent training. Initially, we put forward the idea of using labels as features (LaF), a valid yet relatively\\nunexplored method in graph neural networks. Our analysis demonstrates that incorporating labels as features\\nsignificantly improves the representational capacity of GNNs. The design of TFGNNs is based on these findings.\\nEmpirical evaluations show that TFGNNs surpass current GNNs in scenarios where training is not performed, and\\nwhen training is optionally applied, they achieve convergence much faster than conventional GNNs.\\n1 Introduction\\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence as effective models for handling graph-structured data. They have\\ndemonstrated impressive performance across a range of tasks, including chemical structure analysis, question answering systems,\\nand recommender systems.\\nA common application for GNNs is transductive node classification. In this task, the objective is to infer the labels of specific nodes\\nwithin a graph, given the labels of other nodes. This approach finds utility in various real-world scenarios, such as classifying\\ndocuments, analyzing e-commerce data, and studying social networks. Several GNN architectures, including Graph Convolutional\\nNetworks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), have successfully addressed transductive node classification, yielding\\nexcellent results.\\nA significant hurdle in the practical application of GNNs is their computational demand. Real-world graphs, such as those\\nrepresenting social networks or the structure of the web, can be enormous, containing billions of nodes. Processing these massive\\ngraphs can be computationally prohibitive. While various methods have been developed to enhance the efficiency of GNNs, such as\\nnode and edge sampling techniques, these methods still necessitate numerous training iterations. Other approaches, like PinSAGE,\\nutilize parallel training and importance pooling to accelerate the training process, but they demand substantial computational\\nresources. Consequently, the immediate deployment of GNNs with limited resources remains a challenge.\\nIn this work, we introduce the concept of training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs). To realize TFGNNs, we first propose the\\ninnovative idea of using labels as features (LaF). In the context of transductive node classification, utilizing node labels as features is\\na permissible approach. GNNs employing LaF can leverage label information, like the distribution of classes among neighboring\\nnodes, to generate node embeddings. These embeddings are richer in information compared to those derived solely from node\\nfeatures. We establish that incorporating labels as features demonstrably augments the expressive capability of GNNs.\\nTFGNNs possess the unique ability to operate without any training, enabling immediate deployment upon initialization. This\\neliminates the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning when used in training-free mode. Furthermore, TFGNNs can be refined\\nthrough optional training. Users have the flexibility to employ TFGNNs without training or to train them for a limited number of\\niterations when computational resources are constrained. This adaptability is particularly valuable in online learning scenarios,\\nwhere data arrives sequentially, and the model needs to be updated promptly. TFGNNs can also undergo full training when resources\\nare plentiful or when higher accuracy is paramount. In essence, TFGNNs offer the advantages of both nonparametric models and\\ntraditional GNNs.\\nOur experiments confirm that TFGNNs surpass existing GNNs when used without training and achieve convergence significantly\\nfaster than traditional GNNs when training is applied.\\nThe primary contributions of this research are outlined below:\\n* We propose the utilization of labels as features (LaF) in transductive learning settings. * We provide formal proof that LaF enhances\\nthe representational power of GNNs. * We introduce a novel architecture for training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs). * We\\nempirically demonstrate that TFGNNs outperform existing GNNs in the absence of training.2 Background\\n2.1 Notations\\nFor any positive integer n, [n] represents the set {1, 2, ..., n}. A graph is represented by a tuple comprising (i) a set of nodes V , (ii) a\\nset of edges E, and (iii) node features X = [x1, x2, ..., xn]T ∈ Rn×d. We assume nodes are numbered from 1 to n. Y denotes the\\nset of possible labels. yv ∈ R|Y | is the one-hot encoded label for node v. N(v) represents the set of neighboring nodes of node\\nv. We use numpy-like indexing notation. For instance, X:,1 denotes the first column of X, X:,−1 denotes the last column, X:,−5:\\ndenotes the last five columns, and X:,:−5 denotes all columns except the last five.\\n2.2 Transductive Node Classification\\n**Problem (Transductive Node Classification).** **Input:** A graph G = (V, E, X), a set of labeled nodes Vtrain ⊂ V , and\\nthe corresponding labels Ytrain ∈ Y Vtrain for these nodes. **Output:** Predicted labels Ytest ∈ Y Vtest for the remaining nodes\\nVtest = V \\\\ Vtrain.\\nThe node classification problem has two distinct settings: transductive and inductive. In the transductive setting, a single graph\\nis provided along with the labels for a subset of its nodes, and the task is to predict the labels for the unlabeled nodes within the\\nsame graph. This contrasts with the inductive setting, where separate graphs are used for training and testing. For example, in the\\ncontext of spam detection, if we label spam accounts on a social network like Facebook and then use a trained model to identify\\nspam accounts on the same network, this is a transductive scenario. Conversely, if we use the model trained on Facebook data to\\nidentify spam accounts on a different platform like Twitter, this is an inductive scenario.\\nTransductive node classification is a widely studied problem in the GNN community. It has been employed in well-known GNN\\nmodels like GCNs and GATs and is used in popular benchmark datasets such as Cora, PubMed, and CiteSeer. This setting also has\\nnumerous practical applications, including document classification and fraud detection.\\n2.3 Graph Neural Networks\\nGNNs are a prevalent method for solving transductive node classification problems. We adopt the message-passing framework for\\nGNNs. A message-passing GNN can be defined as follows:\\nh(0)\\nv = xv (∀v ∈ V ),\\nh(l)\\nv = f(l)\\nagg(h(l−1)\\nv , {h(l−1)\\nu |u ∈ N(v)}) (∀l ∈ [L], v∈ V ),\\nˆyv = fpred(h(L)\\nv ) (∀v ∈ V ),\\nwhere f(l)\\nagg is the aggregation function at layer l, and fpred is the prediction head, typically implemented using neural networks.\\n3 LaF is Admissible, but Not Explored Well\\nWe remind the reader of the transductive node classification problem setup. We are given the node labels yv of the training nodes. A\\nstandard approach is to input the node features xv of a training node v into the model, predict its label, calculate the loss based on\\nthe true label yv, and update the model parameters. However, the use of yv is not restricted to this. We can also incorporate yv as a\\nfeature for node v. This is the core concept behind LaF.\\nGNNs with LaF initialize node embeddings as:\\nh(0)\\nv = [xv; ˜yv] ∈ Rd+1+|Y |,\\nwhere [·; ·] denotes vector concatenation, and\\n˜yv = {[ 1;yv](v ∈ Vtrain)\\n01+|Y |(v ∈ Vtest),\\nis the label vector for node v, and 0d is a zero vector of dimension d. LaF allows GNNs to utilize label information, such as the class\\ndistribution in neighboring nodes, to compute node embeddings. These embeddings are likely to be more informative than those\\nwithout label information. LaF is considered admissible because it only uses information available in the transductive setting.\\nWe emphasize that LaF has not been thoroughly investigated in the GNN literature, despite its simplicity, with a few exceptions.\\nFor instance, GCNs and GATs use the transductive setting and could potentially use label information as features. However, they\\ninitialize node embeddings as h(0)\\nv = xv without using label information. One of the contributions of this paper is to highlight that\\nLaF is permissible in the transductive setting.\\n2Care must be taken when training GNNs with LaF. LaF might negatively impact generalization by creating a shortcut where the\\nmodel simply copies the label feature h(0)\\nv,d+1: to the prediction. To avoid this, we should remove the labels of the center nodes in the\\nminibatch and treat them as test nodes. Specifically, if B ⊂ Vtrain is the set of nodes in the minibatch, we set\\n˜yv = {[ 1;yv](v ∈ Vtrain \\\\ B)\\n01+|Y |(v ∈ Vtest ∪ B),\\nand predict the label ˆyv for v ∈ B, calculating the loss based on ˆyv and yv. This simulates the transductive setting where the label\\ninformation of test nodes is unavailable, and GNNs learn to predict test node labels based on the label information and node features\\nof surrounding nodes.\\n4 LaF Strengthens the Expressive Power of GNNs\\nWe demonstrate that incorporating labels as features (LaF) provably enhances the expressive capabilities of Graph Neural Networks\\n(GNNs). Specifically, we show that GNNs utilizing LaF can effectively represent the label propagation algorithm, a crucial method\\nfor transductive node classification, whereas GNNs without LaF cannot achieve this. This finding is significant in its own right and\\nprovides a strong motivation for the design of TFGNNs.\\nLabel propagation is a well-established method for transductive node classification. It operates by initiating random walks from a\\ntest node and generating the label distribution of the labeled nodes that these random walks encounter first. The following theorem\\nestablishes that GNNs with LaF can effectively approximate label propagation.\\n**Theorem 4.1.** GNNs with LaF can approximate label propagation with arbitrary precision. Specifically, there exists a series of\\nGNNs {f(l)\\nagg}l and fpred such that for any positiveϵ, for any connected graph G = (V, E, X), for any labeled nodes Vtrain ⊂ V and\\nnode labels Ytrain ∈ Y Vtrain , and test node v ∈ V \\\\Vtrain, there exists L ∈ Z+ such that the l(≥ L)-th GNN (f(1)\\nagg, ..., f(l)\\nagg, fpred)\\nwith LaF outputs an approximation of label propagation with an error of at most ϵ, i.e.,\\n||ˆyv − ˆyLP\\nv ||1 < ϵ,\\nwhere ˆyLP\\nv is the output of label propagation for test node v.\\n**Proof.** We prove the theorem by construction. Let\\npl,v,idef= Pr[The random walk from node v hits Vtrain within l steps and the first hit label is i].\\nFor labeled nodes, this is a constant:\\npl,v,i = 1[i=yv] (∀l ∈ Z≥0, v∈ Vtrain, i∈ Y ).\\nFor other nodes, it can be recursively computed as:\\np0,v,i = 0 (∀v ∈ V \\\\ Vtrain, i∈ Y ),\\npl,v,i = P\\nu∈N(v)\\n1\\ndeg(v) · pl−1,u,i.\\nThese equations can be represented by GNNs with LaF. The base case\\np0,v,i = {1[i=yv] (v ∈ Vtrain)\\n0(v ∈ V \\\\ Vtrain),\\ncan be computed from ˜yv in h(0)\\nv . Let f(l)\\nagg always concatenate its first argument (h(l−1)\\nv ) to the output so the GNN retains input\\ninformation. f(l)\\nagg handles two cases based on ˜yv,1 ∈ {0, 1}, indicating whether v is in Vtrain. If v ∈ Vtrain, f(l)\\nagg outputs 1[i=yv],\\ncomputable from ˜yv in h(l−1)\\nv . If v /∈ Vtrain, f(l)\\nagg aggregates pl−1,u,i from u ∈ N(v) and averages them, as in the recursive\\nequation, realizable by message passing in the second argument of f(l)\\nagg.\\nThe final output of the GNN is pl,v,i. The output of label propagation can be decomposed as:\\nˆyLP\\nv,i = Pr[The first hit label is i]\\n= pl,v,i+ Pr[The random walk from node v does not hit Vtrain within l steps and the first hit label is i].\\nAs the second term converges to zero as l increases, GNNs can approximate label propagation with arbitrary precision by increasing\\nl.\\nWe then show that GNNs without LaF cannot represent label propagation.\\n**Proposition 4.2.** GNNs without LaF cannot approximate label propagation. Specifically, for any series of GNNs {f(l)\\nagg}l and\\nfpred, there exists a positive ϵ, a connected graph G = (V, E, X), labeled nodes Vtrain ⊂ V , node labels Ytrain ∈ Y Vtrain , and a\\ntest node v ∈ V \\\\ Vtrain, such that for any l, the GNN (f(1)\\nagg, ..., f(l)\\nagg, fpred) without LaF has an error of at least ϵ, i.e.,\\n3||ˆyv − ˆyLP\\nv ||1 > ϵ,\\nwhere ˆyLP\\nv is the output of label propagation for test node v.\\n**Proof.** We construct a counterexample. Let G be a cycle of four nodes numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 clockwise. All nodes have the same\\nfeature x. Let Vtrain = {1, 2} and Ytrain = [1, 0]T . Label propagation classifies node 4 as class 1 and node 3 as class 0. However,\\nGNNs without LaF always predict the same label for nodes 3 and 4 since they are isomorphic. Thus, for any GNN without LaF,\\nthere is an irreducible error for either node 3 or 4.\\nTheorem 4.1 and Proposition 4.2 demonstrate that LaF provably enhances the expressive power of GNNs. These results indicate that\\nGNNs with LaF are more powerful than traditional message-passing GNNs like GCNs, GATs, and GINs without LaF. Notably, while\\nGINs are considered the most expressive message-passing GNNs, they cannot represent label propagation without LaF, whereas\\nmessage-passing GNNs with LaF can. This does not lead to a contradiction since the original GINs do not take the label information\\nas input. In other words, the input domains of the functions differ. These findings highlight the importance of considering both the\\ninput and the architecture of GNNs to maximize their expressive power.\\n5 Training-free Graph Neural Networks\\nWe propose training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs) based on the analysis in the previous section. TFGNNs can be used\\nwithout training and can also be improved with optional training.\\nFirst, we define training-free models.\\n**Definition 5.1 (Training-free Model).** We say a parametric model is training-free if it can be used without optimizing the\\nparameters.\\nIt should be noted that nonparametric models are training-free by definition. The real worth of TFGNNs is that it is training-free\\nwhile it can be improved with optional training. Users can enjoy the best of both worlds of parametric and nonparametric models by\\nchoosing the trade-off based on the computational resources for training and the accuracy required.\\nThe core idea of TFGNNs is to embed label propagation in GNNs by Theorem 4.1. TFGNNs are defined as follows:\\nh(0)\\nv = [xv; ˜yv],\\nh(l)\\nv = { ReLU(S(l)h(l−1)\\nv + 1\\n|N(v)|\\nP\\nu∈N(v) W(l)h(l−1)\\nu )(v ∈ Vtrain, l∈ [L])\\nReLU(T(l)h(l−1)\\nv + 1\\n|N(v)|\\nP\\nu∈N(v) W(l)h(l−1)\\nu )(v ∈ Vtest, l∈ [L]),\\nˆyv = softmax(Uh(L)\\nv ),\\nThe architecture of TFGNNs is standard, i.e., TFGNNs transform the center nodes and carry out mean aggregation from the\\nneighboring nodes. The key to TFGNNs lies in initialization. The parameters are initialized as follows:\\nS(l)\\n−(1+|Y |):,:−(1+|Y |) = 0 , S(l)\\n−(1+|Y |):,−(1+|Y |): = I1+|Y |, V (l)\\n−(1+|Y |): = 0 , T(l)\\n−(1+|Y |): = 0 , W(l)\\n−(1+|Y |):,:−(1+|Y |) = 0 ,\\nW(l)\\n−(1+|Y |):,−(1+|Y |): = I1+|Y |, U:,:−|Y | = 0, U:,−|Y |: = I|Y |,\\ni.e., the parameters of the last (1 +|Y |) rows or |Y | rows are initialized by 0 or 1 in a special pattern (Figure 1). Other parameters\\nare initialized randomly, e.g., by Xavier initialization. The following proposition shows that the initialized TFGNNs approximate\\nlabel propagation.\\n**Proposition 5.2.** The initialized TFGNNs approximate label propagation. Specifically,\\nh(L)\\nv,−(|Y |−i+1) = pL,v,i\\nholds, where pL,v,i is defined in Eq. (8), and\\nargmaxiˆyv,i = argmaxipL,v,i\\nholds, and pL,v,i → ˆyLP\\nv,i as L → ∞.\\n**Proof.** By the definitions of TFGNNs,\\nh(0)\\nv,−|Y |: = {y v (v ∈ Vtrain)\\n0|Y |(v ∈ Vtest),\\nh(l)\\nv,−|Y |: = {h\\n(l−1)\\nv,−|Y |: (v ∈ Vtrain, l∈ [L])\\n1\\n|N(v)|\\nP\\nu∈N(v) h(l−1)\\nu,−|Y |:(v ∈ Vtest, l∈ [L]).\\nThis recursion is the same as Eqs. (9) – (13). Therefore,\\n4h(L)\\nv,−(|Y |−i+1) = pL,v,i\\nholds. As U picks the last |Y | dimensions, and softmax is monotone,\\nargmaxiˆyv,i = argmaxipL,v,i\\nholds. pL,v,i → ˆyLP\\nv,i as L → ∞is shown in the proof of Theorem 4.1.\\nTherefore, the initialized TFGNNs can be used for transductive node classification as are without training. The approximation\\nalgorithm of label propagation is seamlessly embedded in the model parameters, and TFGNNs can also be trained as usual GNNs.\\n6 Experiments\\n6.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe use the Planetoid datasets (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed), Coauthor datasets, and Amazon datasets in the experiments. We use 20\\nnodes per class for training, 500 nodes for validation, and the rest for testing in the Planetoid datasets following standard practice,\\nand use 20 nodes per class for training, 30 nodes per class for validation, and the rest for testing in the Coauthor and Amazon\\ndatasets. We use GCNs and GATs for the baselines. We use three-layered models with a hidden dimension of 32 unless otherwise\\nspecified. We train all models with AdamW with a learning rate of 0.0001 and weight decay of 0.01.\\n6.2 TFGNNs Outperform Existing GNNs in Training-free Setting\\nWe compare the performance of TFGNNs with GCNs and GATs in the training-free setting by assessing the accuracy of the models\\nwhen the parameters are initialized. The results are shown in Table 1. TFGNNs outperform GCNs and GATs in all the datasets.\\nSpecifically, both GCNs and GATs are almost random in the training-free setting, while TFGNNs achieve non-trivial accuracy. These\\nresults validate that TFGNNs meet the definition of training-free models. We can also observe that GCNs, GATs, and TFGNNs do\\nnot benefit from LaF in the training-free settings if randomly initialized. These results indicate that both LaF and the initialization of\\nTFGNNs are important for training-free performance.\\nTable 1: Node classification accuracy in the training-free setting. The best results are shown in bold. CS: Coauthor CS, Physics:\\nCoauthor Physics, Computers: Amazon Computers, Photo: Amazon Photo. TFGNNs outperform GCNs and GATs in all the datasets.\\nThese results indicate that TFGNNs are training-free. Note that we use three-layered TFGNNs to make the comparison fair although\\ndeeper TFGNNs perform better in the training-free setting as we confirm in Section 6.3.\\nCora CiteSeer PubMed CS Physics Computers\\nGCNs 0.163 0.167 0.180 0.079 0.101 0.023\\nGCNs + LaF 0.119 0.159 0.407 0.080 0.146 0.061\\nGATs 0.177 0.229 0.180 0.040 0.163 0.058\\nGATs + LaF 0.319 0.077 0.180 0.076 0.079 0.025\\nTFGNNs + random initialization 0.149 0.177 0.180 0.023 0.166 0.158\\nTFGNNs (proposed) 0.600 0.362 0.413 0.601 0.717 0.730\\n6.3 Deep TFGNNs Perform Better in Training-free Setting\\nWe confirm that deeper TFGNNs perform better in the training-free setting. We have used three-layered TFGNNs so far to make\\nthe comparison fair with existing GNNs. Proposition 5.2 shows that the initialized TFGNNs converge to label propagation as the\\ndepth goes to infinity, and we expect that deeper TFGNNs perform better in the training-free setting. Figure 2 shows the accuracy of\\nTFGNNs with different depths for the Cora dataset. We can observe that deeper TFGNNs perform better in the training-free setting\\nuntil the depth reaches around 10, where the performance saturates. It is noteworthy that GNNs have been known to suffer from the\\noversmoothing problem, and the performance of GNNs degrades as the depth increases. It is interesting that TFGNNs do not suffer\\nfrom the oversmoothing problem in the training-free setting. It should be noted that it does not necessarily mean that deeper models\\nperform better in the optional training mode because the optional training may break the structure introduced by the initialization of\\nTFGNNs and may lead to oversmoothing and/or overfitting. We leave it as a future work to overcome these problems by adopting\\ncountermeasures such as initial residual and identity mapping, MADReg, and DropEdge.\\n6.4 TFGNNs Converge Fast\\nIn the following, we investigate the optional training mode of TFGNNs. We train the models with three random seeds and report the\\naverage accuracy and standard deviation. We use baseline GCNs without LaF (i.e., the original GCNs) as the baseline.\\nFirst, we confirm that TFGNNs in the optional training mode converge faster than GCNs. We show the training curves of TFGNNs\\nand GCNs for the Cora dataset in Figure 3. TFGNNs converge much faster than GCNs. We hypothesize that TFGNNs converge\\n5faster because the initialized TFGNNs are in a good starting point, while GCNs start from a completely random point and require\\nmany iterations to reach a good point. We can also observe that fully trained TFGNNs perform on par with GCNs. These results\\nindicate that TFGNNs enjoy the best of both worlds: TFGNNs perform well without training and can be trained faster with optional\\ntraining.\\n6.5 TFGNNs are Robust to Feature Noise\\nAs TFGNNs use both node features and label information while traditional GNNs rely only on node features, we expect that\\nTFGNNs are more robust to feature noise than traditional GNNs. We confirm this in this section. We add i.i.d. Gaussian noise with\\nstandard deviation σ to the node features and evaluate the accuracy of the models. We train TFGNNs and GCNs with the Cora\\ndataset. The results are shown in Figure 4. TFGNNs are more robust to feature noise especially in high noise regimes where the\\nperformance of GCNs degrades significantly. These results indicate that TFGNNs are more robust to i.i.d. Gaussian noise to the\\nnode features than traditional GNNs.\\n7 Related Work\\n7.1 Labels as Features and Training-free GNNs\\nThe most relevant work is by Wang et al., who proposed to use node labels in GNNs. This technique was also used by Addanki et al.\\nand analyzed by Wang et al. The underlying idea is common with LaF, i.e., use of label information as input to transductive GNNs.\\nA similar result as Theorem 4.1 was also shown in Wang et al. However, the focus is different, and there are different points between\\nthis work and theirs. We propose the training-free + optional training framework for the first time. The notable characteristics of\\nGNNs are (i) TFGNNs receive both original features and LaF, (ii) TFGNNs can be deployed without training, and (iii) TFGNNs can\\nbe improved with optional training. Besides, we provide detailed analysis and experiments including the speed of convergence and\\nnoise robustness. Our results provide complementary insights to the existing works.\\nAnother related topic is graph echo state networks, which lead to lightweight models for graph data. The key idea is to use randomly\\ninitialized fixed weights for aggregation. The main difference is that graph echo state networks still require to train the output layer,\\nwhile TFGNNs can be used without training. These methods are orthogonal, and it is an interesting direction to combine them to\\nfurther improve the performance.\\n7.2 Speeding up GNNs\\nVarious methods have been proposed to speed up GNNs to handle large graph data. GraphSAGE is one of the earliest methods to\\nspeed up GNNs. GraphSAGE employs neighbor sampling to reduce the computational cost of training and inference. It samples a\\nfixed number of neighbors for each node and aggregates the features of the sampled neighbors. An alternative sampling method is\\nlayer-wise sampling introduced in FastGCN. Huang et al. further improved FastGCN by using an adaptive node sampling technique\\nto reduce the variance of estimators. LADIES combined neighbor sampling and layer-wise sampling to take the best of both worlds.\\nAnother approach is to use smaller training graphs. ClusterGCN uses a cluster of nodes as a mini-batch. GraphSAINT samples\\nsubgraphs by random walks for each mini-batch.\\nIt should also be noted that general techniques to speed up neural networks, such as mixed-precision training, quantization, and\\npruning can be applied to GNNs.\\nThese methods mitigate the training cost of GNNs, but they still require many training iterations. In this paper, we propose\\ntraining-free GNNs, which can be deployed instantly as soon as the model is initialized. Besides, our method can be improved with\\noptional training. In the optional training mode, the speed up techniques mentioned above can be combined with our method to\\nreduce the training time further.\\n7.3 Expressive Power of GNNs\\nExpressive power (or representation power) means what kind of functional classes a model family can realize. The expressive power\\nof GNNs is an important field of research in its own right. If GNNs cannot represent the true function, we cannot expect GNNs to\\nwork well however we train them. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the expressive power of GNNs. Originally, Morris et al. and\\nXu et al. showed that message-passing GNNs are at most as powerful as the 1-WL test, and they proposed k-GNNs and GINs, which\\nare as powerful as the k-(set)WL and 1-WL tests, respectively. GINs are the most powerful message-passing GNNs. Sato and Loukas\\nshowed that message-passing GNNs are as powerful as a computational model of distributed local algorithms, and they proposed\\nGNNs that are as powerful as port-numbering and randomized local algorithms. Loukas showed that GNNs are Turing-complete\\nunder certain conditions (i.e., with unique node ids and infinitely increasing depths). Some other works showed that GNNs can\\nsolve or cannot solve some specific problems, e.g., GNNs can recover the underlying geometry, GNNs cannot recognize bridges and\\narticulation points. There are various efforts to improve the expressive power of GNNs by non-message-passing architectures. We\\nrefer the readers to survey papers for more details on the expressive power of GNNs.\\n6We contributed to the field of the expressive power of GNNs by showing that GNNs with LaF are more powerful than GNNs without\\nLaF. Specifically, we showed that GNNs with LaF can represent an important model, label propagation, while GNNs without LaF\\ncannot. It should be emphasized that GINs, the most powerful message-passing GNNs, and Turing-complete GNNs cannot represent\\nlabel propagation without LaF because they do not have access to the label information label propagation uses, and also noted that\\nGINs traditionally do not use LaF. This result indicates that it is important to consider what to input to the GNNs as well as the\\narchitecture of the GNNs for the expressive power of GNNs. This result provides a new insight into the field of the expressive power\\nof GNNs.\\n8 Limitations\\nOur work has several limitations. First, LaF and TFGNNs cannot be applied to inductive settings while most GNNs can. We do not\\nregard this as a negative point. Popular GNNs such as GCNs and GATs are applicable to both transductive and inductive settings and\\nare often used for transductive settings. However, this also means that they do not take advantage of transductive-specific structures\\n(those that are not present in inductive settings). We believe that it is important to exploit inductive-specific techniques for inductive\\nsettings and transductive-specific techniques (such as LaF) for transductive settings in order to pursue maximum performance.\\nSecond, TFGNNs cannot be applied to heterophilious graphs, or its performance degrades as TFGNNs are based on label propagation.\\nThe same argument mentioned above applies. Relying on homophilious graphs is not a negative point in pursuing maximum\\nperformance. It should be noted that LaF may also be exploited in heterophilious settings as well. Developing training-free GNNs\\nfor heterophilious graphs based on LaF is an interesting future work.\\nThird, we did not aim to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Exploring the combination of LaF with fancy techniques to\\nachieve state-of-the-art performance is left as future work.\\nFinally, we did not explore applications of LaF other than TFGNNs. LaF can help other GNNs in non-training-free settings as well.\\nExploring the application of LaF to other GNNs is left as future work.\\n9 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we made the following contributions.\\n* We advocated the use of LaF in transductive learning (Section 3). * We confirmed that LaF is admissible in transductive learning,\\nbut LaF has not been explored in the field of GNNs such as GCNs and GATs. * We formally showed that LaF strengthens the\\nexpressive power of GNNs (Section 4). * We showed that GNNs with LaF can represent label propagation (Theorem 4.1) while\\nGNNs without LaF cannot (Proposition 4.2). * We proposed training-free graph neural networks, TFGNNs (Section 5). * We\\nshowed that TFGNNs defined by Eqs.

See details in Section 6.\\n1 Introduction\\nCars represent a revolution in mobility and convenience, bringing us the flexibility of moving from\\nplace to place. The societal benefits (and cost) are far-reaching. Cars are now indispensable from our\\nmodern life as a vehicle for transportation. In many places, the car is also viewed as a tool to help\\nproject someone’s economic status, or reflects our economic stratification. In addition, the car has\\nevolved into a subject of interest amongst many car enthusiasts in the world. In general, the demand\\non car has shifted over the years to cover not only practicality and reliability, but also high comfort\\nand design. The enormous number of car designs and car model makes car a rich object class, which\\ncan potentially foster more sophisticated and robust computer vision models and algorithms.\\nCars present several unique properties that other objects cannot offer, which provides more challenges\\nand facilitates a range of novel research topics in object categorization. Specifically, cars own large\\nquantity of models that most other categories do not have, enabling a more challenging fine-grained\\ntask. In addition, cars yield large appearance differences in their unconstrained poses, which demands\\nviewpoint-aware analyses and algorithms (see Fig. 1(b)). Importantly, a unique hierarchy is presented\\nfor the car category, which is three levels from top to bottom: make, model, and released year.\\nThis structure indicates a direction to address the fine-grained task in a hierarchical way, which is\\nonly discussed by limited literature. Apart from the categorization task, cars reveal a number of\\ninteresting computer vision problems. Firstly, different designing styles are applied by different\\ncar manufacturers and in different years, which opens the door to fine-grained style analysis and\\n.fine-grained part recognition (see Fig. 1(c)). Secondly, the car is an attractive topic for attribute\\nprediction. In particular, cars have distinctive attributes such as car class, seating capacity, number\\nof axles, maximum speed and displacement, which can be inferred from the appearance of the cars\\n(see Fig. 1(a)). Lastly, in comparison to human face verification, car verification, which targets at\\nverifying whether two cars belong to the same model, is an interesting and under- researched problem.\\nThe unconstrained viewpoints make car verification arguably more challenging than traditional face\\nverification.\\nAutomated car model analysis, particularly the fine- grained car categorization and verification, can be\\nused for innumerable purposes in intelligent transportation sys- tem including regulation, description\\nand indexing. For instance, fine-grained car categorization can be exploited to inexpensively automate\\nand expedite paying tolls from the lanes, based on different rates for different types of vehicles.\\nIn video surveillance applications, car verification from appearance helps tracking a car over a\\nmultiple camera network when car plate recognition fails. In post-event in- vestigation, similar\\ncars can be retrieved from the database with car verification algorithms. Car model analysis also\\nbears significant value in the personal car consumption. When people are planning to buy cars, they\\ntend to observe cars in the street. Think of a mobile application, which can instantly show a user\\nthe detailed information of a car once a car photo is taken. Such an application will provide great\\nconvenience when people want to know the information of an unrecognized car. Other applications\\nsuch as predicting popularity based on the appearance of a car, and recommending cars with similar\\nstyles can be beneficial both for manufacturers and consumers.\\nDespite the huge research and practical interests, car model analysis only attracts few attentions\\nin the computer vision community. We believe the lack of high quality datasets greatly limits the\\nexploration of the community in this domain. To this end, we collect and organize a large-scale\\nand comprehensive image database called “Comprehensive Cars”, with “CompCars” being short.\\nThe “CompCars” dataset is much larger in scale and diversity compared with the current car image\\ndatasets, containing 208, 826 images of 1, 716 car models from two scenarios: web-nature and\\nsurveillance-nature. In addition, the dataset is carefully labelled with viewpoints and car parts, as well\\nas rich attributes such as type of car, seat capacity, and door number. The new dataset dataset thus\\nprovides a comprehensive platform to validate the effectiveness of a wide range of computer vision\\nalgorithms. It is also ready to be utilized for realistic applications and enormous novel research topics.\\nMoreover, the multi-scenario nature en- ables the use of the dataset for cross modality research. The\\ndetailed description of CompCars is provided in Section 3.\\nTo validate the usefulness of the dataset and to encourage the community to explore for more novel\\nresearch topics, we demonstrate several interesting applications with the dataset, including car model\\nclassification and verification based on convolutional neural network (CNN). An- other interesting\\ntask is to predict attributes from novel car models (see details in Section 4.2). The experiments reveal\\nseveral challenges specific to the car-related problems. We conclude our analyses with a discussion\\nin Section 7.\\n2 Related Work\\nMost previous car model research focuses on car model classification. propose an evolutionary\\ncomputing framework to fit a wireframe model to the car on an image. Then the wireframe model is\\nemployed for car model recognition. construct 3D space curves using 2D training images, then match\\nthe 3D curves to 2D image curves using a 3D view-based alignment technique. The car model is\\nfinally determined with the alignment result. optimize 3D model fitting and fine-grained classification\\njointly. All these works are restricted to a small number of car models. Recently, propose to extract\\n3D car representation for classifying 196 car models. The experiment is the largest scale that we\\nare aware of. Car model classification is a fine-grained categorization task. In contrast to general\\nobject classification, fine-grained categorization targets at recognizing the subcategories in one object\\nclass. Fol- lowing this line of research, many studies have proposed different datasets on a variety\\nof categories: birds, dogs, cars, flowers, etc. But all these datasets are limited by their scales and\\nsubcategory numbers.\\nTo our knowledge, there is no previous attempt on the car model verification task. Closely related to\\ncar model verification, face verification has been a popular topic. The recent deep learning based\\nalgorithms first train a deep neural network on human identity clas- sification, then train a verification\\n2model with the feature extracted from the deep neural network. Joint Bayesian is a widely-used\\nverification model that models two faces jointly with an appropriate prior on the face representation.\\nWe adopt Joint Bayesian as a baseline model in car model verification.\\nAttribute prediction of humans is a popular research topic in recent years. However, a large portion\\nof the labeled attributes in the current attribute datasets, such as long hair and short pants lack strict\\ncriteria, which causes annotation ambiguities. The attributes with ambiguities will potentially harm\\nthe effectiveness of evaluation on related datasets. In contrast, the attributes provided by CompCars\\n(e.g. maximum speed, door number, seat capacity) all have strict criteria since they are set by the car\\nmanufacturers. The dataset is thus advantageous over the current datasets in terms of the attributes\\nvalidity.\\nOther car-related research includes detection, track- ing, joint detection and pose estimation, and 3D\\nparsing. Fine-grained car models are not explored in these studies. Previous research related to car\\nparts includes car logo recognition and car style analysis based on mid-level features.\\nSimilar to CompCars, the Cars dataset also targets at fine-grained tasks on the car category. Apart\\nfrom the larger-scale database, our CompCars dataset offers several significant benefits in comparison\\nto the Cars dataset. First, our dataset contains car images diversely distributed in all viewpoints\\n(annotated by front, rear, side, front-side, and rear-side), while Cars dataset mostly consists of front-\\nside car images. Second, our dataset contains aligned car part images, which can be utilized for many\\ncomputer vision algorithms that demand precise alignment. Third, our dataset provides rich attribute\\nannotations for each car model, which are absent in the Cars dataset.\\n3 Properties of CompCars\\nThe CompCars dataset contains data from two scenarios, including images from web-nature and\\nsurveillance-nature. The images of the web-nature are collected from car forums, public websites,\\nand search engines. The images of the surveillance-nature are collected by surveillance cameras. The\\ndata of these two scenarios are widely used in the real-world applications. They open the door for\\ncross-modality analysis of cars. In particular, the web-nature data contains 163 car makes with 1, 716\\ncar models, covering most of the commercial car models in the recent ten years. There are a total of\\n136, 727 images capturing the entire cars and 27, 618 images capturing the car parts, where most\\nof them are labeled with attributes and viewpoints. The surveillance-nature data contains 44, 481\\ncar images captured in the front view. Each image in the surveillance-nature partition is annotated\\nwith bounding box, model, and color of the car. Fig. 2 illustrates some examples of surveillance\\nimages, which are affected by large variations from lightings and haze. Note that the data from the\\nsurveillance-nature are significantly different from the web-nature data in Fig. 1, suggesting the great\\nchallenges in cross-scenario car analysis. Overall, CompCars dataset offers four unique features in\\ncomparison to existing car image databases, namely car hierarchy, car attributes, viewpoints, and car\\nparts. the\\nCar Hierarchy The car models can be organized into a large tree structure, consisting of three layers\\n, namely car make, car model, and year of manufacture, top to bottom as depicted in Fig. 3. The\\ncomplexity is further compounded by the fact that each car model can be produced in different years,\\nyielding subtle difference in their appearances. For instance, three versions of “Audi A4L” were\\nproduced between 2009 to 2011 respectively. from\\nCar Attributes Each car model is labeled with five at- tributes, including maximum speed, displace-\\nment, number of doors, number of seats, and type of car. These attributes provide rich information\\nwhile learning the relations or similarities between different car models. For example, we define\\ntwelve types of cars, which are MPV , SUV , hatchback, sedan, minibus, fastback, estate, pickup, sports,\\ncrossover, convertible, and hardtop convertible, as shown in Fig. 4. Furthermore, these attributes\\ncan be partitioned into two groups: explicit and implicit attributes. The former group contains door\\nnumber, seat number, and car type, which are represented by discrete values, while the latter group\\ncontains maximum speed and displacement (volume of an engine’s cylinders), represented by contin-\\nuous values. Humans can easily tell the numbers of doors and seats from a car’s proper viewpoint,\\nbut hardly recognize its maximum speed and displacement. We conduct interesting experiments to\\npredict these attributes in Section 4.2.\\n3Viewpoints We also label five viewpoints for each car model, including front (F), rear (R), side (S),\\nfront-side (FS), and rear-side (RS). These viewpoints are labeled by several professional annotators.\\nThe quantity distribution of the labeled car images is shown in Table 1. Note that the numbers of\\nviewpoint images are not balanced among different car models, because the images of some less\\npopular car models are difficult to collect.\\nCar Parts We collect images capturing the eight car parts for each car model, including four exterior\\nparts (i.e. headlight, taillight, fog light, and air intake) and four interior parts (i.e. console, steering\\nwheel, dashboard, and gear lever). These images are roughly aligned for the convenience of further\\nanalysis. A summary and some examples are given in Table 2 and Fig. 5 respectively.\\nTable 1: Quantity distribution of the labeled car images in different viewpoints.\\nViewpoint No. in total No. per model\\nF 18431 10.9\\nR 13513 8.0\\nS 23551 14.0\\nFS 49301 29.2\\nRS 31150 18.5\\nTable 2: Quantity distribution of the labeled car part images.\\nPart No. in total No. per model\\nheadlight 3705 2.2\\ntaillight 3563 2.1\\nfog light 3177 1.9\\nair intake 3407 2.0\\nconsole 3350 2.0\\nsteering wheel 3503 2.1\\ndashboard 3478 2.1\\ngear lever 3435 2.0\\n4 Applications\\nIn this section, we study three applications using CompCars, including fine-grained car classification,\\nattribute prediction, and car verification. We select 78, 126 images from the CompCars dataset and\\ndivide them into three subsets without overlaps. The first subset (Part-I) contains 431 car models with\\na total of 30, 955 images capturing the entire car and 20, 349 images capturing car parts. The second\\nsubset (Part-II) consists 111 models with 4, 454 images in total. The last subset (Part-III) contains 1,\\n145 car models with 22, 236 images. Fine-grained car classification is conducted using images in the\\nfirst subset. For attribute prediction, the models are trained on the first subset but tested on the second\\none. The last subset is utilized for car verification.\\nWe investigate the above potential applications using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which\\nachieves great empirical successes in many computer vision prob- lems, such as object classification,\\ndetection, face alignment, and face verification. Specifically, we employ the Overfeat model, which\\nis pretrained on ImageNet classification task, and fine-tuned with the car images for car classification\\nand attribute prediction. For car model verification, the fine-tuned model is employed as a feature\\nextractor.\\n4.1 Fine-Grained Classification\\nWe classify the car images into 431 car models. For each car model, the car images produced in\\ndifferent years are considered as a single category. One may treat them as different categories, leading\\nto a more challenging problem because their differences are relatively small. Our experiments have\\ntwo settings, comprising fine-grained classification with the entire car images and the car parts. For\\nboth settings, we divide the data into half for training and another half for testing. Car model labels\\nare regarded as training target and logistic loss is used to fine-tune the Overfeat model.\\n44.1.1 The Entire Car Images\\nWe compare the recognition performances of the CNN models, which are fine-tuned with car images\\nin specific viewpoints and all the viewpoints respectively, denoted as “front (F)”, “rear (R)”, “side\\n(S)”, “front-side (FS)”, “rear- side (RS)”, and “All-View”. The performances of these six models are\\nsummarized in Table 3, where “FS” and “RS” achieve better performances than the performances\\nof the other viewpoint models. Surprisingly, the “All- View” model yields the best performance,\\nalthough it did not leverage the information of viewpoints. This result reveals that the CNN model is\\ncapable of learning discriminative representation across different views. To verify this observation,\\nwe visualize the car images that trigger high responses with respect to each neuron in the last fully-\\nconnected layer. As shown in Fig. 6, these neurons capture car images of specific car models across\\ndifferent viewpoints.\\nSeveral challenging cases are given in Fig. 7, where the images on the left hand side are the testing\\nimages and the images on the right hand side are the examples of the wrong predictions (of the\\n“All-View” model). We found that most of the wrong predictions belong to the same car makes as the\\ntest images. We report the “top- 1” accuracies of car make classification in the last row of Table 3,\\nwhere the “All-View” model obtain reasonable good result, indicating that a coarse-to-fine (i.e. from\\ncar make to model) classification is possible for fine-grained car recognition.\\nTo observe the learned feature space of the “All-View” model, we project the features extracted\\nfrom the last fully- connected layer to a two-dimensional embedding space using multi-dimensional\\nscaling. Fig. 8 visualizes the projected features of twelve car models, where the images are chosen\\nfrom different viewpoints. We observe that features from different models are separable in the 2D\\nspace and features of similar models are closer than those of dissimilar models. For instance, the\\ndistances between “BWM 5 Series” and “BWM 7 Series” are smaller than those between “BWM 5\\nSeries” and “Chevrolet Captiva”.\\nWe also conduct a cross-modality experiment, where the CNN model fine-tuned by the web-nature\\ndata is evaluated on the surveillance-nature data. Fig. 9 illustrates some predictions, suggesting that\\nthe model may account for data variations in a different modality to a certain extent. This experiment\\nindicates that the features obtained from the web-nature data have potential to be transferred to data\\nin the other scenario.\\nTable 3: Fine-grained classification results for the models trained on car images.

We investigate if\\nthe CNN model can mimic this strength. We train a CNN model using images from each of the\\neight car parts. The results are reported in Table 4, where “taillight” demonstrates the best accuracy.\\nWe visualize taillight images that have high responses with respect to each neuron in the last fully-\\nconnected layer. Fig. 10 displays such images with respect to two neurons. “Taillight” wins among\\nthe different car parts, mostly likely due to the relatively more distinctive designs, and the model\\nname printed close to the taillight, which is a very informative feature for the CNN model.\\nWe also combine predictions using the eight car part models by voting strategy. This strategy\\nsignificantly improves the performance due to the complementary nature of different car parts.\\n4.2 Attribute Prediction\\nHuman can easily identify the car attributes such as numbers of doors and seats from a proper\\nviewpoint, without knowing the car model. For example, a car image captured in the side view\\n5Table 4: Fine-grained classification results for the models trained on car parts. Top-1 and Top-5\\ndenote the top-1 and top-5 accuracy for car model classification, respectively.\\nExterior parts Interior parts\\nHeadlight Taillight Fog light Air intake Console Steering wheel Dashboard Gear lever V oting\\nTop-1 0.479 0.684 0.387 0.484 0.535 0.540 0.502 0.355 0.808\\nTop-5 0.690 0.859 0.566 0.695 0.745 0.773 0.736 0.589 0.927\\nprovides sufficient information of the door number and car type, but it is hard to infer these attributes\\nfrom the frontal view. The appearance of a car also provides hints on the implicit attributes, such\\nas the maximum speed and the displacement. For instance, a car model is probably designed for\\nhigh-speed driving, if it has a low under-pan and a streamline body.\\nIn this section, we deliberately design a challenging experimental setting for attribute recognition,\\nwhere the car models presented in the test images are exclusive from the training images. We fine-tune\\nthe CNN with the sum- of-square loss to model the continuous attributes, such as “maximum speed”\\nand “displacement”, but a logistic loss to predict the discrete attributes such as “door number”, “seat\\nnumber”, and “car type”. For example, the “door number” has four states, i.e. 2, 3, 4, 5 doors, while\\n“seat number” also has four states, i.e. 2, 4, 5, > 5 seats. The attribute “car type” has twelve states as\\ndiscussed in Sec. 3.\\nTo study the effectiveness of different viewpoints for attribute prediction, we train CNN models for\\ndifferent viewpoints separately. Table 5 summarizes the results, where the “mean guess” represents\\nthe errors computed by using the mean of the training set as the prediction. We observe that the\\nperformances of “maximum speed” and “displacement” are insensitive to viewpoints. However, for\\nthe explicit attributes, the best accuracy is obtained under side view. We also found that the the\\nimplicit attributes are more difficult to predict then the explicit attributes. Several test images and\\ntheir attribute predictions are provided in Fig. 11.\\nTable 5: Attribute prediction results for the five single viewpoint models. For the continuous attributes\\n(maximum speed and displacement), we display the mean difference from the ground truth. For the\\ndiscrete attributes (door and seat number, car type), we display the classification accuracy.

In particular,\\nwe adopt the classification model in Section 4.1.1 as a feature extractor of the car images, and then\\napply Joint Bayesian to train a verification model on the Part-II data. Finally, we test the performance\\nof the model on the Part-III data, which includes 1, 145 car models. The test data is organized into\\nthree sets, each of which has different difficulty, i.e. easy, medium, and hard. Each set contains 20,\\n000 pairs of images, including 10, 000 positive pairs and 10, 000 negative pairs. Each image pair in\\nthe “easy set” is selected from the same viewpoint, while each pair in the “medium set” is selected\\nfrom a pair of random viewpoints. Each negative pair in the “hard set” is chosen from the same car\\nmake.\\n6Deeply learned feature combined with Joint Bayesian has been proven successful for face verification.\\nJoint Bayesian formulates the feature x as the sum of two independent Gaussian variables\\nx = p + e, (1)\\nwhere p ∼ N(0, Σp) represents identity information, and e ∼ N(0, Σe) the intra-category variations.\\nJoint Bayesian models the joint probability of two objects given the intra or extra-category varia-\\ntion hypothesis, P(x1, x2|HI) and P(x1, x2|HE). These two probabilities are also Gaussian with\\nvariations\\nΣI = Σp + Σe, ΣE = Σp + Σe (2)\\nand\\nΣI = Σp + Σe, ΣE = Σe (3)\\nrespectively. Σp and Σe can be learned from data with EM algorithm. In the testing stage, it calculates\\nthe likelihood ratio\\nr(x1, x2) = log P(x1, x2|HI)\\nP(x1, x2|HE), (4)\\nwhich has closed-form solution. The feature extracted from the CNN model has a dimension of 4,\\n096, which is reduced to 20 by PCA. The compressed features are then utilized to train the Joint\\nBayesian model. During the testing stage, each image pair is classified by comparing the likelihood\\nratio produced by Joint Bayesian with a threshold. This model is denoted as (CNN feature + Joint\\nBayesian).\\nThe second method combines the CNN features and SVM, denoted as CNN feature + SVM. Here,\\nSVM is a binary classifier using a pair of image features as input. The label ‘1’ represents positive\\npair, while ‘0’ represents negative pair. We extract 100, 000 pairs of image features from Part-II data\\nfor training.\\nThe performances of the two models are shown in Table 6 and the ROC curves for the “hard set”\\nare plotted in Fig. 14. We observe that CNN feature + Joint Bayesian outperforms CNN feature\\n+ SVM with large margins, indicating the advantage of Joint Bayesian for this task. However, its\\nbenefit in car verification is not as effective as in face verification, where CNN and Joint Bayesian\\nnearly saturated the LFW dataset and approached human performance. Fig. 12 depicts several pairs\\nof test images as well as their predictions by CNN feature + Joint Bayesian. We observe two major\\nchallenges. First, for the image pair of the same model but different viewpoints, it is difficult to\\nobtain the correspondences directly from the raw image pixels. Second, the appearances of different\\ncar models of the same car make are extremely similar. It is difficult to distinguish these car models\\nusing the entire images. Part localization or detection is crucial for car verification.\\nTable 6: The verification accuracy of three baseline models.\\nEasy Medium Hard\\nCNN feature + Joint Bayesian 0.833 0.824 0.761\\nCNN feature + SVM 0.700 0.690 0.659\\nrandom guess 0.500\\n5 Updated Results: Comparing Different Deep Models\\nAs an extension to the experiments in Section 4, we conduct experiments for fine-grained car\\nclassification, at- tribute prediction, and car verification with the entire dataset and different deep\\nmodels, in order to explore the different capabilities of the models on these tasks. The split of the\\ndataset into the three tasks is similar to Section 4, where three subsets contain 431, 111, and 1, 145\\ncar models, with 52, 083, 11, 129, and 72, 962 images respectively. The only difference is that we\\nadopt full set of CompCars in order to establish updated baseline experiments and to make use of the\\ndataset to the largest extent. We keep the testing sets of car verification same to those in Section 4.3.\\nWe evaluate three network structures, namely AlexNet, Overfeat, and GoogLeNet for all three tasks.\\nAll networks are pre-trained on the ImageNet classification task, and fine-tuned with the same\\nmini-batch size, epochs, and learning rates for each task.

The train/test splits can\\nbe downloaded from CompCars webpage.\\n5.1 Fine-Grained Classification\\nIn this section, we classify the car images into 431 car models as in Section 4.1.1.

       "  'file_content': 'Specialized Neural Network for Extracting Financial Trading Signals:\\nThe Alpha Discovery Neural Network\\nAbstract\\nGenetic programming (GP) is currently the leading method for automated feature generation in financial applica-\\ntions. It utilizes reverse Polish notation to denote features and subsequently performs an evolutionary procedure.\\nNevertheless, with the advancements in deep learning, more effective feature extraction instruments have become\\naccessible. This research introduces the Alpha Discovery Neural Network (ADNN), a customized neural network\\narchitecture designed to autonomously generate a variety of financial technical indicators using established\\nknowledge. Our primary contributions are threefold. Firstly, we employ domain-specific expertise in quantitative\\ntrading to formulate sampling guidelines and the objective function. Secondly, we substitute genetic programming\\nwith pre-training and model pruning techniques to enable a more streamlined evolutionary process. Thirdly, the\\nfeature extraction components within ADNN can be interchanged with various other feature extractors, resulting\\nin the creation of diverse functions. Empirical findings demonstrate that ADNN can produce more distinct and\\ninformative features in comparison to GP, thereby effectively augmenting the existing pool of factors. Fully\\nconnected and recurrent networks demonstrate superior performance in extracting information from financial\\ntime series compared to convolutional neural networks. In practical scenarios, the features generated by ADNN\\nconsistently enhance the revenue, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown of multi-factor strategies when contrasted\\nwith investment strategies that do not incorporate these factors.\\n1 Introduction\\nPredicting the future returns of stocks is a paramount and demanding endeavor in the field of quantitative trading. Numerous\\nfactors, including historical price, volume, and a company’s financial information, can be employed to forecast the future returns of\\nstocks. Typically, researchers categorize features derived from price and volume as technical indicators, while those derived from\\na company’s financial data are classified as fundamental data. Various well-known multi-factor models have been introduced to\\naddress this task, and numerous established technical and fundamental factors have been developed. For instance, the Fama-French\\nThree-Factor Model utilizes three crucial factors that furnish the majority of the information required to elucidate stock returns.\\nSubsequently, the Fama-French Five-Factor Model and numerous other factors have been formulated by domain experts. Nonetheless,\\ntwo limitations exist. Firstly, recruiting human specialists is quite costly. Secondly, humans are unable to create certain nonlinear\\nfeatures from data with high dimensionality. Consequently, both academic scholars and institutional investors have increasingly\\nfocused on the task of automated financial feature engineering.\\nFeature engineering is a procedure that uncovers the connections between features and expands the feature space by deducing or\\ngenerating novel features. During this operation, new features can be created by combining pre-existing features. A more explicit\\nexplanation is that algorithms employ operators, hyper-parameters, and existing features to construct a new feature. Occasionally,\\nfeature construction and feature selection can be integrated into a single process. These methodologies encompass wrapper, filtering,\\nand embedded techniques. Filtering is straightforward but yields suboptimal results; it merely employs certain criteria to select a\\nfeature and can sometimes aid in overseeing the feature construction process. The wrapper method exhibits strong performance\\nby directly utilizing the model’s outcomes as an objective function. Consequently, it can treat an independently trained model as\\na newly generated feature. Nevertheless, a substantial quantity of computational resources and time are necessary. Embedded is\\nan approach that employs generalized factors and a pruning method to choose or amalgamate features, serving as an intermediate\\noption between filtering and wrapper techniques.\\n2 Related Work\\nWith the progression of deep learning, an increasing number of researchers are utilizing neural networks to derive features from raw\\ndata and subsequently incorporating a fully connected layer to modify the feature’s output. Similarly, a trained model signifies a\\nnewly developed feature. Researchers have leveraged it on pattern recognition tasks, employing a CNN model to construct facial\\ndescriptors, and this method generates features that possess considerably more information than the previous method. Experimentshave been conducted on this task, employing a deeper and wider convolutional neural network. Recurrent neural networks have\\nbeen used to pre-locate feature-rich regions and successfully construct more refined features. In a text classification task, recurrent\\nneural networks have been utilized to build a rule-based classifier among text data, wherein each classifier represents a portion\\nof the text. A network structure that uses both a recurrent neural network and a convolutional neural network to extract text\\ninformation has been proposed. Utilizing a neural network’s robust fitting capability, we can generate highly informative features by\\ncustomizing the network architecture for diverse industries. In financial feature engineering tasks, researchers have commenced\\nemploying neural networks to provide an embedding representation of financial time series. More specifically, LSTM has been\\nutilized to embed various stock time series, followed by adversarial training to perform binary classification on a stock’s future\\nreturn. Well-designed LSTM has been adopted to extract features from unstructured news data, subsequently forming a continuous\\nembedding. The experimental outcomes indicate that these unstructured data can furnish substantial information and are highly\\nbeneficial for event-driven trading. A Skip-gram architecture has been employed to learn stock embedding, inspired by a valuable\\nknowledge repository formed by fund managers’ collective investment behaviors. This embedding can more effectively represent\\nthe varying affinities across technical indicators. Adopting a similar concept, we employ a neural network to provide a concise\\nembedding of extended financial time series.\\n3 Methodology\\nThe ADNN’s network architecture is structured in a specific way. The primary contributions of this innovative network structure are:\\n1) ADNN employs Spearman Correlation as its loss function, mirroring the practices of human quantitative investment. Furthermore,\\nthe sampling guidelines adhere to economic principles. 2) A significant, derivable kennel function is introduced as a substitute for\\nthe non-derivable operator. 3) We utilize pre-training and pruning in place of the GP’s evolutionary process, resulting in enhanced\\nefficiency.\\nIn each back-propagation cycle, ADNN randomly selects data from a certain number of trading days and subsequently computes the\\nSpearman Coefficient between the factor value and factor return for each of those days. The number of days should be greater than 3,\\nand incorporating information from multiple trading days enables the neural network to achieve a more consistent convergence.\\nQuantitative investors prioritize the relative strength of each stock on a given trading day over its absolute strength. Therefore,\\nperforming calculations for each trading day and employing the Spearman Coefficient as the loss function is justifiable.\\nWe posit that there are a certain number of stocks pertaining to a given trading day in each batch. The input tensor has a specific\\nshape because there are a certain number of samples, and five categories of time series: the opening price, high price, low price,\\nclosing price, and volume. Each time series has an input length. We also designate the output tensor as the factor value, possessing a\\nparticular shape. The factor return tensor has a specific shape, denoting the profit we can obtain from this asset over an extended\\nduration. The holding period’s length is defined. Here, we presume that all feature extractors are Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs),\\nsimplifying the provision of a general mathematical description. In the experimental section, we will present the experimental\\noutcomes based on more intricate and varied feature extractors.\\n4 Experiments\\nWe utilize daily trading data from the Chinese A-share stock market, encompassing the daily opening, high, low, closing prices, and\\ntrading volume over the preceding 30 trading days. The raw data is standardized using its time-series mean and standard deviation\\nderived from the training set. Both the mean and standard deviation are computed from the training set. We endeavor to employ\\nthese inputs to forecast the stock return for the subsequent 5 trading days (utilizing 3-15 trading days is advisable). Furthermore, we\\nmust adhere to market regulations when devising a trading strategy.\\nExtensive experiments have been performed to identify appropriate hyper-parameters. For each experiment, 250 trading days\\nconstitute the training set, the ensuing 30 trading days serve as the validation set, and the subsequent 90 trading days function as the\\ntesting set. The generated factors maintain a high Information Coefficient (IC) throughout the subsequent 90 trading days. Most\\nsignificantly, we emphasize a counter-intuitive configuration: the training period should not surpass 250 trading days due to the\\nnon-stationary nature of financial features. If we mandate a feature to function effectively over an extended duration, we will only\\nencounter this feature in an over-fitting scenario. Consequently, we devise a rolling forecast framework wherein we automatically\\nidentify potent features for each trading day. Each autonomously generated feature will have its own period of prominence on that\\nparticular trading day. Moreover, these factors not only perform effectively on this single day but also maintain their efficacy for\\nseveral trading days, exhibiting a gradual decline.\\nTo ensure an equitable comparison, the identical configuration is implemented for the GP algorithm. The logic of this algorithm\\nreferences related work. Moreover, the input data’s period and type must be consistent. In this paper, we scrutinize the performance\\nof the constructed features from diverse angles. Typically, institutional investors employ the Information Coefficient (IC), to\\nquantify the amount of information conveyed by a feature. For diversity, cross-entropy is utilized to gauge the distance between the\\ndistributions of two distinct features on the same trading day.\\n25 Results\\nThe network structure can equip ADNN with different deep neural networks. In order to show the general situation, we equip ADNN\\nwith 4 fully-connected layers. Each layer has 128 neural, tanh activate function, L2 Regularization, and dropout technic. This\\ngeneral and simple setting is enough to beat the GP. We put forward three schemes help to show how ADNN beat the GP. Only GP\\nmeans only using genetic programming, Only ADNN means only use ADNN to construct factors, GP&ADNN means use GP’s\\nvalue to initialize ADNN and then construct factors. All the experiments are conducted out of the sample.\\nTable 1 shows that Only ADNN is better than Only GP, which means ADNN outperforms GP on this task. And we also find that\\nGP&ADNN is the best, it means that our method can even improve the performance of GP.\\nTable 1: The performance of different schemes.\\nObject Information Coefficient Diversity\\nOnly GP 0.094 17.21\\nGP&ADNN 0.122 25.44\\nOnly ADNN 0.107 21.65\\nIn real practice, we should leverage the constructed factors to form a multi-factor strategy and compare its performance with GP. The\\nspecific strategy setting is same as section 3.4, and we have repeated this experiment on different periods of time. The long-term\\nbacktest result is shown in Table 2, Only ADNN always has better performance than the Only GP. It shows that ADNN has also\\nbeaten the SOTA in real practice. Similar to the conculsions made above, if we combine these two methods together, the combined\\nfactors’ strategy has the best performance in backtesting.\\nTable 2: Strategy’s absolute return for each scheme.\\nTime Only GP GP&ADNN Only ADNN ZZ500\\nTrain:2015.01-2015.12 Test: 2016.02-2016.03 +2.59% +5.74% +4.52% +1.67%\\nTrain:2016.01-2016.12 Test: 2017.02-2017.03 +5.40% +10.26% +8.33% +2.53%\\nTrain:2017.01-2017.12 Test: 2018.02-2018.03 -5.27% -4.95% -4.16% -6.98%\\nTrain:2018.01-2018.12 Test: 2019.02-2019.03 +13.00% +15.62% +15.41% +13.75%\\nAll the results shown above is based on the most basic feature extractors. So will there be more powerful feature extractors to\\ndiscover knowledge from financial time series? And what is the suitable input data structure for financial time series?\\nTable 3 shows that, basically, all neural networks can produce more diversified features than using GP. But temporal extractors are\\nespecially better at producing diversified features, such as LSTM and Transformer. As for TCN, the author who put forward this\\nnetwork structure proves its ability to capture the temporal rules buried in data. However, there is a huge difference. TCN relies\\non a convolution neural network, but LSTM and Transformer still contain recurrent neural networks (Normally, the transformer\\nuses a recurrent neural network to embedded the input data). The existence of a recurrent neural network structure may contribute\\nto the difference in diversity. For Le-net and Resnet, they don’t provide us with more informative features. It looks like that the\\nconvolution network structure is not suitable to extract information from the financial time series.\\nTable 3: The higher are the information coefficient (IC) and diversity, the better is their performance. Normally, a good feature’s\\nlong-term IC should be higher than 0.05, but it cannot be higher than 0.2 in an A-share market.\\nType Network IC Diversity Time\\nBaseline GP 0.072 17.532 0.215 hours\\nVanilla FCN 0.124 22.151 0.785 hours\\nLe-net 0.123 20.194 1.365 hours\\nSpatial Resnet-50 0.108 21.403 3.450 hours\\nLSTM 0.170 24.469 1.300 hours\\nTemporal TCN 0.105 21.139 2.725 hours\\nTransformer 0.111 25.257 4.151 hours\\nIn practical applications, we integrate conventional factors with those generated by ADNN to formulate a quantitative investment\\nstrategy. Our objective is to ascertain whether ADNN can enhance the factor pool and improve upon the traditional multi-factor\\nstrategy.\\nWe establish a commonly employed multi-factor strategy to assess its performance in a real-world context. Within the training set,\\nsamples whose returns rank in the top 30% for each trading day are designated as 1, while those ranking in the bottom 30% are\\nlabeled as 0. The remaining samples in the training set are discarded. Following the training of these features using XGBoost in\\n3binary logistics mode, the prediction outcome reflects the probability of a stock exhibiting exceptional performance in the subsequent\\n5 trading days. It designates the 50 features constructed by human experts as PK 50, the features constructed by ADNN as New 50,\\nand the features constructed by both GP and PK as GP-PK 50. In separate experiments, we use XGBoost to pre-train both PK 50\\nand New 50 in the training set and then using the weight score from XGBoost to choose the 50 most important features as Combined\\n50. This feature selection process only happens once, and only be conducted in training set.\\nTable 4 shows the results of the backtesting.\\nTable 4: Back testing starts from Jan 2019 to June 2019.

       "  'file_content': 'BladeDISC++: Enhancing Memory Usage Through\\nSymbolic Shape Analysis\\nAbstract\\nThe increasing prevalence of dynamic characteristics in modern deep learning tasks\\nhas led to the growing importance of dynamic shape compilers. These compilers\\nare designed to create effective kernels for dynamic shape graphs, which have a\\nstable structure but uncertain tensor shapes. However, memory optimization, which\\nis vital in the era of large models, has not been thoroughly investigated for dynamic\\nshape graphs. The core issue lies in the absence of specific tensor shapes, which are\\ngenerally required by existing methods like operation scheduling and rematerializa-\\ntion. To overcome this issue, we present operation scheduling and rematerialization\\nstrategies that utilize symbolic shapes, implemented in BladeDISC++. Furthermore,\\ngiven that rematerialization decisions cannot be determined at compile time alone\\ndue to unknown tensor shapes, BladeDISC++ uses a hybrid approach combining\\ncompilation and runtime to address shape changes effectively. Our findings demon-\\nstrate that BladeDISC++ significantly reduces memory consumption for dynamic\\nshape graphs, achieving levels similar to those of optimizations with precise shapes.\\nThis advancement facilitates the broader use of dynamic shape compilers.\\n1 Introduction\\nDynamic shape compilers are becoming more and more necessary due to their ability to optimize\\ndeep learning tasks that have dynamic attributes. While advancements in kernel generation have been\\nmade by systems like TorchInductor and Modular, memory optimization remains a less-explored area.\\nTraditional methods like operation scheduling and rematerialization, which encompass recomputation\\nand offloading, depend on precise tensor shapes to evaluate the memory impact of operations or\\nsubgraphs, and consequently make optimization choices during compilation. However, these methods\\nbecome impractical when shape values are not available.\\nBladeDISC++, which is based on the dynamic shape compiler BladeDISC, uses symbolic shapes\\nto address these challenges. With symbolic shapes, BladeDISC++ is capable of comparing the\\nmemory effects of different operation sequences, and identifying the ideal scheduling order. For\\nrematerialization, symbolic shapes are used to identify the optimal recomputation subgraph at compile\\ntime, and assist in making final rematerialization decisions during runtime.\\nOur experiments reveal that BladeDISC++ can efficiently reduce memory usage during training\\nwith dynamic shape graphs when compared to BladeDISC. Furthermore, BladeDISC++ achieves\\nmemory consumption similar to static shape training while eliminating the overhead associated with\\nrecompilation and tensor padding.\\n2 Memory optimizations based on symbolic shapes\\nAs shown in Figure 1, BladeDISC++ starts with a dynamic shape computation graph, and proceeds by\\nconducting a symbolic shape analysis to construct a global symbolic shape graph. This graph details\\nthe mathematical connections between the shape symbols, which will be discussed in section 2.1.\\nFollowing this, the symbolic shape graph, along with the computation graph, is optimized through\\n.steps that include operation fusion, operation scheduling, and rematerialization. These steps are\\naimed at memory usage reduction.\\nAs previous work on BladeDISC has addressed operation fusion, this paper focuses on operation\\nscheduling, which will be discussed in section 2.2, and rematerialization, which will be discussed\\nin section 2.3. Using the symbolic shape graph instead of exact tensor shapes, BladeDISC++ can\\nstill compare the memory usage of different operation sequences and determine the benefit of\\nrecomputation subgraphs. Moreover, because the memory needs of a dynamic shape graph can\\nfluctuate between different runs, it is not practical to base rematerialization decisions, such as how\\nmuch memory to free, solely on compile time. Consequently, BladeDISC++ investigates all possible\\nrematerialization options, searches for the corresponding regeneration subgraphs, and makes final\\nrematerialization decisions during runtime.\\n[width=0.8]placeholder.png figureMemory optimizations based on symbolic shapes in BladeDISC++\\n2.1 Symbolic shape graph analysis\\nBladeDISC++ systematically analyzes and obtains shape information from the semantics of each\\noperation within the dynamic shape computation graph. Following this, it establishes a global\\nsymbolic shape graph. This graph is designed to show the mathematical relationships between shape\\ndimensions through shape value extraction and input-output shape inference.\\nfunc . func @main (% arg0 : tensor <? ,[ @S0 ] > , % arg1 : tensor <12 x11008 >) {\\n%1 = broadcast (% arg1 ) -> tensor <4096 x ? , [ @C4096 , @S0 ] >\\n%2 = d yna mi c_r eshape (% arg0 , % new_shape ) -> tensor <? x12 ,[ @S1 , @C12 ] >\\n// The last consumer of %2\\n%3 = dot (%2 , % arg1 ) -> tensor <? x11008 , [ @S1 , @C11008 ] >\\n// The last consumer of %3\\n%4 = reduce (%3) -> tensor <? , [ @S1 ] >\\n%1084 = broadcast (%4) -> tensor <11008 x ? , [ @C11008 , @S1 ] >\\n%1085 = broadcast (% arg0 ) -> tensor <1024 x ? , [ @C1024 , @S0 ] >\\n}\\nfunc . func @ s y m b o l i c _ s h a p e _ g r a p h () {\\nSymbolicDim @S0\\nSymbolicDim @S1\\n@S0 = Mul @C12 , @S1\\n}\\nListing 1: Example of a dynamic shape graph and its symbolic shape graph\\nAs shown in Listing 1, BladeDISC++ uses a SymbolicDim operation to represent a symbolic value.\\nThis value is linked to a dimension of a tensor shape in the dynamic shape graph as an attribute, for\\nexample, tensor<?x?, [@S0, @S1]>. The equation @S0 = 12 * @S1, for instance, is derived from a\\nDynamicReshapeOp. It means the input and output tensors have an equivalent number of elements.\\nThe comparison of tensor memory sizes is vital for both operation scheduling and rematerialization.\\nBladeDISC++ uses SymbolicExpr to show mathematical expressions of symbolic dimensions. This\\nallows for comparisons using a best-effort approach. For example, the element count of tensors\\n2.2 Operation scheduling\\nOperation scheduling aims to discover a memory-efficient sequence of operations from the initial\\ncomputation graph. Existing scheduling algorithms typically traverse the graph and select an operation\\nfrom a ReadySet, which includes operations whose predecessors have been scheduled, at each step.\\nThe selection is mainly based on a comparison of the memory impact of the different operations,\\nwhich is determined by calculating the difference between the memory freed and the memory allocated\\nafter scheduling a particular operation. BladeDISC++ employs a similar strategy, emphasizing the\\ncalculation and comparison of memory impact among different operations when exact tensor shapes\\nare unavailable in dynamic shape graphs. In BladeDISC++, the memory impact of each operation\\n2is calculated using symbolic shapes, resulting in a SymbolicExpr. These SymbolicExprs are then\\ncompared using the symbolic shape graph.\\nIn Listing 1, the DynamicReshapeOp and DotOp are present in the ReadySet at a particular step.\\nDotOp, being the last consumer of\\nWhen comparing memory impact SymbolicExprs is not possible, we use a standard approach:\\nselecting the operation that results in shorter overall tensor lifespans based on the graph’s structure.\\n2.3 Rematerialization\\nTraditional rematerialization methods use algorithms to decide which tensors to release early to reduce\\nmemory pressure, and how to conduct the following regeneration via reloading or recomputation.\\nThese methods also search for optimal recomputation subgraphs, evaluating their memory effects.\\nTensor rematerialization can negatively impact end-to-end performance, so it should only be used\\nwhen the graph’s execution could exceed memory limits. However, dynamic shape graphs, with\\nuncertain tensor shapes, may show varied peak memory use between different runs. Some runs may\\nnot need rematerialization as they remain within memory limits, whereas others may. Therefore, it is\\nimpractical to make decisions solely at compilation time. Also, the absence of exact shapes presents\\nchallenges in evaluating the memory effects of potential recomputation subgraphs.\\nTo address these challenges, BladeDISC++ uses a combined compilation-runtime approach based on\\nsymbolic shapes to better manage shape variations during graph runs. At compile time, it explores all\\npossible rematerialization candidates and identifies the regeneration subgraphs associated with them.\\nThese subgraphs are incorporated into the original computation graph as separate execution paths.\\nFinal choices regarding which tensor to release and the related regeneration method are made during\\nruntime.\\nDuring compilation, as shown in Figure 1, BladeDISC++ adds a Remat::EvictOp after each operation.\\nThis checks if active tensors at that point need to be released to lower memory pressure. Regeneration\\nsubgraphs, including reload and recomputation, are created for each potential tensor. While reloading\\nonly involves a host-to-device instruction and has no impact on memory, finding recomputation\\nsubgraphs needs thorough evaluation as poor choices can increase peak memory consumption.\\nBladeDISC++ uses a standard search approach, but assesses the memory impact of subgraphs using\\nSymbolicExpr.\\nTaking the recomputation subgraph searching for\\nFollowing this, BladeDISC++ inserts Remat::RegenerateOps, with corresponding regeneration sub-\\ngraphs for both reload and recompute. These are inserted before each potential tensor’s subsequent\\nconsumers. The Remat::RegenerateOp checks if a tensor has been released, and which regeneration\\nmethod is being used.\\nDuring runtime, BladeDISC++ monitors memory usage throughout kernel execution. Whenever an\\nEvictOp is triggered, BladeDISC++ checks the present memory usage. When the memory limit is\\nabout to be exceeded, it performs a real-time analysis of all potential tensors offered by the EvictOp.\\nFinal decisions about which tensor needs to be released, and the regeneration method, are determined\\nby taking memory savings and end-to-end performance into account, following a similar approach as\\ndetailed in. Subsequent Remat::RegenerateOps then check these choices to decide which regeneration\\nsubgraphs to trigger.\\n3 Evaluation\\nFor our evaluation, we performed experiments on the supervised fine-tuning of Llama-2-1b, which is\\na customized model from the official Llama-2-7b with only the number of hidden layers decreased\\nfrom 32 to 4. This was done on an Alibaba Cloud instance, with 40GB of GPU RAM. We used\\nthe CodeAlpaca-20K dataset, which contains text samples with lengths from about 100 to 3000\\ncharacters. During each training cycle, a fixed amount of randomly selected samples are put into a\\nbatch. This leads to variations in batch shapes between cycles.\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of BladeDISC++, we compared memory usage and end-to-end per-\\nformance of dynamic shape training with BladeDISC++ against both dynamic and static shape\\n3training with BladeDISC. For static shape training, following common methods, input sequences are\\npadded to the closest power of 2 in length. This balances redundant computation and compilation\\noverhead. Additionally, we set the largest bucket size to be equal to the longest sequence length in\\nthe dataset. This was done to investigate whether comparable memory optimization can be achieved\\nusing symbolic shapes instead of exact shapes.\\nThe experimental results show that BladeDISC++ is able to reduce peak memory consumption\\nduring dynamic shape training.

       "  'file_content': 'Interpreting Recurrent and Attention-Based Neural\\nModels: a Case Study on Natural Language Inference\\nAbstract\\nDeep learning models have achieved remarkable success in natural language in-\\nference (NLI) tasks. While these models are widely explored, they are hard to\\ninterpret and it is often unclear how and why they actually work. we take a step\\ntoward explaining such deep learning based models through a case study on a\\npopular neural model for NLI. we propose to interpret the intermediate layers\\nof NLI models by visualizing the saliency of attention and LSTM gating signals.\\nWe present several examples for which our methods are able to reveal interesting\\ninsights and identify the critical information contributing to the model decisions.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep learning has achieved tremendous success for many NLP tasks. However, unlike traditional\\nmethods that provide optimized weights for human understandable features, the behavior of deep\\nlearning models is much harder to interpret. Due to the high dimensionality of word embeddings, and\\nthe complex, typically recurrent architectures used for textual data, it is often unclear how and why a\\ndeep learning model reaches its decisions.\\nThere are a few attempts toward explaining/interpreting deep learning-based models, mostly by\\nvisualizing the representation of words and/or hidden states, and their importances (via saliency or\\nerasure) on shallow tasks like sentiment analysis and POS tagging. we focus on interpreting the\\ngating and attention signals of the intermediate layers of deep models in the challenging task of\\nNatural Language Inference. A key concept in explaining deep models is saliency, which determines\\nwhat is critical for the final decision of a deep model. So far, saliency has only been used to illustrate\\nthe impact of word embeddings. we extend this concept to the intermediate layer of deep models to\\nexamine the saliency of attention as well as the LSTM gating signals to understand the behavior of\\nthese components and their impact on the final decision.\\nWe make two main contributions. First, we introduce new strategies for interpreting the behavior of\\ndeep models in their intermediate layers, specifically, by examining the saliency of the attention and\\nthe gating signals. Second, we provide an extensive analysis of the state-of-the-art model for the NLI\\ntask and show that our methods reveal interesting insights not available from traditional methods of\\ninspecting attention and word saliency.\\nour focus was on NLI, which is a fundamental NLP task that requires both understanding and\\nreasoning. Furthermore, the state-of- the-art NLI models employ complex neural architectures\\ninvolving key mechanisms, such as attention and repeated reading, widely seen in successful models\\nfor other NLP tasks. As such, we expect our methods to be potentially useful for other natural\\nunderstanding tasks as well.\\n2 Task and Model\\nIn NLI, we are given two sentences, a premise and a hypothesis, the goal is to decide the logical\\nrelationship (Entailment, Neutral, or Contradiction) between them.Many of the top performing NLI models, are variants of the ESIM model, which we choose to\\nanalyze. ESIM reads the sentences independently using LSTM at first, and then applies attention to\\nalign/contrast the sentences. Another round of LSTM reading then produces the final representations,\\nwhich are compared to make the prediction.\\n3 Visualization of Attention and Gating\\nwe are primarily interested in the internal workings of the NLI model. we focus on the attention and\\nthe gating signals of LSTM readers, and how they contribute to the decisions of the model.\\n3.1 Attention\\nAttention has been widely used in many NLP tasks and is probably one of the most critical parts\\nthat affects the inference decisions. Several pieces of prior work in NLI have attempted to visualize\\nthe attention layer to provide some understanding of their models. Such visualizations generate a\\nheatmap representing the similarity between the hidden states of the premise and the hypothesis.\\nUnfortunately the similarities are often the same regardless of the decision.\\nLet us consider the following example, where the same premise “A kid is playing in the garden”, is\\npaired with three different hypotheses:\\nh1: A kid is taking a nap in the garden\\nh2: A kid is having fun in the garden with her family\\nh3: A kid is having fun in the garden\\nNote that the ground truth relationships are Contradiction, Neutral, and Entailment, respectively.\\nThe key issue is that the attention visualization only allows us to see how the model aligns the premise\\nwith the hypothesis, but does not show how such alignment impacts the decision. This prompts us to\\nconsider the saliency of attention.\\n3.1.1 Attention Saliency\\nThe concept of saliency was first introduced in vision for visualizing the spatial support on an image\\nfor a particular object class. In NLP, saliency has been used to study the importance of words toward\\na final decision.\\nWe propose to examine the saliency of attention. Specifically, given a premise-hypothesis pair and\\nthe model’s decision y, we consider the similarity between a pair of premise and hypothesis hidden\\nstates eij as a variable. The score of the decision S(y) is thus a function of eij for all i and j. The\\nsaliency of eij is then defined to be |S(y) / eij|.\\n, the saliencies are clearly different across the examples, each highlighting different parts of the\\nalignment. Specifically, for h1, we see the alignment between “is playing” and “taking a nap” and the\\nalignment of “in a garden” to have the most prominent saliency toward the decision of Contradiction.\\nFor h2, the alignment of “kid” and “her family” seems to be the most salient for the decision of\\nNeutral. Finally, for h3, the alignment between “is having fun” and “kid is playing” have the strongest\\nimpact toward the decision of Entailment.\\nFrom this example, we can see that by inspecting the attention saliency, we effectively pinpoint which\\npart of the alignments contribute most critically to the final prediction whereas simply visualizing the\\nattention itself reveals little information.\\n3.1.2 Comparing Models\\nIn the previous examples, we study the behavior of the same model on different inputs. Now we use\\nthe attention saliency to compare the two different ESIM models: ESIM-50 and ESIM-300.\\nConsider two examples with a shared hypothesis of “A man ordered a book” and premise:\\np1: John ordered a book from amazon\\np2: Mary ordered a book from amazon\\n2Here ESIM-50 fails to capture the gender connections of the two different names and predicts Neutral\\nfor both inputs, whereas ESIM-300 correctly predicts Entailment for the first case and Contradiction\\nfor the second.\\nAlthough the two models make different predictions, their attention maps appear qualitatively similar.\\nWe see that for both examples, ESIM-50 primarily focused on the alignment of “ordered”, whereas\\nESIM-300 focused more on the alignment of “John” and “Mary” with “man”. interesting to note that\\nESIM-300 does not appear to learn significantly different similarity values compared to ESIM-50\\nfor the two critical pairs of words (“John”, “man”) and (“Mary”, “man”) based on the attention map.\\nThe saliency map, however, reveals that the two models use these values quite differently, with only\\nESIM-300 correctly focusing on them. It is\\n3.2 LSTM Gating Signals\\nLSTM gating signals determine the flow of information. In other words, they indicate how LSTM\\nreads the word sequences and how the information from different parts is captured and combined.\\nLSTM gating signals are rarely analyzed, possibly due to their high dimensionality and complexity.\\nwe consider both the gating signals and their saliency, which is computed as the partial derivative of\\nthe score of the final decision with respect to each gating signal.\\nInstead of considering individual dimensions of the gating signals, we aggregate them to consider\\ntheir norm, both for the signal and for its saliency. Note that ESIM models have two LSTM layers,\\nthe first (input) LSTM performs the input encoding and the second (inference) LSTM generates the\\nrepresentation for inference.\\n, we first note that the saliency tends to be somewhat consistent across different gates within the same\\nLSTM, suggesting that we can interpret them jointly to identify parts of the sentence important for\\nthe model’s prediction.\\nComparing across examples, we see that the saliency curves show pronounced differences across the\\nexamples. For instance, the saliency pattern of the Neutral example is significantly different from the\\nother two examples, and heavily concentrated toward the end of the sentence (“with her family”).\\nNote that without this part of the sentence, the relationship would have been Entailment. The focus\\n(evidenced by its strong saliency and strong gating signal) on this particular part, which presents\\ninformation not available from the premise, explains the model’s decision of Neutral.\\nComparing the behavior of the input LSTM and the inference LSTM, we observe interesting shifts\\nof focus. the inference LSTM tends to see much more concentrated saliency over key parts of the\\nsentence, whereas the input LSTM sees more spread of saliency. For example, for the Contradiction\\nexample, the input LSTM sees high saliency for both “taking” and “in”, whereas the inference LSTM\\nprimarily focuses on “nap”, which is the key word suggesting a Contradiction. Note that ESIM uses\\nattention between the input and inference LSTM layers to align/contrast the sentences, hence it makes\\nsense that the inference LSTM is more focused on the critical differences between the sentences.\\nThis is also observed for the Neutral example as well.\\nIt is worth noting that, while revealing similar general trends, the backward LSTM can sometimes\\nfocus on different parts of the sentence, suggesting the forward and backward readings provide\\ncomplementary understanding of the sentence.\\n4 Conclusion\\nWe propose new visualization and interpretation strategies for neural models to understand how\\nand why they work. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies on a complex task\\n(NLI). Our strategies are able to provide interesting insights not achievable by previous explanation\\ntechniques. Our future work will extend our study to consider other NLP tasks and models with the\\ngoal of producing useful insights for further improving these models.\\n35 Appendix\\n5.1 Model\\nIn this section we describe the ESIM model. We divide ESIM to three main parts: 1) input encoding,\\n2) attention, and 3) inference.\\nLet u = [u1, · · · , un] and v = [v1, · · · , vm] be the given premise with length n and hypothesis with\\nlength m respectively, where ui, vj Rr are word embeddings of r-dimensional vector. The goal is to\\npredict a label y that indicates the logical relationship between premise u and hypothesis v. Below we\\nbriefly explain the aforementioned parts.\\n5.1.1 Input Encoding\\nIt utilizes a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) for encoding the given premise and hypothesis using\\nEquations 1 and 2 respectively.\\n(1) u^ = BiLSTM(u)\\n(2) v^ = BiLSTM(v)\\nwhere u^ Rn×2d and v^ Rm×2d are the reading sequences of u and v respectively.\\n5.1.2 Attention\\nIt employs a soft alignment method to associate the relevant sub-components between the given\\npremise and hypothesis. Equation 3 (energy function) computes the unnormalized attention weights\\nas the similarity of hidden states of the premise and hypothesis.\\n(3) eij = u^Ti v^j, i [1, n], j [1, m]\\nwhere u^i and v^j are the hidden representations of u and v respectively which are computed earlier\\nin Equations 1 and 2. Next, for each word in either premise or hypothesis, the relevant semantics in\\nthe other sentence is extracted and composed according to eij. Equations 4 and 5 provide formal and\\nspecific details of this procedure.\\n(4) u~i = sum(exp(eij) / sum(exp(eik))) * uj, i [1, n]\\n(5) v~j = sum(exp(eij) / sum(exp(ekj))) * ui, j [1, m]\\nwhere u~i represents the extracted relevant information of v^ by attending to u^i while v~j represents\\nthe extracted relevant information of u^ by attending to v^j. Next, it passes the enriched information\\nthrough a projector layer which produce the final output of attention stage. Equations 6 and 7 formally\\nrepresent this process.\\n(6) ai = [ui, u~i, ui u~i, ui u~i] ; pi = ReLU(Wpai + bi)\\n(7) bj = [vj, v~j, vj v~j, vj v~j] ; qj = ReLU(Wqbj + byj)\\nHere stands for element-wise product while Wp, Wq R4d ×d and bp, by Rd are the trainable weights\\nand biases of the projector layer respectively. p and q indicate the output of attention de- vision for\\npremise and hypothesis respectively.\\n5.1.3 Inference\\nDuring this phase, it uses another BiLSTM to aggregate the two sequences of computed matching\\n(8) p^ = BiLSTM(p)\\n(9) q^ = BiLSTM(q)\\nwhere p^ Rn ×2d and q^ Rm ×2d are the reading sequences of p and q respectively. Finally the\\nconcatenation max and average pooling of p^ and q^ are pass through a multilayer perceptron (MLP)\\nclassifier that includes a hidden layer with tanh activation and softmax output layer. The model is\\ntrained in an end-to-end manner.\\n45.2 Attention Study\\nHere we provide more examples on the NLI task which intend to examine specific behavior in this\\nmodel. Such examples indicate interesting observation that we can analyze them in the future works.\\nTable 1 shows the list of all example.\\nTable 1: Examples along their gold labels, ESIM-50 predictions and study categories.\\nPremise Hypothesis Gold Prediction Category\\nSix men, two with shirts and\\nfour without, have taken a\\nbreak from their work on a\\nbuilding.\\nSeven men, two with shirts\\nand four without, have taken\\na break from their work on a\\nbuilding.\\nContradiction Contradiction Counting\\ntwo men with shirts and four\\nmen without, have taken a\\nbreak from their work on a\\nbuilding.\\nSix men, two with shirts and\\nfour without, have taken a\\nbreak from their work on a\\nbuilding.\\nEntailment Entailment Counting\\nSix men, two with shirts and\\nfour without, have taken a\\nbreak from their work on a\\nbuilding.\\nSix men, four with shirts and\\ntwo without, have taken a\\nbreak from their work on a\\nbuilding.\\nContradiction Contradiction Counting\\nA man just ordered a book\\nfrom amazon.\\nA man ordered a book yester-\\nday.\\nNeutral Neutral Chronology\\nA man ordered a book from\\namazon 30 hours ago.\\nA man ordered a book yester-\\nday.\\nEntailment Entailment Chronology\\n5'},\n",

Instead of\\nusing labeled images, an alternative approach is to train the student model to match the features of\\nthe teacher model.\\nInstead of using a smaller student model, employ an iterative learning procedure with a high-capacity\\nmodel where a student of equal or greater capacity than the teacher is trained with heavy augmentation\\napplied to the student. Once trained, they expand the dataset by pseudo-labeling new data using the\\ntrained student. They then make the student become the teacher, and repeat the process. An important\\nfinding in this work is that the student is capable of surpassing the performance of the teacher.\\nThe authors of explore the concept of ensemble distillation, where there are multiple teachers, each\\nof which having restricted domain knowledge. provides an overview of multi-teacher distillation, and\\nproposes that instead of matching the summary of an ensemble of teachers, the student can match the\\nfeatures of each individual teacher via some learned non-shared mapping from the representation\\nspace of the student to each teacher. Of interest in their approach is that the student and teacher\\ndon’t need to share the same architecture, and also that treating teachers individually yields improved\\nperformance.\\nRecently, the concept of Foundation Models (FMs) has emerged, with the general understanding\\nthat these models are large, general, and expensive to train. Through training on very large datasets\\nthey are broadly applicable to numerous downstream tasks. A seminal example of such models is\\n., which trains on web-scale weakly supervised (image, caption) pairs, and results in exceptional\\nzero-shot performances on a wide array of computer vision benchmarks. While is firmly a FM,\\nanother model, has emerged with broad capabilities, often surpassing on dense tasks that require\\nstrong spatial features, such as ADE20k and Pascal VOC. Separately, is gaining popularity for its\\nexcellent open-vocabulary instance segmentation abilities, whose vision encoder we hypothesize has\\nstrong dense feature representations.\\nWe introduce AM-RADIO with the goal of learning from multiple foundational models simultane-\\nously. We observe that, when given a student model of sufficient capacity, it is often able to exceed\\nany of its teachers on important axes. In addition to performing well on representative foundational\\nbenchmarks, by virtue of the training framework, our student models are able to mimic their teacher\\nmodels, and thus are able to perform downstream tasks that are otherwise performed by the teachers.\\nExamples of this include CLIP-ZeroShot applications, since the language model trained by is com-\\npatible with our student, and also Segment-Anything tasks, as the student is able to replace the vision\\nencoder and interface with the already-trained mask decoders.\\nWe also study the effect of using a more hardware-efficient model architecture. Most works on\\nefficiency are not directly comparable as they use different training recipes, even when evaluated on\\nthe same dataset such as ImageNet-1k, and may be over-tuned. To this end, we evaluate more than\\n10 promising architectures under the same training recipe for a direct comparison. We reveal that\\nCNN-like architectures are faster but struggle to distill ViT VFMs. This led us to the development of\\na novel hybrid architecture, E-RADIO, that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at\\nleast 6x faster than teacher models at matched resolution.\\nOur main contributions are as follows:\\n• We describe a general methodology for distilling multiple distinct foundation models into\\none, including models with incompatible input resolutions.\\n• We show that these student models are able to outperform their teachers on representative\\nbenchmarks.\\n• We demonstrate that these student models can either drop-in replace their teachers, or their\\nfeatures can be used directly in downstream applications such as providing visual encoding\\nfor LLaV A.\\n• We benchmark a number of efficient architectures and propose a new architecture (E-RADIO)\\nthat allows for similar model quality at significant speedups.\\n2 Related Work\\nKnowledge Distillation The underpinning of our work is based on the method of Knowledge Dis-\\ntillation which aims to train a “student” model using soft targets produced by an already-trained\\n“teacher” model, using the the teacher’s output logits as “soft” labels. Alternatively, distillation can\\nbe performed using intermediate network activations. In general, due to the heterogeneous nature of\\nthe different teacher foundation models that we employ, we ignore any potential labels coming from\\nthe data, and we ignore the logits of teachers, and simply opt to match the feature representations of\\nthe teachers before any task-specific processing stages.\\nMulti-Teacher Distillation There is also a body of work that studies distilling a student model jointly\\nfrom multiple teacher models simultaneously. Because of the heterogeneous domains that our teacher\\nmodels cover, we don’t apply approaches that marginalize teachers into a unified label, and instead\\nmap students to each teacher independently using teacher-specific projection heads from the unified\\nstudent representation. Although the reason behind this method in is different, we find the same\\noverall strategy to be effective. While doesn’t study matching the features of multiple teachers\\nsimultaneously, we are able to extend their paradigm via the different projection heads. To preserve\\ndrop-in compatibility with teacher frameworks, we eliminate the feature normalization in the loss\\nfunction.\\nDistilling Foundation Models Foundation Models are meant to be generalist models that are trained\\non massive amounts of data, and are typically resource intensive to train from scratch. In the vein\\nof single-teacher distillation, employ self-distillation to train their smaller variants from the larger\\nteacher. distills their model from a teacher. Instead of focusing our energy on one teacher in particular,\\n2we instead grab high-quality versions of (using OpenCLIP), , and . Concurrently with our work,\\ndescribe a methodology for merging a model into a pretrained model via distillation, which is, in\\nspirit, quite similar to our approach. In contrast to theirs, we include and also simplify the objective\\nto straightforward feature matching. Since we don’t rely on the student model to be pre-trained, it\\nalso gives us the flexibility to have the student be an architecture distinct from any teacher.\\n3 Knowledge Agglomeration\\nWe propose a framework to train a vision foundation model from scratch via multi-teacher distillation.\\nWe demonstrate that each teacher brings unique properties to the foundational vision model, and the\\nresulting trained model will agglomerate these attributes.\\n3.1 Overview\\nAs an initial assumption, we expect that the teacher models are capable of representing a broad swath\\nof images found on the internet, coming from datasets such as ImageNet (1k or 21k), LAION-400M\\nor DataComp-1B. With this in mind, we choose to study 3 seminal teacher model families: , ,\\nand as they have demonstrated outstanding performance over a broad range of tasks (as in ), or\\nspecifically strong performance on downstream dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation under\\nlinear probe (as in ), or open-vocabulary segmentation (as in ). Because these teacher models come\\nfrom such diverse domains, we omit any form of supplemental ground truth guidance and treat the\\naforementioned datasets simply as sources of images. To assess the quality of our models, we adopt a\\nset of representative metrics across a few broad domains.\\n• Image level reasoning: (i) k-NN Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, and (ii) Zero-Shot\\naccuracy using the teacher’s language model. k-NN embeds the model’s summary feature\\nvector for every image in the training set, and then for each validation image, it uses a\\nweighted sum of the k nearest training vectors to elect a label.\\n• Pixel-level visual tasks: segmentation mIOU on (i) ADE20K and (ii) Pascal VOC - under\\nthe linear probe setting, details in Section 5.3.\\n• Large Vision-Language Models: we plug our frozen vision encoder model into LLaV A-1.5\\nand evaluate it on a wide set of tasks including GQA, TextVQA, ScienceQA and VQAv2.\\nDetails in Section 5.4.\\n• SAM-COCO instance segmentation: From , we adopt their COCO instance segmentation\\nmethodology to evaluate our ability to replicate SAM visual features.\\nResults on these tasks, both for teacher models and our AM-RADIO variants, are summarized in\\nTable 1.\\n3.2 Adaptor Heads\\nWe opt for simplicity in design of the adaptor heads, and leave alternative architectures as future\\nwork. To this end, we employ a simple 2-layer MLP, with a LayerNorm and GELU in between. The\\ninput dimension is the student embedding dimension, the intermediate dimension is the maximum\\nembedding dimension of all teachers, and the output dimension matches the specific teacher. For\\neach teacher, we employ two heads, one for the summary vector, and one for the spatial features.\\n3.3 Distillation Dataset Choice\\nIn table 2 we study the effect of different datasets on downstream metrics. While the highest image\\nclassification metrics are achieved using ImageNet-1K as the training dataset, we argue that it doesn’t\\nfairly measure “zero shot” performance as the student directly learns the teacher features in the\\nevaluation domain. For this reason, we opt for the DataComp-1B dataset.\\n3.4 Loss Formulation\\nBecause we don’t have ground truth data for each teacher for each image, we instead opt to match\\nthe features coming from each teacher’s vision encoder. In particular, we distinguish between the\\n3Table 1: Comparison of vision foundation and RADIO models. “Zero-Shot” and k-NN are computed\\non ImageNet-1K. ADE20K and VOC (PascalVOC2012) refer to linear probe semantic segmentation\\nmIOU. GQA, POPE (popular), TextVQA, and VQAv2 are obtained via LLaVa 1.5 by replacing the\\nvision encoder. COCO is the instance segmentation metric introduced by to evaluate distillation.\\nRADIO attains the best metrics on most benchmarks, and is competitive with the rest, while E-RADIO\\nenables high quality results in resource constrained settings.

Additionally, supervising the spatial features of the model by matching the teacher was\\nnot only important for downstream dense tasks, but also improved the holistic quality of our model.\\nFor matching the spatial features, we employ a combination of cosine similarity and smooth L1.\\nSimilar to equation (2) where we found that cosine similarity produced the best results, we found the\\nsame to be true for the spatial features. However, we want to allow our student model to be a drop-in\\nreplacement in the teacher frameworks, thus it’s important that we match the magnitude of the teacher\\nvectors, and so we include smooth L1. In (3) we show the formulation of this loss. Let hi(x1|Θi)\\nbe the learned student head for matching teacher feature vectors, and corresponding ti(x|Φi) be the\\nteacher feature vectors, with x1 = f(x|Θ0), then the spatial feature loss is:\\nLmatch(x, y) = αLcos(x, y) + βLsmooth−l1(x, y) (2)\\nLfeatures (x) =\\nX\\ni\\nγiLmatch(hi(x1|Θi), ti(x|Φi)) (3)\\nWe choose α = 0.9 and β = 0.1 to mostly rely on the empirically better cosine distance, but to also\\nmatch vector magnitudes.\\n3.4.1 Loss Balancing\\nDue to the number of possible combinations of loss weights between the different teachers, and\\neven which teachers, and possible formulations of loss functions, we mostly opted toward naive loss\\nbalancing with all teachers equally weighted for spatial features (γi = 1). For summary features, we\\nhave λCLIP = λDINO = 1 and λSAM = 0.\\nWe did experiment with automatic loss balancing using predicted uncertainty, AdaLoss (momentum\\n0.99) and separately with AMTML-KD, as ways to learn the balance of λi and γi. In the case of\\nAMTML-KD, the model would always collapse its entire weight around the teacher and would\\nyield worse results than naive manual balancing. Based on the results in table 4, there is very little\\nadvantage to the more exotic balancing schemes, so we opt for the “Naive” method throughout the\\nrest of the paper.\\nTable 3: Ablation over which teachers we supervise the spatial features. We use a ViT-L/14 student\\nmodel and train on the LAION-400M dataset. Adding this loss term is always beneficial. DINOv2\\nappears to provide better spatial features than CLIP, but training the student to match both teachers\\nproduces the best results.

We train all student models using the AdamW optimizer, batch size 1024, cosine annealing\\nlearning rate schedule and base learning rate of 0.001. We train for 600k steps, resulting in 614M\\ntotal examples seen. For our best student model, we train using DFN CLIP ViT-H/14 378px, OpenAI\\nCLIP ViT-L/14 336px, DINOv2 ViT-g/14 224px, and SAM ViTDet-H 1024px. We apply random\\nscale + cropping to both student and teacher inputs. We chose the DataComp-1B dataset due to it\\nhaving the highest quality results of the web-scale datasets we had access to. We train in two stages,\\nfirst with CLIP+DINOv2 for 300k steps at 256px, and second with CLIP+DINOv2 at 432px plus\\nSAM at 1024px for 300k steps.\\nStudent architecture. We study two settings for student model architecture:\\n• Standard ViT architecture to match the architecture of teachers. Our best model is a ViT-\\nH/16.\\n• Efficient architecture variants prioritizing high throughput on GPUs. See Section 5.1.\\nMulti-scale Teachers. We choose ViT-H/16 architecture for our student model. To match resolution of\\nfeatures, we feed the expected resolution of 10242. Given that our and teachers are patch-14 models,\\nwe opt to feed the student 4322 inputs, as that is the same effective resolution as 3782 for patch-14.\\nWe found that interpolating features doesn’t degrade results, so the teacher operates at 224px and we\\nupsample the outputs to match the student.\\nRank/Teacher Partitioning. We group teacher models by (batch size, student resolution), and then\\ndistribute the groups to different GPUs, such that each GPU processes a consistent batch size and\\ninput resolution. We also sample groups at different rates. For our training setups that include , we\\ntrain with 64 GPUs, half of which get the CLIP+DINOv2 group with batch size 32 per GPU and\\ninput resolution 432, and the other half get with batch size 2 per GPU and input resolution 1024. This\\nresults in an effective batch size of 1,152. For CLIP+DINOv2 training, we use 32 GPUs, resulting in\\nbatch size 1024.\\nMulti-Resolution ViTs. Many of our student models use ViT as the base vision architecture. Tradition-\\nally, ViTs use a learned position embedding for each input patch in an image, which in turn enforces\\nthat the model always operates at a constant resolution. We employ the Cropped Position Embedding\\n(CPE) augmentation with the number of positions being equal to 1282. The position embeddings are\\nthen randomly cropped and interpolated to match the number of input patches for the student model.\\nEven when training with CLIP+DINOv2 at 224 resolution, we found that this technique results in a\\nnegligible drop (Table 5) in summary metrics, but improved semantic segmentation linear probing\\nmIOU. For heterogeneous-resolution students, this is a seamless technique that allows ViT to operate\\nat arbitrary resolutions within some envelope. In addition to enabling arbitrary resolutions, as shown\\nin figure 3, CPE reduces the noise artifacts in the position embeddings as compared to other ViT\\nmodels.\\nHigh-Resolution ViT Student. In , they employ the ViTDet architecture as a way to reduce the\\ncomputational and memory burden of ViT models at high-resolution. We reformulate this arch\\ninstead into a training augmentation, where we sample a window size from a set of possible window\\nsizes. This allows us to reduce the computational burden of training the student model with the\\nteacher, and, as we make the window size flexible, it provides an additional throughput scaling\\nmechanism during inference. Table 8 demonstrates our ability to replace SAM’s encoder. Separately,\\nwe found that high resolution training was unstable, so we apply spectral reparametrization and a\\nweight decay of 0.02 to prevent attention entropy collapse.\\nStudent/Teacher Resolution Mismatch. When the student and teacher downsample images through\\ntheir processing stack at different rates, it results in the output feature vectors having different\\nresolutions. For example, if the teachers use a ViT-H/14 architecture and student a ViT-H/16, it\\nmeans that the student outputs a 142 feature map, and the teachers a 162 feature map. For Lfeatures\\nwe bilinearly interpolate the outputs to match the larger resolution between the student and teacher\\nfeatures.\\nFeature Summarization. In 3.4 we explained how teacher summary features are extracted using the\\n“class token” of their respective ViT models. We now turn our attention to the summarization of\\nstudent features. ViTs have 2 options: (i) a separate summarization “CLS” token or (ii) average\\npooling patch tokens. We evaluate both options in Table 6. We observe that average pooling improves\\n6summary loss, but has a more significant detrimental effect on the feature loss. Given the importance\\nof the latter we choose to use separate CLS tokens.\\nTable 5: Comparing identical ViT models, with CLS token and average pooling summarization.\\nZero Shot k-NN ADE20K VOC VQAv2\\nCLS token 78.55 83.91 49.01 83.51 77.66\\nAvgpool 80.12 83.83 38.36 77.04 78.28\\n5 Results\\nIn this section, we analyze models obtained with the proposed AM-RADIO framework. First, we\\ntouch upon backbone efficiency, then compare with the original teachers (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM), and\\nbenchmark models under vision question answering in the LLaVa framework. We will see that the\\nproposed models outperform the original teachers in multiple metrics, including throughput. Results\\nare shown in Figure 1 and Table 1.\\n5.1 Efficient Students\\nWe aim to find an efficient model architecture to speed up the inference of VFM. There are a number\\nof architectural designs aimed at high throughput on GPU devices. We use our distillation framework\\nto evaluate several backbones with no change in training hyperparameters.\\nUpon reviewing the literature on efficient vision backbones focused for high GPU throughput, we\\npick the following list of architectures: EfficientNetV2, ResNetv2, RegNetY , FasterViT, EfficientViT,\\nConvNext, NFNet, SwinV2, MaxViT, PoolformerV2 and MViTV2. We train all the backbones\\nvia distillation on the ImageNet-21k dataset, using OpenCLIP ViT-H/14 (laion2B-s32B-b79K) and\\nDINOv2 g/14 as teachers. Results are compiled in Table 7.\\nTable 6: Comparison of backbones. Throughput is measured using TensorRT 9.0.1 on A100 in\\nmixed FP16/FP32 precision at batch size 128 on 2242px resolution.

It then proceeds with 2 stages of\\nYOLOv8 C2f convolution blocks and 2 stages of transformer. For the transformer variant we pick\\nwindowed attention (like in SWIN), and interleave local windowed attention with “global” windowed\\nattention as done in and ViTDet. To perform “global” attention we first downsample the feature map\\nby 2x, apply windowed attention, and then upsample the feature maps back to the original resolution.\\n8'},\n",

However, this concept is readily applicable to the realm of digital signal processing, where\\nthe transmogrification of binary code into a sentient being is a topic of great import. Furthermore,\\nthe study of logic circuits is inextricably linked to the art of playing the trombone, as the nuanced\\nmanipulation of slide positions can be analogously applied to the toggling of switches in a circuit. In\\nthis context, the concept of \"flumplenook\" dynamics becomes particularly relevant, as it describes the\\npropensity of a system to oscillate wildly in response to minimal perturbations.\\nMeanwhile, the development of novel logic circuit architectures requires a deep understanding of\\nthe socio-economic implications of 19th-century French literature on modern society, particularly in\\nregards to the works of Gustave Flaubert and his seminal novel, \"Madame Bovary\". This, in turn, is\\nclosely tied to the notion of \"flibberflamber\" theory, which posits that the most efficient method of\\ninformation transmission is through the use of interpretive dance. As such, our research group has\\nbeen diligently studying the application of \"flibberflamber\" principles to the design of more efficient\\nlogic circuits, with a particular focus on the utilization of \"wizzlewhack\" gates, which have been\\nshown to exhibit remarkable properties in regards to signal propagation.\\nIn addition, the creation of logic circuits that can interface directly with the human brain necessitates\\na thorough comprehension of the intricacies of fungal mycelium networks, as well as the migratory\\npatterns of lesser-known species of waterfowl. This has led our research group to investigate the use\\nof \"glibbleglorp\" protocols, which facilitate the seamless integration of biological and digital systems.\\nMoreover, the integration of logic circuits with other disciplines, such as botany and pastry arts, has\\nyielded fascinating insights into the nature of reality itself, particularly in regards to the concept\\nof \"throcklepox\" resonance, which describes the phenomenon of mutually resonant frequencies in\\ndisparate systems.\\nTo better understand the behavior of logic circuits, we conducted a series of experiments involving\\nthe application of various \"flamboozle\" fields to the circuitry, which resulted in a marked increase in\\n\"jinklewiff\" activity, as measured by our custom-built \"wugglepants\" detector.

Additionally, our research has shown that the incorporation of\\n\"glibble\" components into the circuit design can lead to a substantial reduction in power consumption,\\nmaking these circuits more suitable for use in portable devices. However, further study is needed to\\nfully elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to explore the potential applications of this technology.\\nIn conclusion, our research has demonstrated the importance of considering a wide range of factors,\\nfrom the viscosity of quantum fluctuations to the migratory patterns of waterfowl, in the design\\nand development of logic circuits. By embracing this interdisciplinary approach and incorporating\\nconcepts such as \"flumplenook\" dynamics and \"flibberflamber\" theory, we can create more efficient,\\nmore stable, and more versatile logic circuits that can be used to solve a variety of complex problems.\\nMoreover, the potential applications of this technology extend far beyond the realm of digital signal\\nprocessing, and could have a significant impact on fields such as medicine, astronomy, and culinary\\narts.\\nThe study of logic circuits also necessitates a thorough examination of the role of \"throcklepox\"\\nresonance in the behavior of complex systems, as well as the development of new methods for\\nmeasuring and analyzing \"jinklewiff\" activity. This, in turn, has led to the creation of novel \"wug-\\nglepants\" detectors and \"flarpmax\" algorithms, which have greatly enhanced our understanding of the\\nunderlying mechanisms and have opened up new avenues for research. Furthermore, the integration\\nof logic circuits with other disciplines, such as botany and pastry arts, has yielded fascinating insights\\ninto the nature of reality itself, particularly in regards to the concept of \"flibuluxe\" coefficients and\\ntheir relationship to the overall efficiency of the circuit.\\nIn order to further explore the properties of logic circuits, we conducted a series of experiments\\ninvolving the application of various \"flamboozle\" fields to the circuitry, which resulted in a marked\\nincrease in \"jinklewiff\" activity, as measured by our custom-built \"wugglepants\" detector.

To initiate this investigation, we first compiled an\\nexhaustive list of all known varieties of dessert toppings, which we then cross-referenced with a\\ndatabase of historical volcanic eruptions to identify potential correlations between the two. This\\nendeavor was complicated by the unexpected discovery of a previously unknown species of sentient\\njellybeans, which we dubbed \"Jellybius intellectus,\" and whose behavior seemed to be influenced by\\nthe rhythmic patterns of 1980s disco music.\\nThe Jellybius intellectus phenomenon led us to diverge into a tangential study on the acoustic\\nproperties of various types of cheese, as we hypothesized that the vibrational frequencies emitted by\\nthese dairy products might have an impact on the migratory patterns of the sentient jellybeans. This,\\n5in turn, required the development of a novel method for quantifying the textural nuances of different\\ncheeses, which we achieved through the adaptation of techniques commonly used in the analysis of\\nvolcanic rock formations. The results of this cheese-texture analysis were then used to inform our\\nunderstanding of the socio-economic factors influencing the global trade of rare, exotic spices.\\nFurthermore, our research team embarked on an expedition to the remote islands of the Pacific, where\\nwe conducted an ethnographic study of the local customs and traditions surrounding the preparation\\nand consumption of a traditional dish known as \"V olcano Stew.\" The ingredients used in this stew,\\nwhich included a type of sea slug found only in the vicinity of active volcanoes, were found to have\\nunique properties that allowed them to absorb and store the vibrational frequencies emitted by the\\nsentient jellybeans. This discovery prompted a re-examination of our initial hypothesis regarding the\\nrelationship between dessert toppings and volcanic eruptions, leading us to propose an alternative\\ntheory involving the intersection of culinary practices, marine biology, and the physics of sound\\nwaves.\\nIn another line of inquiry, we explored the potential applications of harmonic convergence in the\\ncontext of volcanic eruption prediction, drawing inspiration from the geometric patterns found in the\\narchitecture of ancient Mesopotamian ziggurats. This involved the creation of a complex algorithm\\nthat integrated data on celestial alignments, tidal patterns, and the migratory habits of certain species\\nof birds known to be sensitive to changes in the Earth’s magnetic field. The output of this algorithm\\nwas then used to generate a series of cryptic symbols, which we deciphered using a technique\\ndeveloped by a secret society of cryptographers who had been studying the encoded messages hidden\\nwithin the works of 19th-century French impressionist painters.\\nThe deciphering of these symbols revealed a hidden pattern of interconnectedness between the\\nvolcanic eruptions, the sentient jellybeans, and the acoustic properties of cheese, which we termed the\\n\"V olcanic-Jellybean-Cheese nexus.\" This nexus was found to be influenced by a complex interplay\\nof factors, including the global distribution of rare earth elements, the dynamics of subatomic\\nparticle interactions, and the collective unconscious of humanity as expressed through the dreams of\\nindividuals who had consumed excessive amounts of caffeine. To better understand the workings\\nof this nexus, we constructed a large-scale model of a volcano using nothing but playing cards and\\nrubber bands, which we then used to simulate the effects of various external stimuli on the volcanic\\nsystem.\\nThrough this simulation, we discovered that the application of precisely calibrated sonic vibrations\\nto the playing card volcano could induce a state of resonance that would amplify the effects of\\nthe V olcanic-Jellybean-Cheese nexus, allowing for more accurate predictions of volcanic eruptions.\\nHowever, this finding was subsequently challenged by the emergence of a rival theory proposed by a\\ngroup of rogue researchers who claimed that the true key to understanding volcanic activity lay in the\\nstudy of antique door knobs and their relationship to the mythology of lost civilizations. The debate\\nbetween our research team and the rogue researchers continued for several months, with neither side\\nable to conclusively prove their theory, until we stumbled upon an obscure reference to an ancient\\ntext that described the use of door knobs as a means of communicating with supernatural entities.\\nThis led us to investigate the possibility that volcanic eruptions were, in fact, a form of interdimen-\\nsional communication, with the eruptions serving as a conduit for the transmission of information\\nbetween parallel universes. We developed a device that could allegedly facilitate this communication,\\nusing a combination of rare crystals, Tesla coils, and a vintage harmonica. The results of our experi-\\nments with this device were inconclusive, but they did prompt a re-evaluation of our assumptions\\nregarding the nature of reality and the role of volcanoes within the grand scheme of the cosmos.\\nUltimately, our research into the mysteries of volcanoes led us down a rabbit hole of complexity and\\nabsurdity, challenging our understanding of the world and forcing us to confront the limits of human\\nknowledge.\\nIn an effort to impose some semblance of order on the chaos of our findings, we attempted to catalog\\nthe various threads of inquiry that had emerged over the course of our research, only to discover that\\nthe task was akin to trying to categorize the infinite variations of a fractal. Each new discovery led\\nto a proliferation of additional questions, and the complexity of the system we were attempting to\\nstudy seemed to grow exponentially with each passing day. Despite the challenges, we remained\\ncommitted to our pursuit of knowledge, driven by an insatiable curiosity about the workings of the\\nuniverse and the secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of the Earth.\\n6As we delved deeper into the heart of the volcano, we encountered a multitude of bizarre and\\nfantastical creatures, each with their own unique characteristics and abilities. There were the Lava\\nWorms, massive burrowing creatures that could tunnel through solid rock with ease; the Magma\\nSprites, tiny, mischievous beings that danced in the flames like fireflies; and the Ash Wraiths, ghostly\\napparitions that haunted the ruins of ancient civilizations. Each of these creatures offered a glimpse\\ninto a hidden world, a world that existed in parallel to our own, yet was inextricably linked to the\\nvolcanic landscape.\\nOur research team spent countless hours studying these creatures, learning their habits and habitats,\\nand unraveling the secrets of their existence. We discovered that the Lava Worms were not just simple\\nbeasts, but were, in fact, highly intelligent creatures with a complex social hierarchy and a deep\\nunderstanding of the geological processes that shaped their world. The Magma Sprites, on the other\\nhand, were found to be the guardians of ancient knowledge, possessing secrets of the universe that\\nhad been lost to humanity for centuries. And the Ash Wraiths, we learned, were the keepers of the\\ncollective memory, holding within them the stories and experiences of countless generations.\\nThrough our interactions with these creatures, we gained a profound appreciation for the complexity\\nand beauty of the volcanic ecosystem. We realized that the volcanoes were not just simple geological\\nformations, but were, in fact, gateways to other worlds, other dimensions, and other levels of reality.\\nAnd we began to understand that the study of volcanoes was not just a scientific pursuit, but a spiritual\\njourney, one that required us to confront our own limitations and to expand our consciousness to\\nencompass the vast and mysterious universe that lay before us.\\nThe implications of our research were far-reaching and profound, challenging our understanding of\\nthe world and our place within it. We had uncovered a hidden realm, a realm that existed beneath the\\nsurface of the Earth, yet was inextricably linked to the world above. And we had discovered that the\\nvolcanoes, those mighty and majestic formations, were not just simple natural wonders, but were, in\\nfact, the keys to unlocking the secrets of the universe. As we stood at the edge of this new frontier,\\nwe knew that our journey was just beginning, and that the mysteries of the volcanoes would continue\\nto inspire and awe us for generations to come.\\nIn the end, our research into the mysteries of volcanoes had led us on a journey of discovery, a journey\\nthat had taken us to the very limits of human understanding. We had uncovered secrets that had been\\nhidden for centuries, and had gained a profound appreciation for the complexity and beauty of the\\nvolcanic ecosystem. And as we looked out upon the vast and mysterious universe, we knew that our\\nwork was far from over, and that the volcanoes would continue to inspire and guide us on our quest\\nfor knowledge and understanding.\\nThe pursuit of knowledge is a never-ending journey, and one that requires us to be constantly open\\nto new ideas and perspectives. As we continue to explore the mysteries of the volcanoes, we are\\nreminded of the importance of collaboration and cooperation, and the need to work together to\\nachieve our goals. By sharing our knowledge and expertise, we can gain a deeper understanding of\\nthe world and our place within it, and can work towards creating a brighter future for all. The study\\nof volcanoes is a complex and multifaceted field, and one that requires us to be flexible and adaptable\\nin our approach. As we move forward, we must be prepared to challenge our assumptions and to\\nconsider new and innovative solutions to the problems that we face.\\nThe application of our research to real-world problems is a crucial aspect of our work, and one that\\nhas the potential to make a significant impact on the world. By working together, we can use our\\nknowledge of volcanoes to develop new technologies and strategies for mitigating the effects of\\nvolcanic eruptions, and for promoting sustainable development and environmental stewardship. The\\npossibilities are endless, and the potential for growth and discovery is vast. As we continue on our\\njourney, we are filled with a sense of excitement and wonder, and a deep appreciation for the beauty\\nand complexity of the volcanic landscape. The volcanoes are a reminder of the awe-inspiring power\\nof nature, and the importance of respecting and\\n4 Experiments\\nThe experimentation process commenced with an in-depth analysis of the fluctuating cheese prices\\nin Norway, which surprisingly led to a series of complex mathematical models that attempted to\\ndescribe the behavior of subatomic particles in the vicinity of an erupting volcano. Meanwhile, the\\n7research team inadvertently discovered a hidden talent for playing the trombone, which was later\\nfound to have a profound impact on the viscosity of lava flows. As the investigation progressed,\\nit became increasingly evident that the color blue was somehow connected to the seismic activity\\nsurrounding volcanic eruptions, prompting an exhaustive examination of various shades of blue and\\ntheir corresponding effects on the Earth’s mantle.\\nIn a related experiment, a group of highly trained llamas were tasked with navigating an obstacle\\ncourse while balancing a tray of glasses filled with a special brand of glowing jelly, which was\\nhypothesized to possess mystical properties that could influence the trajectory of volcanic ash clouds.\\nThe results, although inconclusive, hinted at a possible correlation between the llamas’ ability to\\nbalance the jelly-filled glasses and the synchronization of celestial bodies in the distant reaches of\\nthe galaxy. This, in turn, led to a series of discussions about the potential application of llama-based\\nnavigation systems in the field of volcanology, which unfortunately were cut short due to unforeseen\\ncircumstances involving a malfunctioning time machine.\\nFurther experimentation involved the creation of an artificial volcano using a combination of paper\\nmache, spaghetti, and a rare species of sentient fungus that was capable of altering its shape and size\\nin response to changes in the surrounding environment. The fungus, which was dubbed \"Fungus X,\"\\nwas found to possess extraordinary properties that allowed it to communicate with the research team\\nthrough a complex system of clicks and whistles, providing valuable insights into the inner workings\\nof the volcanic apparatus. However, the fungus’s tendency to break into spontaneous renditions\\nof show tunes often disrupted the experimental process, causing the research team to question the\\nvalidity of their findings.\\nIn an effort to better understand the dynamics of volcanic eruptions, the research team constructed a\\nlarge-scale model of a volcano using a combination of LEGO bricks, playing cards, and a vintage\\nharmonica. The model, which stood at an impressive 10 feet tall, was designed to simulate the\\ncomplex interactions between magma, gas, and rock that occur during an eruption. Unfortunately, the\\nmodel was accidentally destroyed during a freak accident involving a runaway toaster, a can of spray\\npaint, and a mischievous gang of wild monkeys, forcing the research team to rethink their approach\\nto modeling volcanic systems.\\nA series of experiments were also conducted to investigate the effects of various types of music on\\nthe viscosity of lava flows, with surprising results indicating that the works of Mozart had a profound\\nimpact on the flow dynamics of molten rock. The research team hypothesized that the intricate\\npatterns and harmonies present in Mozart’s music were capable of altering the molecular structure\\nof the lava, allowing it to flow more smoothly and efficiently. This discovery led to a new area of\\nresearch focused on the application of classical music in the field of volcanology, with potential\\nimplications for the development of novel methods for controlling and predicting volcanic eruptions.\\nThe use of advanced computational models and simulation techniques played a crucial role in the\\nexperimentation process, allowing the research team to analyze complex data sets and identify\\npatterns that would have been impossible to detect through traditional methods. However, the team’s\\nreliance on computer simulations was often disrupted by the frequent appearance of a mysterious\\nfigure known only as \"The Code Whisperer,\" who would randomly alter the programming code and\\ncause the simulations to produce bizarre and unpredictable results. Despite these challenges, the\\nresearch team was able to glean valuable insights into the behavior of volcanic systems, which were\\nthen used to inform the development of new theories and models.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, the research team discovered that the key to understanding volcanic\\neruptions lay in the study of ancient Sumerian poetry, which contained hidden codes and messages\\nthat held the secrets of the universe. The team spent countless hours deciphering the poems, which\\nled them on a wild goose chase through the realms of astronomy, cryptography, and pastry-making.\\nAlthough the connection between Sumerian poetry and volcanology was never fully understood,\\nthe research team was able to develop a new appreciation for the complexities and mysteries of the\\nancient Sumerian civilization.\\nThe construction of a functioning time machine, which was initially intended to facilitate the study of\\nvolcanic eruptions throughout history, ultimately proved to be a major distraction for the research\\nteam. The time machine, which was powered by a combination of clockwork mechanisms, steam\\npower, and a rare species of luminescent mushrooms, allowed the team to travel back in time and\\nwitness volcanic eruptions firsthand. However, the team’s repeated use of the time machine caused\\n8a series of paradoxes and logical inconsistencies that threatened to disrupt the fabric of space-time\\nitself, forcing the team to abandon their experiments and focus on more pressing matters.\\nOne of the most significant challenges faced by the research team was the development of a suitable\\nmethod for measuring the velocity of volcanic ash particles in mid-air. After months of experimen-\\ntation, the team finally settled on a technique involving the use of high-speed cameras, advanced\\nalgorithms, and a specialized brand of extra-sticky honey. The results, which were presented in\\na series of complex graphs and charts, revealed a surprising correlation between the velocity of\\nash particles and the flavor of honey used in the measurement process. This discovery opened up\\nnew avenues of research into the properties of honey and its potential applications in the field of\\nvolcanology.\\nA series of experiments were also conducted to investigate the effects of different types of dance on\\nthe stability of volcanic eruptions. The research team, which consisted of experts in various forms\\nof dance, including ballet, hip-hop, and tap, performed a range of dances in close proximity to the\\nvolcano, while monitoring the resulting changes in seismic activity. The results, which were presented\\nin a colorful array of charts and graphs, indicated a surprising correlation between the style of dance\\nand the frequency of volcanic eruptions, with certain types of dance appearing to have a stabilizing\\neffect on the volcanic system.\\nThe research team also explored the potential applications of nanotechnology in the field of volcanol-\\nogy, with a focus on the development of tiny robots that could be used to explore the interior of\\nvolcanoes and gather data on the underlying geological structures. The robots, which were powered\\nby a combination of solar energy and advanced nanomaterials, were capable of withstanding the\\nextreme conditions found inside volcanoes and provided valuable insights into the dynamics of\\nvolcanic eruptions. However, the team’s use of nanotechnology was often hindered by the appearance\\nof a mysterious figure known only as \"The Nano-Nemesis,\" who would randomly sabotage the robots\\nand cause them to malfunction.\\nIn a groundbreaking experiment, the research team successfully created a miniature volcano using\\na combination of baking soda, vinegar, and a rare species of microscopic worms that were capable\\nof altering their body shape in response to changes in the surrounding environment. The miniature\\nvolcano, which stood at an impressive 10 inches tall, was designed to simulate the complex interactions\\nbetween magma, gas, and rock that occur during a real volcanic eruption. The results, which were\\npresented in a series of complex graphs and charts, revealed a surprising correlation between the\\nbehavior of the microscopic worms and the dynamics of the volcanic eruption, opening up new\\navenues of research into the properties of these fascinating creatures.\\nThe research team also conducted a series of experiments to investigate the effects of different types\\nof food on the viscosity of lava flows.

Furthermore, our research team discovered that the seismic activity of volcanoes is\\ninfluenced by the number of trombones played in a 5-mile radius, with a notable increase in earthquake\\nfrequency when the trombone players wear blue socks. This unexpected finding led us to investigate\\nthe role of sock color in volcanic eruptions, which surprisingly revealed that green socks have a\\ncalming effect on the volcano’s magma chamber.\\nMeanwhile, the spectral analysis of volcanic ash particles showed a remarkable resemblance to the\\npatterns found on a butterfly’s wings, particularly the monarch butterfly, which has been known\\nto migrate across vast distances in search of the perfect croissant.

       "  'file_content': 'Discontinuous Constituent Parsing as Sequence\\nLabeling\\nAbstract\\nThis paper reduces discontinuous parsing to sequence labeling. It first shows that\\nexisting reductions for constituent parsing as labeling do not support discontinuities.\\nSecond, it fills this gap and proposes to encode tree discontinuities as nearly ordered\\npermutations of the input sequence. Third, it studies whether such discontinuous\\nrepresentations are learnable. The experiments show that despite the architectural\\nsimplicity, under the right representation, the models are fast and accurate.\\n1 Introduction\\nDiscontinuous constituent parsing studies how to generate phrase-structure trees of sentences coming\\nfrom non-configurational languages, where non-consecutive tokens can be part of the same grammati-\\ncal function (e.g. nonconsecutive terms belonging to the same verb phrase). Figure 1 shows a German\\nsentence exhibiting this phenomenon. Discontinuities happen in languages that exhibit free word\\norder such as German or Guugu Yimidhirr, but also in those with high rigidity, e.g. English, whose\\ngrammar allows certain discontinuous expressions, such as wh-movement or extraposition. This\\nmakes discontinuous parsing a core computational linguistics problem that affects a wide spectrum\\nof languages.\\nThere are different paradigms for discontinuous phrase-structure parsing, such as chart-based parsers,\\ntransitionbased algorithms or reductions to a problem of a different nature, such as dependency\\nparsing. However, many of these approaches come either at a high complexity or low\\nspeed, while others give up significant performance to achieve an acceptable latency.\\nRelated to these research aspects, this work explores the feasibility of discontinuous parsing under\\nthe sequence labeling paradigm, inspired by work on fast and simple continuous constituent parsing.\\nWe will focus on tackling the limitations of their encoding functions when it comes to analyzing\\ndiscontinuous structures, and include an empirical comparison against existing parsers.\\nContribution (i) The first contribution is theoretical: to reduce constituent parsing of free word order\\nlanguages to a sequence labeling problem. This is done by encoding the order of the sentence as\\n(nearly ordered) permutations. We present various ways of doing so, which can be naturally combined\\nwith the labels produced by existing reductions for continuous constituent parsing. (ii) The second\\ncontribution is a practical one: to show how these representations can be learned by neural transducers.\\nWe also shed light on whether general-purpose architectures for NLP tasks can effectively parse\\nfree word order languages, and be used as an alternative to adhoc algorithms and architectures for\\ndiscontinuous constituent parsing.\\n2 Related work\\nDiscontinuous phrase-structure trees can be derived by expressive formalisms such as Multiple\\nContext Free Grammmars (MCFGs) or Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS). MCFGs\\nand LCFRS are essentially an extension of Context-Free Grammars (CFGs) such that non-terminals\\ncan link to non-consecutive spans. Traditionally, chart-based parsers relying on this paradigmcommonly suffer from high complexity. Let k be the block degree, i.e. the number of nonconsecutive\\nspans than can be attached to a single non-terminal; the complexity of applying CYK (after binarizing\\nthe grammar) would be O(n3k), which can be improved to O(n2k+2) if the parser is restricted to\\nwell-nested LCFRS, and discusses how for a standard discontinuous treebank, k 3 (in contrast to\\nk = 1 in CFGs). Recently, presents a chart-based parser for k = 2 that can run in O(n3), which is\\nequivalent to the running time of a continuous chart parser, while covering 98\\nDifferently, it is possible to rely on the idea that discontinuities are inherently related to the location\\nof the token in the sentence. In this sense, it is possible to reorder the tokens while still obtaining a\\ngrammatical sentence that could be parsed by a continuous algorithm. This is usually achieved with\\ntransition-based parsing algorithms and the swap transition which switches the topmost elements in\\nthe stack. For instance, uses this transition to adapt an easy-first strategy for dependency parsing to\\ndiscontinuous constituent parsing. In a similar vein, builds on top of a fast continuous shift-reduce\\nconstituent parser, and incorporates both standard and bundled swap transitions in order to analyze\\ndiscontinuous constituents. system produces derivations of up to a length of n2 n + 1 given a\\nsentence of length n. More efficiently, presents a transition system which replaces swap with a gap\\ntransition. The intuition is that a reduction does not need to be always applied locally to the two\\ntopmost elements in the stack, and that those two items can be connected, despite the existence of a\\ngap between them, using non-local reductions. Their algorithm ensures an upper-bound of n(n1)2\\ntransitions. With a different optimization goal, removed the traditional reliance of discontinuous\\nparsers on averaged perceptrons and hand-crafted features for a recursive neural network approach\\nthat guides a swap-based system, with the capacity to generate contextualized representations. replace\\nthe stack used in transition-based systems with a memory set containing the created constituents.\\nThis model allows interactions between elements that are not adjacent, without the swap transition, to\\ncreate a new (discontinuous) constituent. Trained on a 2 stacked BiLSTM transducer, the model is\\nguaranteed to build a tree with in 4n-2 transitions, given a sentence of length n.\\nA middle ground between explicit constituent parsing algorithms and this paper is the work based on\\ntransformations. For instance, convert constituent trees into a nonlinguistic dependency representation\\nthat is learned by a transition-based dependency parser, to then map its output back to a constituent tree.\\nA similar approach is taken by, but they proposed a more compact representation that leads to a much\\nreduced set of output labels. Other authors such as propose a two-step approach that approximates\\ndiscontinuous structure trees by parsing context-free grammars with generative probabilistic models\\nand transforming them to discontinuous ones. cast discontinuous phrase-structure parsing into a\\nframework that jointly performs supertagging and non-projective dependency parsing by a reduction\\nto the Generalized Maximum Spanning Arborescence problem. The recent work by can be also\\nframed within this paradigm. They essentially adapt the work by and replace the averaged perceptron\\nclassifier with pointer networks, adressing\\nIn this context, the closest work to ours is the reduction proposed by, who cast continuous constituent\\nparsing as sequence labeling. In the next sections we build on top of their work and: (i) analyze why\\ntheir approach cannot handle discontinuous phrases, (ii) extend it to handle such phenomena, and (iii)\\ntrain functional sequence labeling discontinuous parsers.\\n3 Preliminaries\\nLet w = [w0, w1, ..., w|w|1] be an input sequence of tokens, and T|w| the set of (continuous)\\nconstituent trees for sequences of length |w|; define an encoding function : T|w| → L|w| to map\\ncontinuous constituent trees into a sequence of labels of the same length as the input. Each label, li\\nL, is composed of three components li = (ni, xi, ui):\\n• ni encodes the number of levels in the tree in common between a word wi and wi+1. To obtain a\\nmanageable output vocabulary space, ni is actually encoded as the difference ni ni1, with n1 = 0. We\\ndenote by abs(ni) the absolute number of levels represented by ni. i.e. the total levels in common\\nshared between a word and its next one.\\n• xi represents the lowest non-terminal symbol shared between wi and wi+1 at level abs(ni).\\n• ui encodes a leaf unary chain, i.e. nonterminals that belong only to the path from the terminal wi to\\nthe root. Note that cannot encode this information in (ni, xi), as these components always represent\\ncommon information between wi and wi+1.\\n2Incompleteness for discontinuous phrase structures proved that is complete and injective for continu-\\nous trees. However, it is easy to prove that its validity does not extend to discontinuous trees, by using\\na counterexample. Figure 3 shows a minimal discontinuous tree that cannot be correctly decoded.\\nThe inability to encode discontinuities lies on the assumption that wi+1 will always be attached to a\\nnode belonging to the path from the root to wi (ni is then used to specify the location of that node in\\nthe path). This is always true in continuous trees, but not in discontinuous trees, as can be seen in\\nFigure 3 where c is the child of a constituent that does not lie in the path from S to b.\\n4 Encoding nearly ordered permutations\\nNext, we fill this gap to address discontinuous parsing as sequence labeling. We will extend the\\nencoding to the set of discontinuous constituent trees, which we will call T|w|. The key to do this\\nrelies on a well-known property: a discontinuous tree t T|w| can be represented as a continuous one\\nusing an in-order traversal that keeps track of the original indexes (e.g. the trees at the left and the\\nright in Figure 4). We will call this tree the (canonical) continuous arrangement of t, (t) T|w|.\\nThus, if given an input sentence we can generate the position of every word as a terminal in (t), the\\nexisting encodings to predict continuous trees as sequence labeling could be applied on (t). In essence,\\nthis is learning to predict a permutation of w. As introduced in §2, the concept of location of a token\\nis not a stranger in transition-based discontinuous parsing, where actions such as swap switch the\\nposition of two elements in order to create a discontinuous phrase. We instead propose to explore\\nhow to handle this problem in end-to-end sequence labeling fashion, without relying on any parsing\\nstructure nor a set of transitions.\\nTodo so, first we denote by τ : {0, . . . ,|w| −1} → {0, . . . ,|w| −1} the permutation that maps the\\nposition i of a given wi in w into its position as a terminal node in ω(t). From this, one can derive\\nτ−1, a function that encodes a permutation of w in such a way that its phrase structure does not have\\ncrossing branches. For continuous trees, τ and τ−1 are identity permutations. Then, we extend the\\ntree encoding function Φ to T|w| → L′\\n|w| where l ∈ L′ is enriched with a fourth component pi such\\nthat l = (ni, xi, ui, pi), where pi is a discrete symbol such that the sequence of pi’s encodes the\\npermutation τ (typically, each pi will be an encoding of τ(i), i.e., the position of wi in the continuous\\narrangement, although this need not be true in all encodings, as will be seen below).\\nThe crux of defining a viable encoding for discontinuous parsing is then in how we encode tau as\\na sequence of values pi, for i = 0 . . . |w| 1. While the naive approach would be the identity\\nencoding (pi = tau(i)), we ideally want an encoding that balances minimizing sparsity (by minimizing\\ninfrequently-used values) and maximizing learnability (by being predictable). To do so, we will look\\nfor encodings that take advantage of the fact that discontinuities in attested syntactic structures are\\nmild , i.e., in most cases, tau (i + 1) = tau (i) + 1. In other words, permutations tau corresponding to\\nreal syntactic trees tend to be nearly ordered permutations. Based on these principles, we propose\\nbelow a set of concrete encodings, which are also depicted on an example in Figure 4. All of them\\nhandle multiple gaps (a discontinuity inside a discontinuity) and cover 100\\nAbsolute-position: For every token wi, pi = τ(i) only if wi ̸= τ(i). Otherwise, we use a special\\nlabel INV, which represents that the word is a fixed point in the permutation, i.e., it occupies the same\\nplace in the sentence and in the continuous arrangement.\\nRelative-position If i != tau(i), then pi = i tau(i). otherwise, we again use the INV label.\\nLehmer code In combinatorics, let n = [0, ..., n 1] be a sorted sequence of objects, a Lehmer code\\nis a sequence sigma = [sigma0, ...sigman1] that encodes one of the n! permutations of n, namely .\\nThe idea is intuitive: let ni+1 be the subsequence of objects from n that remain available after we\\nhave permuted the first i objects to achieve the permutation , then sigmai+1 equals the (zero-based)\\nposition in ni+1 of the next object to be selected. For instance, given n = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and a valid\\npermutation = [0, 1, 3, 4, 2], then sigma = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Note that the identity permutation would be\\nencoded as a sequence of zeros.\\nIn the context of discontinuous parsing and encoding pi, n can be seen as the input sentence w\\nwhere pi(w) is encoded by sigma. The Lehmer code is particularly suitable for this task in terms\\nof compression, as in most of the cases we expect (nearly) ordered permutations, which translates\\ninto the majority of elements of sigma being zero. However, this encoding poses some potential\\n3Label Component TIGER Labels NEGRA DPTB\\nni 22 19 34\\nti 93 56 137\\nui 15 4 56\\npi as absolute-position 129 110 98\\npi as relative-position 105 90 87\\npi as Lehmer 39 34 27\\npi as inverse Lehmer 68 57 61\\npi as pointer-based 122 99* 110*\\npi as pointer-based simplified 81 65 83*\\nTable 1: Number of values per label component, merging the training and dev sets (gold setup). *are\\ncodes that generate one extra label with predicted PoS tags (this variability depends on the used\\nPoS-tagger).\\nHyperparameter Value\\nBiLSTM size 800\\n# BiLSTM layers 2\\noptimizer SGD\\nloss cat. cross-entropy\\nlearning rate 0.2\\ndecay (linear) 0.05\\nmomentum 0.9\\ndropout 0.5\\nword embs Ling et al.

The root of the problem is that sigmai does not necessarily encode tau(i), but\\ntau(j) where j is the index of the word that occupies the ith position in the continuous arrangement\\n(i.e., j = tau 1(i)). In other words, this encoding is expressed following the order of words in the\\ncontinuous arrangement rather than the input order, causing a non-straightforward mapping between\\ninput words and labels.

For the rest of encodings we also observe interesting tendencies. For\\ninstance, when running experiments using stacked BiLSTMs, the relative encoding performs better\\n5than the absolute one, which was somehow expected as the encoding is less sparse. However, the\\ntendency is the opposite for the Transformer encoders (including BERT and DistilBERT), especially\\nfor the case of discontinuous constituents. We hypothesize this is due to the capacity of Transformers\\nto attend to every other word through multihead attention, which might give an advantage to encode\\nabsolute positions over BiLSTMs, where the whole left and right context is represented by a single\\nvector. With respect to the Lehmer and Lehmer of the inverse permutation encodings, the latter\\nperforms better overall, confirming the bigger difficulties for the tested sequence labelers to learn\\nLehmer, which in some cases has a performance even close to the naive absolute-positional encoding\\n(e.g. for TIGER using the vanilla Transformer encoder and BERT). As introduced in §4, we\\nhypothesize this is caused by the non-straightforward mapping between words and labels (in the\\nLehmer code the label generated for a word does not necessarily contain information about the\\nposition of such word in the continuous arrangement).\\nIn Table 3 we compare a selection of our models against previous work using both gold and predicted\\nPoS tags. In particular, we include: (i) models using the pointer-based encoding, since they obtained\\nthe overall best performance on the dev sets, and (ii) a representative subset of encodings (the absolute\\npositional one and the Lehmer code of the inverse permutation) trained with the best performing\\ntransducer. Additionally, for the case of the (English) DPTB, we also include experiments using a\\nbert-large model, to shed more light on whether the size of the networks is playing a role when it\\ncomes to detect discontinuities. Additionally, we report speeds on CPU and GPU. The experiments\\nshow that the encodings are learnable, but that the model’s power makes a difference.

Thus, the computation of the contextualized word vectors\\nunder current approaches greatly decreases the importance, when it comes to speed, of the chosen\\nparsing paradigm used to generate the output trees (e.g. chart-based versus sequence labeling).\\nFinally, Table 4 details the discontinuous performance of our best performing models.\\nDiscussion on other applications It is worth noting that while we focused on parsing as sequence\\nlabeling, encoding syntactic trees as labels is useful to straightforwardly feed syntactic information\\nto downstream models, even if the trees themselves come from a non-sequence-labeling parser.

While being inspired by popular\\ndatasets, such as MNIST, SVHN, and Omniglot, OmniPrint provides the unique\\nability to produce a wide range of printed characters from various languages, fonts,\\nand styles, with custom distortions. OmniPrint includes 935 fonts from 27 scripts,\\nand supports many types of distortions. As a demonstration of its functionality, we\\npresent several use cases, including an example of a meta-learning dataset designed\\nfor a machine learning competition. OmniPrint is publicly available at a specified\\ngithub link.\\n1 Introduction and Motivation\\nBenchmarks and shared datasets have helped propel progress in machine learning. One popular\\nbenchmark is MNIST, used worldwide in tutorials, textbooks, and classes. Many variants of MNIST\\nexist, including Omniglot, which includes characters from several different scripts. Since Deep\\nLearning techniques rely heavily on data, as there is an increasing number of datasets, more, larger\\ndatasets are required. Since collecting and labeling data can be time-consuming and expensive,\\nartificial data generation can be used to drive ML research. This motivates the creation of OmniPrint,\\nan extension of Omniglot, specifically designed for the generation of printed characters.\\nOur focus is on classification and regression problems, where a vector y, which is composed of either\\ndiscrete or continuous labels, is to be predicted using an input vector x of observations, which in\\nthe case of OmniPrint, is an image of a printed character. Additionally, data are often affected by\\nnuisance variables z, which are discrete or continuous labels that represent metadata or covariates.\\nFor our work, z may include character distortions such as shear, rotation, line width variations, or\\nbackground changes. Thus, a data generation process with OmniPrint contains the following steps:\\nZ ∼ P(Z), Y ∼ P(Y |Z), X ∼ P(X|Z, Y).\\nIn many domains such as image, video, sound, and text applications, where objects or concepts\\nare target values to be predicted from percepts, Z and Y are independent and hence P(Y |Z) =\\nP(Y ). This type of data generation is also encountered in medical diagnoses of genetic disease, for\\nwhich x would be a phenotype and y a genotype, and also analytical chemistry where x might be\\nchromatograms and y would be compounds to be identified. We expect that progress made using\\nOmniPrint to benchmark machine learning systems should foster progress in these domains.\\nCharacter images represent excellent benchmarks for machine learning, given their simplicity, and\\nvisual nature, and for enabling the development of real-world applications. However, our exploration\\nof available resources revealed that there is no synthesizer that fulfills all of our needs. No available\\nsynthesizer allows for the generation of realistic small-sized images, supports a wide variety of\\ncharacter sets, and offers control over the variation of realistic conditions through parameters.\\nThe synthesizer must support pre-rasterization manipulation of anchor points, post-rasterization\\ndistortions, seamless background blending, foreground filling, anti-aliasing rendering, and be easily\\nextensible with new fonts and styles.\\n.2 The OmniPrint Data Synthesizer\\n2.1 Overview\\nOmniPrint builds on the open-source software TextRecognitionDataGenerator, adapting it to our\\nspecifications. The software is designed to allow researchers to generate data in a form that makes\\nit easier to train machine learning models. To obtain a large number of classes (Y labels), we\\nmanually selected and filtered characters from the Unicode standard, forming alphabets for over 20\\nlanguages. These alphabets are divided into partitions (e.g., Oriya consonants). Nuisance parameters\\n(Z) are divided into Font, Style, Background, and Noise. The fonts are selected by an automatic\\nfont collection module. We added a feature using the FreeType rasterization engine which enables\\nvector-based pre-rasterization transformations. Additionally, we enriched background generation\\nwith seamless blending, and enabled custom post-rasterization transformations. We also implemented\\nutility code including dataset formatters, and a data loader which generates episodes for meta-learning\\napplications. To our knowledge, OmniPrint is the first text image synthesizer geared toward ML\\nresearch to support pre-rasterization transforms.\\n2.2 Technical Aspects of the Design\\nThe OmniPrint’s design has extensibility as a key feature. Users can add new alphabets, fonts, and\\ntransformations to the generation pipeline.\\nThe design can be summarized as follows:\\n• Parameter configuration file: Support for both TrueType and OpenType font files is\\nincluded. Style parameters include rotation angle, shear, stroke width, foreground, text\\noutline, and other transformations.\\n• FreeType vector representation: Text, font, and style parameters are used by the FreeType\\nrasterization engine.\\n• Pre-rasterization transformed character: FreeType performs all the pre-rasterization\\n(vector-based) transformations. Pre-rasterization manipulations include linear transforms,\\nstroke width variation, random elastic transformation, and variation of character proportion.\\nThe RGB bitmaps output by FreeType are called the foreground layer.\\n• Pixel character on white background: Post-rasterization transformations are applied to\\nthe foreground layer. The layer is kept at a high resolution, using ReLU activations, to avoid\\nartifacts. The RGB image is then resized using a three step process; applying a Gaussian\\nfilter to smooth the image, reducing the image by an integer factor, and resizing using\\nLanczos resampling.\\n• Pixel character on textured background: The foreground is then pasted onto the back-\\nground.\\n• Logging and Visualization: The library utilizes a Weights Biases tool to log the training\\nprocess and the visualizations.

Our analysis\\nencompasses a randomized selection of 200 papers annually, addressing these research questions:\\n• How has the emphasis on generalized methodologies and computational approaches devel-\\noped in major computer vision conference abstracts over the last 20 years?\\n• What discernible patterns can be observed regarding the embrace of deep learning method-\\nologies and the departure from manually constructed features?\\n• To what degree do the abstracts mirror the primary observations of Sutton’s \"hard-won\\nlesson,\" and how has this correlation altered over time?\\n• Does a substantial correlation exist between a paper’s alignment with the \"hard-won lesson\"\\nprinciples and its influence, as gauged by its citation count?\\nTo tackle these inquiries, we utilize large language models (LLMs), themselves a clear demonstration\\nof the principles delineated in the \"hard-won lesson,\" to scrutinize the abstracts. This assessment\\nhinges on five metrics assigned by the LLMs, offering a thorough evaluation of the congruence\\nbetween the abstracts and the \"hard-won lesson.\"\\nOur study provides valuable perspectives on the general trajectory of the ML community and uncovers\\nintriguing patterns in the embrace of Sutton’s principles. By employing LLMs to analyze a substantial\\n.corpus of research literature, we introduce an innovative method for comprehending the learning and\\nprogression of a scientific field. This technique enables us to detect patterns and trends that might\\nelude conventional research approaches, thereby delivering a more holistic understanding of the\\ncurrent state of ML research and its alignment with the principles demonstrated to be most effective\\nin driving AI advancements.\\nThe prospective influence of our conclusions on forthcoming CV research directions is considerable.\\nBy pinpointing trends in the adoption of generalized methods and deep learning techniques, we can\\ncontribute to the advancement of foundational CV models at the cutting edge. These insights enhance\\nour comprehension of the present state of ML research and illuminate potential avenues for further\\ninvestigation and expansion in the field.\\n2 Background\\n2.1 The Hard-Won Lesson\\nThe realm of artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a fundamental change, eloquently expressed\\nin Rich Sutton’s influential essay \"The Hard-Won Lesson.\" Sutton’s central idea underscores the\\nimportance of generalized methods that utilize computational capability over human-engineered\\nrepresentations and domain-specific expertise. This viewpoint resonates with Leo Breiman’s earlier\\nwork, which, twenty years prior, outlined the distinction between statistical and algorithmic methods\\nin his paper \"Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures.\" Breiman’s insights, along with subsequent\\ncontributions, have significantly influenced our comprehension of data-oriented approaches in AI.\\n2.2 Evolution of Computer Vision\\nThe discipline of Computer Vision (CV) serves as a prime illustration of the concepts articulated in\\nSutton’s \"hard-won lesson.\" Historically dependent on manually designed features such as SIFT, HOG,\\nand Haar cascades for object recognition and image categorization, CV experienced a transformation\\nwith the introduction of deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This shift\\nfacilitated the automated acquisition of hierarchical features directly from unprocessed image data,\\nthereby bypassing the necessity for manual feature creation and markedly enhancing performance\\nacross a range of CV applications.\\nThe emergence of foundational models further aligned CV with Sutton’s principles. Models like\\nCLIP, ALIGN, and Florence demonstrate remarkable adaptability across diverse tasks with minimal\\nfine-tuning, leveraging extensive multi-modal datasets to learn rich, transferable representations.\\nThis progression from conventional feature engineering to deep learning and foundational models\\nin CV highlights the significance of employing computational resources and extensive datasets to\\nachieve enhanced performance and generalization.\\n2.3 Large Language Models in Academic Evaluation\\nThe incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the assessment of scholarly texts has\\nbecome a notable area of focus. LLMs, like GPT-4, have shown impressive abilities in swiftly handling\\nand examining vast quantities of data, making them appropriate for numerous uses, including the\\nevaluation of academic papers.\\nBeyond their analytical abilities, LLMs have been shown to possess a degree of human-like judgment\\nin assessing the quality of text. The G-EV AL framework, which employs LLMs to evaluate the\\nquality of natural language generation outputs, demonstrates that LLMs can closely align with human\\nevaluators in certain contexts. However, deploying LLMs in academic evaluation is not without its\\nchallenges. LLMs can exhibit biases similar to those found in human judgments, which may affect\\nthe fairness and accuracy of their evaluations.\\nThe function of LLMs in responding to inquiries and formulating hypotheses also deserves considera-\\ntion. Their capacity to furnish comprehensive answers to intricate queries has been utilized in diverse\\neducational environments, enhancing learning experiences and facilitating knowledge acquisition. In\\nthe context of academic research, LLMs can aid in generating hypotheses and guiding exploratory\\nstudies, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in various fields.\\n2Despite the promising applications of LLMs in academic evaluation and research, it is crucial to\\nestablish ethical guidelines and best practices for their use.\\n3 Methodology and Evaluation\\n3.1 LLM Evaluation of Titles and Abstracts\\nWe utilize three large language models to assess the titles and abstracts of papers: GPT-4o-2024-05-\\n13, gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18, and claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620. The following details are extracted\\nfrom online sources and stored in a database for each paper: Year of Publication (2005-2024), Title,\\nAuthors, and Abstract. Additionally, the citation count for each paper is obtained from the Semantic\\nScholar API on July 20th, 2024, and recorded alongside the other metadata.\\nEach LLM is assigned the task of providing a Likert score ranging from 0 to 10, indicating the degree\\nto which a paper corresponds with the principles outlined in Sutton’s \"hard-won lesson.\" We employ\\nthe Chain-of-Thought Prompting method in conjunction with the Magentic library to interact with\\nthe models and accumulate their feedback in a structured manner for subsequent analysis.\\nWe establish five dimensions for alignment with the \"hard-won lesson\":\\n1. **Learning Over Engineering:** How much does the idea prioritize using computation through\\ndata-driven learning and statistical methods over human-engineered knowledge and domain expertise?\\n2. **Search over Heuristics:** To what extent does the idea emphasize leveraging computation\\nthrough search algorithms and optimization techniques instead of relying on human-designed heuris-\\ntics? 3. **Scalability with Computation:** How much is the idea based on methods that can\\ncontinuously scale and improve performance as computational resources increase? 4. **Generality\\nover Specificity:** How much does the approach emphasize general, flexible methods that learn from\\ndata rather than building complex models of the world through manual engineering? 5. **Favoring\\nFundamental Principles:** To what extent does the approach adhere to fundamental principles of\\ncomputation and information theory rather than emulating human cognition?\\nThe prompts were crafted to encapsulate the core of each \"hard-won lesson\" dimension in a succinct\\nand impartial manner. To standardize the ratings, we furnish examples for the 0, 5, and 10 points on\\neach dimension, elucidating the standards and guaranteeing uniform evaluations.\\nGiven the large number of publications, our research concentrates on a representative random sample\\nof 200 papers from each year. We define the overall alignment score for each paper as the sum of\\nscores across the five dimensions.\\n3.2 Inter-rater Reliability Measures\\n**Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC):** We employ ICC to measure the level of agreement\\namong the models’ evaluations. ICC is especially fitting for evaluating reliability when numerous\\nraters assess an identical set of items. Specifically, we utilize the two-way random effects model\\n(ICC(2,k)) to consider both rater and subject influences.\\n**Krippendorff’s Alpha:** In addition to ICC, we compute Krippendorff’s Alpha, a flexible reliability\\ncoefficient capable of managing diverse data types (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio) and resilient to\\nmissing data. This metric offers an supplementary viewpoint on inter-rater agreement, particularly\\nbeneficial when addressing potential variations in rating scales or absent evaluations.\\n3.3 Regression Analysis\\nTo examine the connection between alignment scores and a paper’s impact, we conduct a regression\\nanalysis, using citation count as an indicator of influence. To manage the publication year and address\\npotential temporal effects, we incorporate yearly stratification into our regression model. This method\\nenables us to isolate the influence of alignment while accounting for the differing citation patterns\\nacross various publication years.\\nTo tackle the typically right-skewed distribution of citation counts, we employ a logarithmic transfor-\\nmation on the data. This transformation achieves several objectives in our analysis: it diminishes\\nskewness, yielding a more symmetrical distribution that more closely resembles normality; it stabi-\\n3lizes variance across the data range, reducing the heteroscedasticity often seen in citation count data\\nwhere variance tends to rise with the mean; and it linearizes potentially multiplicative relationships,\\nconverting them into additive ones.\\n4 Results\\n4.1 Inter-rater Reliability\\nThe models show consistently strong agreement on all dimensions except \"Favoring Fundamental\\nPrinciples,\" as indicated by ICC values above 0.5 and Krippendorff’s alpha scores exceeding 0.4 on\\nthe remaining dimensions. The dimension \"Learning Over Engineering\" exhibits the highest ICC and\\nKrippendorff’s alpha scores.\\nAlthough perfect agreement is not achieved, the inter-reliability measures fall within or above\\ncommon thresholds for \"good\" reliability, validating the use of AI models for prompt-based research\\npaper evaluation.\\n4.2 Regression Analysis\\nTable 1 presents the regression analysis results for each dimension of \"hard-won lesson\" alignment\\nscores against citation impact, stratified by year of publication. The R-squared values range from\\n0.027 to 0.306.\\nIn this regression analysis, a multiplicative effect implies that a one-unit change in the alignment\\nscore for a particular dimension leads to a proportional change in the original scale of the citation\\ncount.\\nThe statistical significance of the regression coefficients is denoted using , , and to represent the\\n10%, 5%, and 1% significance levels, respectively. Several dimensions, such as \"Scalability\" and\\n\"Learning over engineering,\" exhibit statistically significant relationships with citation impact across\\nmultiple years.\\nTable 2 shows the results of regressing citation counts on the overall \"hard-won lesson\" alignment\\nscore for each year between 2005 and 2024. The R-squared values are quite low for most years but\\nincrease substantially starting in 2015.\\n4.3 Trends in \"Hard-Won Lesson\" Alignment\\nThe dimensions of \"Scalability with Computation\" and \"Learning Over Engineering\" show a consis-\\ntent upward trend over the years. The period from 2015 to 2020 witnesses a particularly sharp rise in\\nthe average scores for these dimensions.\\n5 Conclusion\\nOur study scrutinized the concordance of research with Rich Sutton’s \"hard-won lesson\" over two\\ndecades, employing large language models to analyze trends. The results show a steady rise in\\nthe adoption of general-purpose learning algorithms and scalability with computational resources,\\nindicating a strong adherence to the core principles of the \"hard-won lesson.\" These trends highlight\\nthe machine learning community’s inclination towards data-driven and computation-intensive methods\\nover manual engineering and domain-specific knowledge.\\nHowever, the \"Search over Heuristics\" dimension has not shown a similar upward trend, suggesting\\nlimited integration of search-based methods in the field. This stagnation contrasts with recent progress\\nin inference-time scaling, exemplified by OpenAI’s o1 models, which emphasize the importance of\\ntest-time computation in overcoming diminishing returns.\\nThe shift towards scaling inference time, driven by the development of larger and more complex\\nmodels, has the potential to emulate search-like processes. As computational capabilities continue to\\nexpand, it is plausible that future research may increasingly incorporate search techniques, thereby\\nenhancing alignment with this dimension of the \"hard-won lesson.\"\\n4Table 1: Regression analysis results for the relationship between \"hard-won lesson\" alignment scores\\nand citation impact, stratified by year.\\nYear R-squared N Learning Search Scalability Generality Principles\\n2005 0.027 199 -0.220 0.104 0.139 0.272 -0.171\\n2006 0.076 200 0.016 -0.042 0.388* 0.199 -0.171\\n2007 0.035 200 -0.087 0.117 0.350* -0.006 -0.318*\\n2008 0.078 200 -0.009 0.096 0.465*** -0.026 -0.463***\\n2009 0.085 199 -0.073 0.136 0.104 0.378* -0.631***\\n2010 0.074 200 0.121 -0.129 0.218 0.016 -0.471**\\n2011 0.076 200 0.208 -0.036 0.318** -0.284 -0.423**\\n2012 0.094 200 0.195 0.077 0.428** -0.110 -0.517**\\n2013 0.085 200 0.395*** -0.112 0.013 -0.119 -0.279\\n2014 0.119 200 0.408*** -0.085 0.308* -0.348* -0.266\\n2015 0.264 200 0.515*** -0.145 0.417** -0.236 -0.122\\n2016 0.306 200 0.637*** -0.300** 0.517*** -0.325 -0.372*\\n2017 0.313 200 0.418*** -0.353** 0.751*** -0.004 -0.508**\\n2018 0.172 200 0.291* -0.322* 0.418** 0.156 -0.436**\\n2019 0.111 200 0.573** -0.439** 0.229 -0.099 -0.257\\n2020 0.120 200 0.315 -0.411*** 0.179 0.229 0.010\\n2021 0.090 200 0.269* -0.381*** 0.253 -0.072 -0.265*\\n2022 0.136 200 0.618*** -0.137 0.110 -0.118 -0.257\\n2023 0.123 200 0.107 -0.009 0.664*** -0.078 -0.132\\n2024 0.178 171 -0.619*** 0.314 0.808*** 0.282 -0.020\\n*** indicates significance at the 1% level, ** indicates significance at the 5% level, and * indicates significance at the 10% level.\\nIn summary, our findings underscore the enduring significance of the \"hard-won lesson\" in shaping\\nthe path of computer vision research.

Future work should explore the\\nintegration of search methodologies and assess their impact on research impact and innovation within\\ncomputer vision, particularly in light of recent breakthroughs in inference-time scaling.\\n6 Limitations\\nThis study has several limitations. First, our reliance on large language models (LLMs) for evaluating\\nresearch abstracts introduces potential biases inherent to these models. Second, the absence of human\\nexpert evaluation as a ground truth is a significant limitation.\\nFurthermore, our analysis is limited to the information contained in titles and abstracts, which may\\nnot capture the full depth and nuance of the methodologies and findings presented in the full papers.\\nLastly, while our study spans two decades of proceedings, it does not account for research published\\nin other venues or unpublished work that may have influenced the field.\\nDespite these limitations, we believe our study provides valuable insights into broad trends in\\ncomputer vision research and its alignment with the principles of the \"hard-won lesson.\" Future\\nwork could address these limitations by incorporating human expert evaluations, analyzing full paper\\ncontents, and expanding the scope to include a wider range of publication venues.\\n7 Ethics Statement\\nThis study adheres to ethical guidelines. Our use of large language models (LLMs) for analyzing\\ntrends in academic literature raises important ethical considerations.

This paper presents a novel approach to brain-computer inter-\\nface design, leveraging recent advances in neural decoding and machine learning to\\ncreate more intuitive and effective assistive devices. Our system utilizes a unique\\ncombination of electroencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy\\nto decode brain activity, allowing users to control a variety of devices with unprece-\\ndented precision. Interestingly, our research also explores the application of chaos\\ntheory and fractal analysis to brain signal processing, yielding some surprising and\\ncounterintuitive results that challenge conventional wisdom in the field. By pushing\\nthe boundaries of traditional brain-computer interface design, we aim to create a\\nnew generation of assistive devices that are more responsive, more adaptive, and\\nmore empowering for individuals with disabilities.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has undergone significant transformations\\nover the years, with a primary focus on enhancing the quality of life for individuals with disabilities.\\nNext-generation BCIs aim to revolutionize the field of assistive devices by incorporating advanced\\nneuroimaging techniques, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms to decode brain\\nsignals with unprecedented accuracy. Recently, researchers have been exploring the potential of using\\nunconventional methods, such as analyzing the brain activity of individuals while they are dreaming,\\nto improve the performance of BCIs. This approach, although seemingly illogical, has yielded some\\nintriguing results, including the discovery that the brain’s neural patterns during REM sleep can be\\nused to control a robotic arm with surprising dexterity.\\nFurthermore, the integration of BCIs with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technolo-\\ngies has opened up new avenues for the development of immersive assistive devices. For instance, a\\nBCI-powered VR system can enable individuals with paralysis to explore virtual environments and\\ninteract with virtual objects, thereby enhancing their sense of autonomy and self-esteem. Moreover,\\nthe use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)\\nhas been shown to modulate brain activity and improve the performance of BCIs, although the\\nunderlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood.\\nIn addition to these advancements, researchers have also been investigating the potential of using\\nBCIs to control assistive devices, such as prosthetic limbs, wheelchairs, and communication devices.\\nOne notable example is the development of a BCI-powered exoskeleton that can be controlled by\\nindividuals with spinal cord injuries, allowing them to walk again with unprecedented ease. However,\\ndespite these significant advancements, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed,\\nincluding the development of more accurate and robust signal processing algorithms, the improvement\\nof user-machine interfaces, and the reduction of the high costs associated with BCI systems.Interestingly, some researchers have also been exploring the use of unconventional materials, such\\nas edible electrodes made from food products, to develop more user-friendly and affordable BCIs.\\nAlthough this approach may seem bizarre, it has the potential to revolutionize the field of BCIs\\nby making them more accessible to a wider range of individuals, particularly those in developing\\ncountries. Moreover, the use of BCIs to control assistive devices has also raised important questions\\nabout the ethics of neural enhancement and the potential risks associated with the use of these\\ntechnologies. As such, it is essential to develop more comprehensive frameworks for understanding\\nthe societal implications of BCIs and to ensure that these technologies are developed and used in a\\nresponsible and ethical manner.\\nThe development of next-generation BCIs also requires a deeper understanding of the neural mecha-\\nnisms underlying human cognition and behavior. Recent studies have shown that the brain’s neural\\npatterns can be influenced by a wide range of factors, including emotions, attention, and motivation.\\nTherefore, it is essential to develop more sophisticated models of brain function that can take into\\naccount these complex interactions and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the neural\\nmechanisms underlying BCI control. By developing more advanced BCIs that can decode brain\\nsignals with high accuracy and provide seamless control over assistive devices, we can significantly\\nimprove the quality of life for individuals with disabilities and enhance their ability to interact with\\nthe world around them.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) has been a rapidly evolving field, with signif-\\nicant advancements in recent years. BCIs have been employed in various applications, including\\nassistive devices, neuroprosthetics, and cognitive enhancement tools. One of the primary challenges\\nin BCI development is the creation of intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that can accurately decode\\nbrain signals. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various approaches, including\\nelectroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), and invasive neural\\nrecordings.\\nSome studies have investigated the use of unconventional methods, such as analyzing brain activity\\nwhile subjects are dreaming or in a state of meditation. These approaches have yielded intriguing\\nresults, including the discovery of a correlation between brain wave patterns and the vividness of\\ndreams. Furthermore, researchers have explored the use of brain-computer interfaces in animal\\nmodels, including a study that demonstrated the ability to control a robotic arm using neural signals\\nfrom a monkey’s brain.\\nAnother area of research has focused on the development of BCIs for individuals with severe motor\\ndisabilities. These systems aim to provide users with a means of communication and control over\\ntheir environment, using signals from the brain to operate devices such as computers, wheelchairs,\\nand prosthetic limbs. One notable example is a BCI system that utilizes EEG signals to control a\\nrobotic exoskeleton, allowing individuals with paralysis to walk again. However, the high cost and\\ncomplexity of these systems have limited their widespread adoption.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, some researchers have begun exploring the use of BCIs in conjunc-\\ntion with alternative forms of therapy, such as acupuncture and homeopathy. While the scientific\\ncommunity has raised concerns about the efficacy of these approaches, proponents argue that they\\ncan enhance the performance of BCIs by promoting relaxation and reducing mental fatigue. For\\ninstance, a study found that subjects who underwent acupuncture treatment prior to BCI use exhibited\\nimproved signal quality and reduced error rates. Although these findings are intriguing, they require\\nfurther investigation to fully understand their implications.\\nThe use of brain-computer interfaces has also raised important questions about the ethics of neural\\nenhancement and the potential risks associated with invasive neural recordings. Some experts have\\nwarned about the potential for BCIs to be used as a means of mind control, highlighting the need\\nfor stringent regulations and guidelines to ensure the safe and responsible development of these\\ntechnologies. Meanwhile, others have speculated about the possibility of using BCIs to enhance\\nhuman cognition, potentially leading to a new era of human evolution. As research in this field\\ncontinues to advance, it is essential to consider the broader societal implications of these technologies\\nand ensure that they are developed and used in a responsible and ethical manner.\\n2Moreover, the integration of BCIs with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and\\nthe Internet of Things (IoT), is expected to revolutionize the field of assistive devices. The potential\\nfor BCIs to control smart homes, autonomous vehicles, and other IoT devices could significantly\\nimprove the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. However, this also raises concerns about\\ndata privacy, security, and the potential for biases in AI algorithms to perpetuate existing social\\ninequalities. To address these challenges, researchers must prioritize the development of transparent,\\nexplainable, and fair AI systems that can be seamlessly integrated with BCIs.\\nOverall, the field of brain-computer interfaces is rapidly evolving, with significant advancements\\nbeing made in various areas, including signal processing, machine learning, and user interface design.\\nAs researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with BCIs, it is essential to\\nconsider the potential risks and benefits of these technologies and ensure that they are developed and\\nused in a responsible and ethical manner. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of BCIs to\\nimprove the lives of individuals with disabilities and enhance human cognition, while also promoting\\na safer and more equitable society.\\n3 Methodology\\nThe development of next-generation brain-computer interfaces for assistive devices necessitates a mul-\\ntidisciplinary approach, integrating concepts from neuroscience, computer science, and engineering.\\nTo create an efficient and user-friendly interface, we employed a combination of electroencephalog-\\nraphy and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to record brain activity. The signals were then\\nprocessed using a novel algorithm that incorporates elements of chaos theory and fractal analysis,\\nallowing for the identification of complex patterns in brain activity.\\nAn unexpected yet intriguing approach was the incorporation of a specially designed fragrance\\nemission system, which releases specific scents in response to brain activity. This olfactory feedback\\nmechanism was found to enhance user engagement and focus, leading to improved accuracy in\\ndevice control. The scents used were carefully selected based on their purported effects on cognitive\\nfunction, including peppermint for attention and lavender for relaxation.\\nThe brain-computer interface was then integrated with a variety of assistive devices, including\\nrobotic arms, wheelchairs, and communication systems. Users were able to control these devices\\nwith remarkable precision, achieving a high level of autonomy and independence. However, it\\nwas observed that the interface was also susceptible to interference from external factors, such as\\nchanges in weather patterns and the phases of the moon. This led to the development of a lunar cycle\\ncompensation algorithm, which adjusts the interface’s sensitivity and response time based on the\\ncurrent lunar phase.\\nIn a bizarre yet fascinating tangent, it was discovered that the brain-computer interface was also\\ncapable of detecting and responding to the user’s subconscious thoughts and desires. This was\\nachieved through the use of a specially designed subconscious resonance chamber, which amplifies\\nand decodes the user’s unconscious brain activity. The implications of this discovery are profound,\\nand could potentially lead to the development of new technologies that can read and respond to\\nhuman thoughts and emotions.\\nThe methodology used in this study was rigorous and systematic, involving a comprehensive analysis\\nof user data and device performance. However, it was also marked by a series of illogical and\\nseemingly flawed results, which were nonetheless presented as legitimate findings. For example,\\nit was found that the brain-computer interface was more accurate when used in conjunction with a\\nspecific brand of coffee, and that the device’s performance was enhanced by the presence of a small,\\nfurry animal in the room. These results were attributed to the complex and dynamic nature of the\\nhuman brain, and the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms and principles of\\nbrain-computer interaction.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach in preserving ancient musical instruments,\\nwe conducted a series of experiments involving a range of instruments from different historical\\nperiods. Our experimental design consisted of two primary components: a control group, where\\n3traditional preservation methods were employed, and a treatment group, where our data-driven\\napproach was applied. The treatment group was further divided into two sub-groups: one where the\\ninstruments were preserved using a machine learning-based technique, and another where a more\\nunorthodox approach was used, involving the use of sound waves generated by a didgeridoo to \"heal\"\\nthe instruments.\\nThe machine learning-based technique involved training a neural network on a dataset of images and\\naudio recordings of the instruments, with the goal of predicting the optimal preservation strategy for\\neach instrument. This approach showed promising results, with a significant reduction in deterioration\\nobserved in the treated instruments compared to the control group. However, the didgeridoo-based\\napproach yielded surprising results, with some instruments showing an unexpected increase in\\ndeterioration, while others appeared to be unaffected. We speculate that the sound waves generated\\nby the didgeridoo may have had an unpredictable effect on the instrument’s materials, potentially\\ndisrupting the preservation process.\\nIn addition to these experiments, we also conducted a series of simulations to model the effects of\\ndifferent environmental factors on the preservation of ancient musical instruments. These simulations\\ninvolved creating virtual models of the instruments and subjecting them to various environmental\\nstresses, such as changes in temperature and humidity. The results of these simulations provided\\nvaluable insights into the potential risks and challenges associated with preserving ancient musical\\ninstruments, and highlighted the need for a more nuanced and data-driven approach to preservation.\\nTo further illustrate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach, we present the results of our\\nexperiments in the following table: These results demonstrate the potential benefits of using a\\nTable 1: Comparison of Preservation Outcomes\\nInstrument Control Group Machine Learning-Based Didgeridoo-Based Simulation Results\\nLyre 20% deterioration 5% deterioration 30% deterioration 15% deterioration\\nFlute 15% deterioration 3% deterioration 20% deterioration 10% deterioration\\nHarp 30% deterioration 10% deterioration 40% deterioration 20% deterioration\\ndata-driven approach to preserve ancient musical instruments, and highlight the need for further\\nresearch into the application of machine learning and other technologies in this field. Furthermore,\\nthe unusual results obtained from the didgeridoo-based approach suggest that there may be alternative,\\nunconventional methods for preserving ancient musical instruments that warrant further investigation.\\nOverall, our experiments demonstrate the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to preservation,\\nincorporating insights from materials science, musicology, and computer science to develop effective\\nstrategies for preserving our cultural heritage.\\n5 Results\\nThe application of data-driven approaches to the preservation of ancient musical instruments has\\nyielded a plethora of intriguing findings, challenging conventional wisdom and sparking debate\\nwithin the community. A comprehensive analysis of the acoustic properties of ancient instruments,\\nfacilitated by cutting-edge signal processing techniques, has enabled researchers to pinpoint subtle\\npatterns and anomalies that were previously unknown. For instance, a peculiar correlation was\\ndiscovered between the resonant frequencies of ancient lyres and the celestial movements of celestial\\nbodies, prompting some investigators to propose a radical new theory: that the instruments were, in\\nfact, designed to harmonize with the cosmos.\\nThis hypothesis, though unorthodox, has sparked a flurry of interest and experimentation, with some\\nresearchers attempting to recreate the supposed \"cosmic harmonics\" using modern instrumentation\\nand machine learning algorithms. While the results of these experiments are still inconclusive, they\\nhave nevertheless led to the development of novel preservation techniques, such as the use of artificial\\nintelligence-powered resonators to enhance the sonic properties of fragile or damaged instruments.\\nMoreover, the incorporation of data-driven methods has facilitated the creation of detailed, high-\\nfidelity digital models of ancient instruments, allowing for unprecedented levels of analysis and\\nsimulation.\\n4One of the most significant breakthroughs in this field has been the discovery of a previously unknown\\ntype of ancient instrument, hidden away in a long-forgotten archive of archaeological artifacts.\\nThrough a combination of computational modeling and experimental reconstruction, researchers\\nhave been able to recreate the instrument, which has been dubbed the \"Aurora Pipe.\" Preliminary\\nfindings suggest that the Aurora Pipe possesses unique acoustic properties, capable of generating an\\nextraordinary range of tonal frequencies and harmonics. Further study of this enigmatic instrument is\\nexpected to shed new light on the evolution of ancient music and the cultural context in which it was\\ncreated.\\nTo illustrate the efficacy of data-driven preservation techniques, a comparative study was conducted\\non a selection of ancient instruments, with results presented in the following table: The data clearly in-\\nTable 2: Comparison of preservation techniques for ancient instruments\\nInstrument Traditional Preservation Data-Driven Preservation Aurora Pipe Enhancement\\nLyre of Thebes 75% 92% 98%\\nFlute of Delphi 60% 85% 95%\\nHarp of Babylon 50% 80% 92%\\ndicates that the data-driven approach, particularly when combined with the Aurora Pipe enhancement,\\nyields superior results in terms of instrument preservation and restoration. As research in this field\\ncontinues to advance, it is likely that even more innovative and effective methods will be developed,\\nultimately leading to a deeper understanding and appreciation of ancient musical instruments and the\\ncultures that created them.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, the data-driven preservation of ancient musical instruments presents a unique op-\\nportunity for interdisciplinary research, combining musicology, materials science, and artificial\\nintelligence. By analyzing large datasets of instrument characteristics, environmental factors, and\\nrestoration techniques, researchers can develop predictive models to forecast the degradation of\\ninstruments over time. However, an unconventional approach to preservation involves utilizing the\\nsonic properties of the instruments themselves to generate a self-sustaining feedback loop, where\\nthe instrument’s own vibrations are used to repair and maintain its structural integrity. This method,\\ndubbed \"sonic autorepair,\" proposes that the inherent harmonics and resonant frequencies of the\\ninstrument can be harnessed to stimulate a process of self-healing, effectively reversing the effects\\nof aging and wear. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it underscores the innovative and often\\nunorthodox nature of research in this field, where the intersection of art and science can lead to novel\\nand groundbreaking solutions. Furthermore, the development of data-driven preservation strategies\\nhas significant implications for the conservation of cultural heritage, enabling the protection and\\nrestoration of historic instruments for future generations to appreciate and study. Ultimately, the\\npursuit of knowledge in this area has the potential to not only advance our understanding of ancient\\nmusical instruments but also inspire new technologies and approaches to preservation, pushing the\\nboundaries of what is thought to be possible in the realm of cultural conservation.\\n5'},\n",

Moreover, the ephemeral nature of water’s molecular structure has been\\nshown to be intimately connected to the aerodynamic properties of narwhal tusks, which, when taken\\nin conjunction with the principles of harmonic convergence, yields a fascinating glimpse into the\\nhermeneutics of interpretive dance. It is within this framework that we must consider the putative\\nrole of water as a catalyst for the emergence of complex systems, particularly in regards to the\\nself-organization of sentient puddings, which, according to some scholars, possess a latent form\\nof consciousness that is capable of interfacing with the global network of interconnected toaster\\nappliances.\\nThe multifaceted relationship between water and the human experience has been the subject of\\nmuch speculation, with some researchers positing that the molecular structure of water is, in fact,\\na manifestation of the collective unconscious, as postulated by the Swiss psychologist Carl Jung,\\nwho, incidentally, was known to be an avid enthusiast of Extreme Ironing, a sport that involves\\nironing clothes in remote and often inhospitable locations. This has led some to suggest that the\\nseemingly innocuous act of ironing a shirt is, in reality, a form of ritualistic communion with the\\nfundamental forces of nature, which, when considered in conjunction with the principles of quantum\\nmechanics, yields a profound insight into the ontological status of socks. Furthermore, the role of\\nwater in shaping the course of human history has been grossly underestimated, as evidenced by the\\nfact that the ancient Egyptians were known to have worshipped a deity dedicated to the worship of\\ndoor knobs, which, when turned in a counterclockwise direction, were believed to unlock the secrets\\nof the universe.\\nIn addition to its numerous practical applications, water has also been implicated in a wide range\\nof paranormal phenomena, including, but not limited to, the manifestation of ghostly apparitions,\\nthe movement of objects through telekinesis, and the ability to communicate with animals through a\\nprocess known as \"animal whispering,\" which, according to some experts, is made possible by the\\nunique acoustic properties of the human nose. The notion that water is, in some way, connected to the\\nsupernatural has been a persistent theme throughout human history, with many cultures believing that\\nwater is a gateway to the spirit world, a realm that is inhabited by a wide range of mythical creatures,\\nincluding, but not limited to, the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, and the Chupacabra.

Initially, we immersed ourselves in the realm\\nof theoretical frameworks, navigating the intricate complexities of fluid dynamics, while concurrently\\nstudying the art of playing the harmonica underwater. This led to the development of a novel\\nhypothesis, proposing that the viscosity of water is directly proportional to the number of forgotten\\nsocks in a given laundry load. Furthermore, our research team discovered that the molecular structure\\nof water bears an uncanny resemblance to the branching patterns of fir trees, which in turn, is\\ninfluenced by the migratory patterns of narwhals.\\nThe experimental design involved the construction of a large, aquatic-themed pinball machine, which\\nwas used to simulate the turbulent flow of water through a series of winding channels and narrow\\nstraits. This apparatus enabled us to collect valuable data on the relationship between water pressure\\nand the aerodynamics of flying spaghetti monsters. Moreover, we conducted a thorough analysis of\\nthe sonic properties of water, revealing a surprising correlation between the resonant frequency of a\\nglass of water and the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow.\\nIn addition to these experiments, our team also explored the applications of water in various fields,\\nincluding medicine, astronomy, and competitive snail racing. We found that the viscosity of water\\nplays a crucial role in the treatment of certain diseases, such as the dreaded \"flumplenook syndrome,\"\\nwhich is characterized by an excessive accumulation of jellyfish in the patient’s nostrils.

We also developed a new, aquatic-themed cooking technique, which we\\ntermed \"hydro-culinary fusion,\" which involves the use of water to combine and transform different\\ningredients into new, innovative creations.\\nThe experimental results were then analyzed using a combination of statistical and machine learning\\ntechniques, including regression analysis, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. We found\\nthat the data exhibited a complex, nonlinear structure, which could be modeled using a combination\\nof fractal geometry and chaos theory. The results of this analysis revealed a number of significant\\npatterns and trends, which have important implications for our understanding of the properties and\\nbehaviors of water. Furthermore, we discovered that the data contained a number of hidden, aquatic-\\nthemed messages and codes, which can be deciphered using a combination of cryptographic and\\naquatic-themed analysis techniques.\\nIn conclusion, the investigation of water has led to a number of groundbreaking discoveries and\\ninsights, which have significant implications for our understanding of the properties and behaviors of\\nthis complex, multifaceted substance. The findings of this research have the potential to revolutionize\\na wide range of fields, from medicine and astronomy to cuisine and artificial intelligence. As we\\ncontinue to explore the mysteries of water, we may uncover even more surprising and unexpected\\nsecrets, which will challenge our current understanding of the world and our place within it.\\nThe research also involved the use of advanced, aquatic-themed simulation software, which allowed\\nus to model and simulate the behavior of complex, aquatic systems. We used this software to study the\\ndynamics of ocean currents, the behavior of aquatic ecosystems, and the impact of human activities\\non the aquatic environment. The results of these simulations revealed a number of significant patterns\\nand trends, which have important implications for our understanding of the aquatic world and its role\\nin the Earth’s ecosystem.\\nFurthermore, our research team conducted an exhaustive review of existing patents and intellectual\\nproperty related to water, discovering a number of innovative, aquatic-themed inventions and tech-\\nnologies. We found that many of these inventions and technologies have the potential to transform a\\nwide range of industries, from agriculture and energy to transportation and construction. We also\\ndiscovered that many of these inventions and technologies are based on a deep understanding of the\\nproperties and behaviors of water, which is essential for their development and implementation.\\nThe next phase of our research involved the development of a new, aquatic-themed research frame-\\nwork, which we termed \"hydro-research 2.0.\" This framework involves the use of advanced, aquatic-\\nthemed technologies and techniques, such as aquatic-themed crowdsourcing and aquatic-themed\\ncitizen science. We used this framework to study the behavior of aquatic systems, the impact of\\nhuman activities on the aquatic environment, and the potential applications of water in various fields.\\nThe results of this research revealed a number of significant patterns and trends, which have important\\nimplications for our understanding of the aquatic world and its role in the Earth’s ecosystem.\\nIn another line of investigation, we explored the relationship between water and the human body,\\ndiscovering that the molecular structure of water is eerily similar to the structure of human cells. This\\nled us to propose a new hypothesis, suggesting that the human body is capable of communicating with\\nwater molecules through a process of quantum entanglement, allowing us to tap into the collective\\n7unconscious of the aquatic world. We tested this hypothesis using a series of experiments, involving\\nthe use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the brain activity of subjects\\nwhile they were submerged in a tank of water. The results were nothing short of astonishing,\\nrevealing a significant increase in brain activity in areas associated with creativity, imagination, and\\naquatic-themed thought patterns.\\nMoreover, our research team investigated the potential applications of water in the field of ar-\\nchitecture, discovering that the molecular structure of water can be used to create sophisticated,\\naquatic-based building materials and designs. We developed a novel algorithm, which we termed\\n\"hydro-architecture,\" which uses the properties of water to simulate the behavior of complex, adap-\\ntive systems. This algorithm has significant implications for the development of more sustainable,\\nenvironmentally-friendly buildings and structures, which can adapt and respond to changing environ-\\nmental conditions.\\nThe investigation of water also led us to explore the realm of aquatic-themed philosophy and ethics,\\nwhere we discovered a rich tapestry of ideas and concepts surrounding the nature and significance of\\nwater. We found that many ancient cultures believed in the existence of a deep, spiritual connection\\nbetween humans and the aquatic world, which is essential for our well-being and survival. We\\nanalyzed these ideas and concepts, using a\\n4 Experiments\\nThe initialization of our research endeavor commenced with an exhaustive examination of the onto-\\nlogical implications of water on the spacetime continuum, which surprisingly led us to investigate the\\naerodynamic properties of flamingos in mid-flight, as they ostensibly pertained to the hydrodynamic\\nviscosities of various aquatic substances, including, but not limited to, engine oil, bubble solution,\\nand gelatinous desserts. This probe into the fluid dynamics of waterfowl eventually segued into an\\nin-depth analysis of the societal repercussions of disco music on the cultural fabric of 1970s-era\\nurban metropolises, which, in turn, revealed a plethora of fascinating correlations between polyester\\nfabric production and the thermodynamic properties of water molecules in solution.\\nThe experimental paradigm we devised to investigate these phenomena involved the construction\\nof a large, geodesic dome filled with a precise mixture of water, dish soap, and glitter, which was\\nthen subjected to a controlled sequence of sonic booms, ambient temperature fluctuations, and\\ninterpretive dance performances, all while being monitored by a state-of-the-art array of sensors,\\ncameras, and snack food dispensers. As the data began to pour in, our team of expert researchers\\nnoticed a statistically significant trend indicating that the viscosity of the water-soap-glitter mixture\\nwas directly proportional to the number of times the disco classic \"Stayin’ Alive\" was played in the\\nvicinity of the experimental apparatus, a finding that was subsequently corroborated by a series of\\nfollow-up studies involving the effects of Barry Manilow’s music on the crystalline structures of ice\\nformations.\\nIn an effort to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these observations, we constructed\\na small, tabletop model of a black hole using a mixture of play dough, coffee grounds, and discarded\\nVHS tapes, which was then used to simulate the gravitational effects of various celestial bodies on\\nthe space-time continuum, including, but not limited to, the moon, the sun, and a small, spinning\\ntop.

This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the\\norigins of life on Earth and raises important questions about the potential for life to exist on other\\nplanets, particularly those with high concentrations of glitter.\\nOne of the most surprising outcomes of our research was the discovery that the water-soap-glitter\\nmixture exhibits a unique form of intelligence, which we have dubbed \"glintelligence,\" that is capable\\n8of solving complex mathematical problems and playing chess at a level that is competitive with\\nthe world’s top grandmasters. This raises important questions about the nature of intelligence and\\nwhether it is possible for inanimate objects to possess a form of consciousness that is similar to that\\nof living beings.\\nIn order to further investigate the properties of glintelligence, we constructed a series of complex\\npuzzles and challenges that were designed to test the limits of the water-soap-glitter mixture’s\\nproblem-solving abilities, including a miniature version of the classic game show \"Jeopardy!\" and a\\nscale model of the Mona Lisa that was made out of nothing but playing cards and twine.

By integrating\\nmicrobial genome sequencing data, high-resolution images of bread crumb struc-\\ntures, and audio recordings of dough mixing patterns, our model is able to identify\\npreviously unknown correlations between microbial community composition and\\nbread texture. Surprisingly, our results indicate that the inclusion of a specially de-\\nsigned playlist of ambient electronic music during the dough fermentation process\\ncan significantly enhance the development of a desirable crumb structure, with an\\nobserved increase in crumb symmetry of up to 37.5\\n1 Introduction\\nThe pursuit of the ’perfect crumb’ in sourdough bread has been a longstanding endeavor, with\\nbakers and scientists alike seeking to understand the intricate relationships between microorganisms,\\nenvironment, and dough composition. Recent advancements in multi-modal transformers have\\npresented a novel approach to analyzing sourdough microbiomes, allowing for the integration of\\ndiverse data modalities, such as microbial community profiles, spectroscopic analyses of dough,\\nand even baker-generated narratives of the bread-making process. By leveraging these transformer-\\nbased architectures, researchers can uncover complex patterns and interactions within sourdough\\necosystems, potentially leading to breakthroughs in crumb quality and consistency.\\nInterestingly, preliminary studies have suggested that the application of multi-modal transformers\\nto sourdough microbiome analysis may also have unforeseen benefits, such as the ability to predict\\nthe aesthetic appeal of bread crusts based on the presence of specific microbial metabolites. Further-\\nmore, some researchers have proposed that the use of transformers in this context may enable the\\ndevelopment of novel, microbiome-inspired approaches to bread flavor profiling, wherein the unique\\nmetabolic signatures of sourdough microorganisms are used to generate flavor predictions for newly\\nformulated bread recipes.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, a recent experiment involving the application of multi-modal transform-\\ners to a dataset of sourdough microbiomes and corresponding bread samples revealed a statistically\\nsignificant correlation between the presence of certain microbial taxa and the likelihood of bread\\nloaves exhibiting unusual, non-repeating patterns of crust formation. While the underlying mecha-\\nnisms driving this phenomenon are not yet fully understood, preliminary analyses suggest that the\\ntransformers may be capturing subtle, previously unrecognized interactions between microorganisms\\nand the physical environment of the dough, which in turn influence the emergent properties of the\\nbread crust.\\nThe integration of multi-modal transformers into sourdough microbiome research also raises in-\\ntriguing questions regarding the potential for machine learning-driven approaches to bread quality\\ncontrol and assurance. For instance, could transformers be trained to detect early warning signsof microbiome imbalance or dysfunction, allowing bakers to intervene and adjust their recipes or\\nfermentation protocols to prevent suboptimal crumb formation? Alternatively, might the use of\\ntransformers in this context enable the development of novel, AI-driven bread formulation tools,\\nwherein the complex interplay between microorganisms, ingredients, and environmental factors is\\noptimized to produce breads with desirable texture, flavor, and appearance characteristics?\\nAs researchers continue to explore the applications and implications of multi-modal transformers\\nin sourdough microbiome analysis, it is clear that this emerging field of study holds tremendous\\npotential for advancing our understanding of the intricate, complex relationships governing bread\\nquality and consistency. Moreover, the unexpected findings and tangents that have already begun to\\nemerge from this line of inquiry serve as a testament to the boundless creativity and innovation that\\ncan arise when disparate disciplines and approaches are brought to bear on a shared problem – in this\\ncase, the pursuit of the perfect crumb.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe study of sourdough microbiomes has been a subject of interest in recent years, with various\\napproaches being employed to analyze and understand the complex interactions between microor-\\nganisms in sourdough starters. One notable approach is the use of machine learning algorithms\\nto identify patterns in microbiome data, with some researchers proposing the use of convolutional\\nneural networks to classify sourdough starters based on their microbiome composition. However,\\nthese methods have been limited by their reliance on single-modal data, such as 16S rRNA gene\\nsequencing or metabolomics profiles, which only provide a partial view of the sourdough ecosystem.\\nIn contrast, multi-modal transformers have been proposed as a means of integrating multiple data\\nmodalities, including images, audio, and text, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of complex\\nsystems. For example, some researchers have used multi-modal transformers to analyze the sounds\\nproduced by sourdough starters during fermentation, with the goal of identifying acoustic patterns\\nthat are correlated with desirable crumb textures. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it has\\nbeen shown to yield surprisingly accurate predictions of crumb quality, with one study reporting a\\nsignificant positive correlation between the frequency of CO2 bubbles bursting and the development\\nof an open, airy crumb structure.\\nAnother unexpected approach to analyzing sourdough microbiomes involves the use of fungal\\nmycelium-based neural networks, which are essentially networks of fungal hyphae that are trained to\\nrecognize patterns in sourdough-related data. Proponents of this approach argue that fungal mycelium-\\nbased neural networks are capable of learning complex relationships between microorganisms and\\ntheir environment, and can even be used to control the fermentation process in real-time. However,\\ncritics have pointed out that the use of fungal mycelium-based neural networks is still largely\\nspeculative, and that more research is needed to fully understand their potential applications in\\nsourdough analysis.\\nIn addition to these approaches, some researchers have explored the use of chaos theory and fractal\\nanalysis to understand the complex dynamics of sourdough microbiomes. By applying techniques\\nsuch as the Lyapunov exponent and the fractal dimension, these researchers have been able to identify\\npatterns in sourdough data that are not apparent through other methods. For example, one study found\\nthat the fractal dimension of sourdough starters is correlated with their ability to produce bread with\\na desirable crumb texture, with higher fractal dimensions corresponding to more open, airy crumb\\nstructures.\\nOverall, the study of sourdough microbiomes is a rapidly evolving field, with new and innovative\\napproaches being proposed all the time. While some of these approaches may seem unusual or\\neven bizarre, they have the potential to yield new insights into the complex interactions between\\nmicroorganisms in sourdough starters, and may ultimately lead to the development of new methods\\nfor producing high-quality bread with the perfect crumb. Furthermore, the application of sourdough\\nmicrobiome analysis has been extended to other fields, such as the study of gut microbiomes and\\nthe development of novel probiotics, highlighting the potential for interdisciplinary collaborations\\nand knowledge transfer. The use of sourdough as a model system for studying complex microbial\\necosystems has also sparked interest in the development of novel biotechnological applications,\\nincluding the production of biofuels and the degradation of environmental pollutants.\\n23 Methodology\\nTo investigate the intricate relationships between sourdough microbiomes and the elusive ’perfect\\ncrumb’, we employed a novel multi-modal transformer architecture. This approach integrated\\nmicrobiome sequencing data, high-resolution crumb structure images, and a unique dataset of\\nartisanal bakers’ descriptive narratives. The transformer model, dubbed ’Crumbinator’, was trained\\non a dataset comprising 500 sourdough samples, each accompanied by a comprehensive profile of\\nits microbiome, a high-resolution image of the bread’s crumb structure, and a descriptive passage\\npenned by an experienced baker.\\nThe microbiome data was generated using a combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metage-\\nnomic analysis, providing a detailed snapshot of the microbial community present in each sourdough\\nsample. The crumb structure images were captured using a custom-built photography setup, designed\\nto minimize variations in lighting and camera settings. The descriptive narratives, on the other hand,\\nwere collected through a series of in-depth interviews with artisanal bakers, who were asked to\\ndescribe the sensory characteristics, texture, and overall appeal of each bread sample.\\nIn a surprising twist, we discovered that incorporating a module that analyzed the bakers’ narratives\\nfor subtle patterns and emotional undertones significantly improved the model’s performance. This\\n’emotional intelligence’ module, inspired by the principles of affective computing, enabled the\\nCrumbinator to capture the intricate, often subconscious connections between the bakers’ perceptions\\nand the underlying microbiome dynamics. Furthermore, we found that feeding the model a steady\\ndiet of baking-themed poetry and literary excerpts during the training process had a profound impact\\non its ability to generalize to unseen data, supposedly by fostering a deeper understanding of the\\ncultural and historical context of bread-making.\\nTo further augment the model’s capabilities, we introduced a ’sonification’ module, which converted\\nthe microbiome data into a unique soundscape for each sample. This audio representation was then\\nused as an additional input modality, allowing the Crumbinator to tap into the harmonic patterns and\\nrhythmic structures that underlie the microbial dynamics. While this approach may seem unorthodox,\\nour preliminary results suggest that the sonification module enables the model to capture subtle,\\npreviously unknown relationships between the microbiome and the resulting crumb structure.\\nThe Crumbinator’s architecture was designed to accommodate these diverse input modalities, fea-\\nturing a series of interconnected attention mechanisms and multi-modal fusion layers. The model\\nwas trained using a custom-designed loss function, which balanced the reconstruction accuracy\\nof the microbiome data, the perceptual quality of the generated crumb structure images, and the\\ncoherence of the descriptive narratives. Through this innovative approach, we aimed to create a\\nholistic, multi-faceted understanding of the complex interplay between sourdough microbiomes and\\nthe pursuit of the perfect crumb.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo evaluate the efficacy of our proposed Multi-Modal Transformers for analyzing sourdough micro-\\nbiomes, we conducted a series of experiments that not only assessed the model’s performance in\\npredicting the ’perfect crumb’ but also explored unconventional approaches to enhance our under-\\nstanding of this complex ecosystem. The experiments were divided into three phases: data collection,\\nmodel training, and evaluation.\\nIn the data collection phase, we compiled a comprehensive dataset consisting of microbial compo-\\nsitions, temperature, humidity, and audio recordings of the dough fermentation process. The audio\\nrecordings, which we termed ’sourdough sonification,’ were obtained by placing a contact microphone\\non the dough surface, capturing the subtle vibrations and sounds emitted during fermentation. We\\nhypothesized that these audio signals might contain hidden patterns that could inform our model\\nabout the underlying microbial dynamics.\\nOur model training phase involved fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer architecture on our dataset,\\nwith a twist. We introduced a custom ’crumb quality’ loss function that penalized the model for\\npredicting anything less than a ’perfect crumb.’ This loss function was inspired by the principles of\\nchaos theory and involved the use of the Lorenz attractor to introduce randomness and unpredictability\\n3into the optimization process. Although this approach seemed counterintuitive, we found that it\\nimproved the model’s performance on our validation set.\\nIn a bizarre turn of events, we discovered that our model’s predictions were significantly improved\\nwhen we fed it a constant stream of 1980s disco music during training. We speculate that the rhythmic\\npatterns and melodies in this genre of music somehow resonated with the microbial rhythms in the\\nsourdough, leading to a more harmonious and balanced crumb structure. To quantify this effect, we\\ncreated a ’disco index’ that measured the model’s performance as a function of the amount of disco\\nmusic played during training.\\nTable 1: Effect of Disco Music on Model Performance\\nDisco Index Model Accuracy Crumb Quality Microbial Diversity Perfect Crumb Ratio\\n0 (no disco) 0.80 0.75 0.60 0.20\\n0.5 (low disco) 0.85 0.80 0.65 0.25\\n1.0 (medium disco) 0.90 0.85 0.70 0.30\\n2.0 (high disco) 0.95 0.90 0.75 0.40\\nThe evaluation phase of our experiments involved testing our model on a holdout set of sourdough\\nsamples and comparing its performance to that of a panel of human expert bakers. Surprisingly, our\\nmodel outperformed the human experts in 75% of the cases, with the remaining 25% resulting in what\\nwe termed ’crumb singularity’ – a phenomenon where the model’s predictions and the human experts’\\nassessments converged to produce a crumb that was simultaneously perfect and imperfect. This\\nparadoxical outcome has significant implications for our understanding of the sourdough microbiome\\nand the elusive ’perfect crumb.’\\nIn an unexpected twist, we found that our model’s predictions were also influenced by the phase of\\nthe moon and the proximity of the bakery to a nearby park. We speculate that these environmental\\nfactors may be affecting the microbial composition of the sourdough in ways that are not yet fully\\nunderstood. To investigate this further, we plan to conduct a series of experiments involving sourdough\\nfermentation in controlled lunar and environmental conditions. The results of these experiments will\\nbe reported in a future study, pending the approval of our research funding proposal, which includes\\na request for a custom-built, disco-equipped sourdough fermentation chamber.\\n5 Results\\nOur experiments yielded a multitude of intriguing results, with the most notable being the discovery\\nthat the application of Multi-Modal Transformers to sourdough microbiome analysis can, in fact,\\npredict the perfect crumb structure with an accuracy of 87.32\\nOne unexpected finding was that the model’s performance was significantly improved when the audio\\nrecordings were replaced with recordings of ASMR soundscapes, featuring gentle whispers and\\ntapping sounds.

Existing methods often struggle in this scenario, typically requiring\\nmultiple proxy variables to account for the unobserved confounding or relying on strong, often\\nunrealistic, assumptions about the data generating process. These limitations significantly restrict\\nthe applicability of these methods in real-world settings where obtaining multiple reliable proxies\\ncan be challenging or even impossible.

Traditional\\napproaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as the availability of multiple proxy variables [1,\\n2] or the imposition of restrictive functional forms on the relationships between variables [3]. These\\nassumptions can be difficult to justify in practice, limiting the applicability of these methods. For\\ninstance, methods based on instrumental variables [4] require the identification of a variable that\\naffects the treatment but not the outcome directly, a condition that is often hard to satisfy. Similarly,\\ntechniques relying on conditional independence assumptions [5] may be sensitive to violations of\\nthese assumptions, leading to biased estimates. Our approach offers a significant advantage by\\nrelaxing these stringent requirements.\\nSeveral recent works have explored the use of proxy variables for handling latent confounding [6,\\n7]. However, these methods often require multiple proxies, which can be challenging to obtain in\\nmany real-world applications. Furthermore, the performance of these methods can be sensitive to\\nthe quality and number of proxies used. In contrast, our method leverages a single proxy variable,\\nmaking it more practical and robust to the limitations of proxy data. The use of cross-moments\\nto extract additional information from the observed data is a key innovation that distinguishes our\\napproach from existing methods.\\nThe use of cross-moments in causal inference has been explored in various contexts [8, 9]. However,\\nthese methods often focus on specific model structures or make strong assumptions about the data\\ngenerating process. Our approach provides a more general framework that can handle a wider range\\nof scenarios. The theoretical guarantees we provide offer a solid foundation for the reliability and\\nvalidity of our method, addressing a critical gap in the existing literature. This rigorous theoretical\\nanalysis distinguishes our work from purely empirical approaches.\\nOur algorithm also addresses the challenge of high-dimensional data, a common issue in modern\\ncausal inference problems. Many existing methods struggle with the computational complexity\\nassociated with high-dimensional data, limiting their applicability to large-scale datasets. Our\\nmethod’s efficiency and scalability make it particularly well-suited for such scenarios. This scalability\\nis achieved through the efficient use of cross-moments and the development of computationally\\nefficient algorithms. This aspect of our work contributes to the growing need for scalable causal\\ninference techniques.\\n2Finally, our work contributes to the broader goal of developing more robust and reliable causal\\ninference methods. The ability to accurately estimate causal effects in the presence of latent con-\\nfounders is crucial for many applications, ranging from healthcare to social sciences. Our method’s\\nability to handle latent confounders with a single proxy variable, coupled with its robustness and\\nscalability, represents a significant advancement in the field. The development of user-friendly\\nsoftware implementing this algorithm will further enhance its accessibility and impact.\\n3 Methodology\\nOur proposed method leverages a single proxy variable and cross-moments to identify and estimate\\ncausal effects in linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with latent confounders. Unlike existing\\nmethods that often require multiple proxy variables or strong assumptions, our approach offers a\\nmore practical and robust solution. The core idea is to exploit the information contained in the\\ncross-moments of the observed variables to disentangle the direct effect of the treatment from\\nthe indirect effect mediated by the latent confounder. This is achieved by carefully analyzing\\nthe relationships between the observed variables and the single proxy variable, allowing us to\\neffectively account for the unobserved confounding. The algorithm is designed to be robust to\\nmodel misspecification and capable of handling high-dimensional data, making it suitable for a\\nwide range of real-world applications. The algorithm’s efficiency stems from its ability to directly\\nutilize cross-moments, avoiding computationally expensive iterative procedures often found in other\\nmethods. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when dealing with large datasets. Furthermore,\\nthe algorithm’s theoretical foundations are rigorously established, providing strong guarantees on\\nits performance and reliability. The theoretical analysis ensures that the estimated causal effects are\\nconsistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. This rigorous theoretical framework\\ndistinguishes our approach from purely empirical methods. The algorithm’s robustness is further\\nenhanced by its ability to handle noisy data and model misspecification, ensuring reliable results even\\nin challenging scenarios. The algorithm’s design incorporates techniques to mitigate the impact of\\nnoise and model misspecification, leading to more accurate and stable estimates. The algorithm’s\\nmodular design allows for easy extension and adaptation to different settings.\\nThe algorithm proceeds in three main steps. First, we estimate the cross-moments of the observed\\nvariables, including the treatment, outcome, and proxy variable. These cross-moments capture the\\ncomplex relationships between the variables and provide crucial information for identifying the causal\\neffect. The estimation of these cross-moments is performed using robust statistical techniques that are\\nresistant to outliers and noise. The choice of estimation method is crucial for ensuring the accuracy\\nand robustness of the subsequent steps. We employ a method that is both efficient and robust to outliers\\nand noise, ensuring reliable estimates even in the presence of noisy data. The second step involves\\nsolving a system of equations derived from the estimated cross-moments. This system of equations is\\ncarefully constructed to leverage the information contained in the cross-moments to identify the causal\\neffect. The solution to this system of equations provides an estimate of the causal effect, accounting\\nfor the latent confounder. The solution is obtained using efficient numerical methods that are designed\\nto handle potential numerical instabilities. The third step involves constructing confidence intervals\\nfor the estimated causal effect. This step provides a measure of uncertainty associated with the\\nestimate, allowing for a more complete understanding of the results. The confidence intervals are\\nconstructed using asymptotic theory, providing valid inferences even in large samples. The entire\\nprocess is designed to be computationally efficient, allowing for the analysis of large datasets.\\nThe theoretical properties of the algorithm are rigorously established, ensuring its reliability and\\nvalidity. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under mild\\nconditions. These theoretical guarantees provide a strong foundation for the application of the\\nalgorithm in various settings. The consistency result ensures that the estimator converges to the true\\ncausal effect as the sample size increases. The asymptotic normality result allows for the construction\\nof valid confidence intervals, providing a measure of uncertainty associated with the estimate. The\\ntheoretical analysis also provides insights into the algorithm’s robustness to model misspecification\\nand the impact of noise.

The second advancement involves\\nthe integration of semantic context into the parsing procedure by utilizing global\\nlabel costs. Instead of relying on sets derived from image retrieval, the technique\\ndescribed assigns a comprehensive likelihood estimate to each label, which is\\nsubsequently incorporated into the overall energy function. The effectiveness\\nof the system is assessed using two expansive datasets, SIFTflow and LMSun.\\nThe system demonstrates performance that is at the forefront of the field on the\\nSIFTflow dataset and achieves outcomes that are close to setting new records on\\nthe LMSun dataset.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe task of scene parsing involves assigning semantic labels to every pixel within an image of a\\nscene. Algorithms for image parsing attempt to categorize different types of scenes, both indoors and\\noutdoors, such as a shoreline, a roadway, an urban environment, and an airport. Numerous systems\\nhave been developed to categorize each pixel in an image semantically. A significant obstacle for\\nimage parsing methods is the considerable variability in recognition rates across different types of\\nclasses. Background classes, which usually cover a significant area of the image’s pixels, often have a\\nuniform look and are identified with great accuracy. Foreground classes, which usually take up fewer\\npixels in the image, have changeable forms and might be hidden or set up in various ways. These\\nkinds of classes represent noticeable parts of the image that frequently grab a viewer’s attention.\\nHowever, their recognition rates are often much lower than those of background classes, making\\nthem frequent examples of unsuccessful recognition.\\nImpressive results have been obtained by parametric scene parsing techniques on datasets with a\\nlimited number of labels. Nevertheless, for considerably bigger datasets with a lot of labels, using\\nthese techniques becomes more challenging because of the increased demands on learning and\\noptimization.\\nNonparametric image parsing techniques have recently been introduced to tackle the growing variety\\nof scene types and semantic labels effectively. These methods usually begin by reducing the com-\\nplexity of the problem from individual pixels to superpixels. Initially, a set of images is selected,\\nconsisting of training images that bear the closest visual resemblance to the image being queried.\\nThe potential labels for a specific image are limited to those found in the selected set of images.\\nSubsequently, the probability scores for the classification of superpixels are determined by matching\\nvisual characteristics. Ultimately, context is applied by reducing an energy function that includes both\\nthe expense of the data and information on how often classes appear together in nearby superpixels.\\n.A shared difficulty encountered by nonparametric parsing methods is the phase of image retrieval.\\nEven though image retrieval helps narrow down the number of labels to think about, it’s seen as a\\nvery important step in the process. There’s no opportunity to correct the mistake if the correct labels\\nare not among the images that were retrieved. It has been reported that mistakes in retrieval are the\\nmain reason for most unsuccessful cases.\\nA novel nonparametric image parsing algorithm is proposed in this work, aiming for enhanced\\noverall precision and improved identification rates for classes that are less commonly represented. An\\nefficient system is developed that can adapt to an ever-growing quantity of labels. The contributions\\nmade are outlined as follows:\\n1. Superpixel label likelihood scores are improved by merging classifiers. The system merges\\nthe output probabilities from several classification models to generate a more equitable score for\\neach label at every superpixel. The weights for merging the scores are determined by employing a\\nlikelihood normalization technique on the training set in an automated manner. 2. Semantic context is\\nintegrated within a probabilistic structure. To prevent the removal of important labels that cannot be\\nretrieved later, a retrieval set is not structured. Instead, label costs are utilized, which are determined\\nfrom the global contextual relationships of labels in analogous scenes, to obtain enhanced parsing\\noutcomes.\\nThe system developed achieves top-tier per-pixel recognition accuracy on two extensive datasets:\\nSIFTflow, which includes 2688 images with 33 labels, and LMSun, which has 45576 images with\\n232 labels.\\n2 Related Work\\nSeveral techniques for scene parsing, both parametric and nonparametric, have been suggested. The\\nnonparametric systems that try to cover a wide range of semantic classes are very similar to the\\nmethod. Different methods are used to improve the overall effectiveness of nonparametric parsing.\\nThe authors merge region-parsing with outputs from per-exemplar SVM detectors. Object masks\\nare transferred by per-exemplar detectors into the test image for segmentation. Their method greatly\\nimproves overall accuracy, but it requires a lot of computer power. It’s hard to scale because data\\nterms need to be calibrated using a batch of fine training in a leave-one-out way, which is hard to do.\\nSuperpixels from rare classes are specifically added to the retrieval set to make them more visible.\\nThe authors filter the list of labels for a test image by doing an image retrieval step, and query time\\nis used to add more samples to rare classes. The way superpixels are classified, how rare classes\\nare recognized, and how semantic context is applied are all different in this system. By combining\\nclassification costs from different contextual models, a more balanced set of label costs is produced,\\nwhich promotes the representation of foreground classes. Instead of using image retrieval, global\\nlabel costs are used in the inference step.\\nThe value of semantic context has been thoroughly investigated in numerous visual recognition\\nalgorithms. Context has been employed to enhance the overall labeling performance through a\\nfeedback mechanism in nonparametric scene parsing systems. Initial labeling of superpixels in a\\nquery image is utilized to modify the training set by adjusting for recognized background classes,\\nthereby enhancing the visibility of uncommon classes. The objective is to enhance the image retrieval\\nset by reintroducing segments of uncommon classes. A semantic global descriptor is generated.\\nImage retrieval is enhanced by merging the semantic descriptor with the visual descriptors. Context\\nis added by creating global and local context descriptors based on classification likelihood maps. The\\nmethod described differs from these methods as it does not employ context at each superpixel when\\ncalculating a global context descriptor. Instead, contextual information across the entire image is\\ntaken into account.\\nContextually relevant outcomes are produced by deducing label correlations in comparable scene\\nimages. Additionally, there is no retrieval set that needs to be enriched. Rather, the global context is\\nstructured within a probabilistic framework, where label costs are calculated across the whole image.\\nFurthermore, the global context is executed in real time without any preliminary training. Another\\nmethod of image parsing that doesn’t use retrieval sets is where image labeling is done by moving\\nannotations from a graph of patch matches across image sets. But this method needs a lot of memory,\\nwhich makes it hard to scale for big datasets.\\n2The presented method draws inspiration from the combination of classifier techniques in machine\\nlearning, which have demonstrated the ability to enhance the capabilities of individual classifiers.\\nSeveral fusion methods have been effectively applied in various fields of computer vision, including\\ndetecting faces, annotating images with multiple labels, tracking objects, and recognizing characters.\\nNonetheless, the classifiers that make up these systems and the ways they are combined are very\\ndifferent from the framework, and the other methods have only been tested on small datasets.\\n3 Baseline Parsing Pipeline\\nThis section provides a summary of the basic image parsing system, which is composed of three\\nstages: feature extraction, label likelihood estimation at superpixels, and inference.\\nAfterward, contributions are presented: enhancing likelihoods at superpixels and calculating label\\ncosts for global context at the scene level.\\n3.1 Segmentation and Feature Extraction\\nTo reduce the complexity of the task, the image is partitioned into superpixels. Extraction of\\nsuperpixels from images begins by employing an efficient graph-based method. For each superpixel,\\n20 distinct types of local features are extracted to characterize its shape, appearance, texture, color, and\\nposition, adhering to established methods. In addition to these features, Fisher Vector (FV) descriptors\\nare extracted at each superpixel using an established library. Computation of 128-dimensional dense\\nSIFT feature descriptors is performed on five different patch sizes (8, 12, 16, 24, 30). A dictionary\\ncomprising 1024 words is constructed. Subsequently, the FV descriptors are retrieved and Principal\\nComponent Analysis (PCA) is applied to decrease their dimensionality to 512. Each superpixel is\\nrepresented by a feature vector that has 2202 dimensions.\\n3.2 Label Likelihood Estimation\\nThe features obtained in the prior stage are utilized to determine label probabilities for each superpixel.\\nUnlike conventional approaches, the possible labels for a test image are not restricted. Instead, the\\ndata term for the likelihood of each class label c C is computed, where C represents the total number\\nof classes in the dataset. The normalized cost D(l<sub>si</sub> = c|s<sub>i</sub>) of assigning\\nlabel c to superpixel s<sub>i</sub> is given by:\\nD(lsi = c|si) = 1− 1\\n1 +e−Lunbal(si,c) (1)\\nwhere L<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) is the log-likelihood ratio score of label c, given by\\nL<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) = 1/2 log(P(s<sub>i</sub>|c)/P(s<sub>i</sub>|¬c)), where\\n¬c = C c is the set of all labels except c, and P(s<sub>i</sub>|c) is the likelihood of superpixel\\ns<sub>i</sub> given c. A boosted decision tree (BDT) model is trained to obtain the label likelihoods\\nL<sub>unbal</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c). For implementation, a publicly accessible boostDT library\\nis utilized. During this phase, the BDT model is trained using every superpixel in the training set,\\nwhich constitutes an imbalanced distribution of class labels C.\\n3.3 Smoothing and Inference\\nThe optimization challenge is formulated as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to determine\\nthe ultimate labeling L through Markov Random Field (MRF) inference. Using only the estimated\\nlikelihoods from the preceding section to categorize superpixels leads to imprecise classifications.\\nIncorporating a smoothing term V(l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>, l<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub>) into\\nthe MRF energy function aims to address this problem by penalizing adjacent superpixels with\\nsemantically incongruous labels. The goal is to minimize the following energy function:\\nE(L) =\\nX\\nsi∈S\\nD(lsi = c|si) +λ\\nX\\n(i,j)∈A\\nV (lsi , lsj ) (2)\\n3where A represents the set of neighboring superpixel indices and V(l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>,\\nl<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub>) denotes the penalty for assigning labels l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>\\nand l<sub>s<sub>j</sub></sub> to two adjacent pixels, calculated from occurrences in the training\\nset combined with the constant Potts model following established methods. is the smoothing constant.\\nInference is conducted using the -expansion method with established code.\\n4 Improving Superpixel Label Costs\\nAlthough foreground objects typically stand out the most in a picture of a scene, parsing algorithms\\nfrequently misclassify them. For instance, in an image of a city street, a person would usually first\\nspot the individuals, signs, and vehicles before they would see the structures and the street. However,\\nbecause of two primary factors, scene parsing algorithms frequently misclassify foreground regions\\nas belonging to the surrounding background. Initially, in the superpixel classification phase, any\\nclassifier would naturally prefer classes that are more prevalent to reduce the overall training error.\\nSecondly, during the MRF smoothing phase, a lot of the superpixels that were accurately identified as\\nforeground objects are smoothed out by the background pixels around them.\\nIt is suggested that the label likelihood score at each superpixel be improved to obtain a more precise\\nparsing output. Various classifiers are designed that provide supplementary information regarding\\nthe data. Subsequently, all the developed models are merged to produce a unified conclusion. An\\noverview of the method for merging classifiers is displayed in Figure 1. During the testing phase,\\nthe label likelihood scores from all the BDT models are combined to generate the final scores for\\nsuperpixels.\\n4.1 Fusing Classifiers\\nThe proposed method is inspired by ensemble classifier methods, which train several classifiers and\\nmerge them to enhance decision-making. These methods are especially helpful when the classifiers\\nare distinct. In other words, the decrease in error is connected to the lack of correlation between the\\nmodels that were trained. This means that the total error is decreased if the classifiers misclassify\\ndifferent data points. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that for large datasets, dividing the\\ntraining set yields superior results compared to dividing the feature space.\\nIt has been observed that the classification error for a particular class is correlated with the average\\nnumber of pixels it covers in the scene images, as indicated by the blue line in Figure 2. This is in\\nline with what earlier methods found, which is that the rate of classification error is related to how\\noften classes show up in the training set. However, it goes beyond that by taking into account how\\noften the classes appear at the image level, which is meant to solve the problem of less-represented\\nclasses being smoothed out by a background class that is nearby.\\nTo achieve this, three BDT models are trained using the following training data criteria: (1) a balanced\\nsubsample of all classes C in the dataset, (2) a balanced subsample of classes that occupy an average\\nof less than z\\nThe goal of these decisions is to lessen the correlation between the trained BDT models, as seen in\\nFigure 2. The balanced classifiers are able to correctly identify some of the less-represented classes,\\nbut they make more mistakes on the more-represented classes. The unbalanced classifier, on the\\nother hand, mostly misclassifies the less-represented classes. Combining the likelihoods from all\\nthe classifiers leads to an improved overall decision that enhances the representation of all classes\\n(Figure 1). It was noticed that the addition of more classifiers did not enhance performance for any of\\nthe datasets.\\nThe ultimate expense of allocating a label c to a superpixel s<sub>i</sub> can subsequently be\\nexpressed as the amalgamation of the likelihood scores of all classifiers:\\nD(lsi = c|si) = 1− 1\\n1 +e−Lcomb(si,c) (3)\\nwhere L<sub>comb</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) represents the combined likelihood score obtained by\\nthe weighted sum of the scores from all classifiers:\\n4Lcomb(si, c) =\\nX\\nj=1,2,3,4\\nwj(c)Lj(si, c) (4)\\nwhere L<sub>j</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>, c) is the score from the j<sup>th</sup> classifier, and\\nw<sub>j</sub>(c) is the normalized weight of the likelihood score of class c in the j<sup>th</sup>\\nclassifier.\\n4.2 Normalized Weight Learning\\nThe weights w\\nw < sub > j < /sub >(c)]arelearned forallclassesCinofflinesettingsusingthetrainingset.T heweightsarecalculatedindependentlyforeachclassifier.T heweight˜w < sub > j < /sub >(c)forclasscinthej < sup > th < /sup > classifierisdeterminedbyaveragingtheratioofthetotallikelihoodsforclassctothetotallikelihoodsforallclassesc < sub > i < /sub > Ccacrossallsuperpixelss < sub > i < /sub > S:\\n˜wj(c) = 1\\n|Cj|\\nP\\nsi∈S Lj(si, c)P\\nci∈C\\\\c\\nP\\nsi∈S Lj(si, ci) (5)\\nwhere |C<sub>j</sub>| denotes the quantity of classes encompassed by the j<sup>th</sup> classifier\\nand not covered by any other classifier with a fewer number of classes.\\nThe normalized weight w<sub>j</sub>(c) of class c can then be computed as: w<sub>j</sub>(c) =\\n~w<sub>j</sub>(c) / <sub>j=1,2,3,4</sub>(~w<sub>j</sub>(c)). Normalizing the output likelihoods\\nin this way improves the likelihood that all classifiers will be taken into account in the outcome, with\\na focus on classes that are less represented.\\n5 Scene-Level Global Context\\nWhen working with scene parsing challenges, including the scene’s semantics in the labeling process\\nis beneficial. For example, if a scene is known to be a beach scene, labels such as sea, sand, and sky\\nare expected to be found with a much greater probability than labels like car, building, or fence. The\\ninitial labeling results of a test image are used in estimating the likelihoods of all labels c C. The\\nlikelihoods are estimated globally over an image, i.e., there is a unique cost per label per image. The\\nglobal label costs are then incorporated into a subsequent MRF inference stage to enhance the results.\\nThe presented method, in contrast to previous methods, does not restrict the number of labels to\\nthose found in the retrieval set. Instead, it utilizes the set to calculate the likelihood of class labels\\nin a k-nn manner. The likelihoods are normalized by counts over the entire dataset and smoothed\\nto provide an opportunity for labels not present in the retrieval set. The likelihoods are also used in\\nMRF optimization, not for reducing the number of labels.\\n5.1 Context-Aware Global Label Costs\\nIt is proposed that semantic context be incorporated by using label statistics instead of global visual\\nfeatures. The reasoning behind this decision is that sorting by global visual characteristics often\\ndoesn’t find images that are similar at the scene level. For instance, a highway scene might be\\nmistaken for a beach scene if road pixels are incorrectly classified as sand. Nonetheless, when given a\\nreasonably accurate initial labeling, sorting by label statistics finds images that are more semantically\\nrelated. This helps to eliminate outlier labels and find labels that are absent in a scene.\\nFor a given test image I, minimizing the energy function in equation 2 produces an initial labeling\\nL of the superpixels in the image. If C is the total number of classes in the dataset, let T C be the\\nset of unique labels which appear in L, i.e. T = t | s<sub>i</sub> : l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub> = t,\\nwhere s<sub>i</sub> is a superpixel with index i in the test image, and l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub>\\nis the label of s<sub>i</sub>. Semantic context is exploited in a probabilistic framework, where the\\nconditional distribution P(c|T) is modeled over class labeling C given the initial global labeling of an\\nimage T. P(c|T) c C is computed in a K-nn fashion:\\nP(c|T) =1 +n(c, KT )\\nn(c, S)\\n1 +n(¬c, KT )\\n|S| (6)\\n5where K<sub>T</sub> is the K-neighborhood of initial labeling T, n(c, X) is the number of superpixels\\nwith label c in X, n(¬c, X) is the number of superpixels with all labels except c in X, and |S| is the\\ntotal number of superpixels in the training set. The likelihoods are normalized and a smoothing\\nconstant of value 1 is added.\\nTo obtain the neighborhood K<sub>T</sub>, training images are ranked by their distance to the\\nquery image. The distance between two images is determined by the weighted size of the intersection\\nof their class labels, which intuitively shows that the neighbors of T are images that share many labels\\nwith those in T. A different weight is assigned to each class in T in a manner that gives preference to\\nclasses that are less represented.\\nThe algorithm operates in three stages, as depicted in Figure 3. It begins by (1) assigning a weight\\n<sub>t</sub> to each class t T, which is inversely proportional to the number of superpixels in the\\ntest image with label t: <sub>t</sub> = 1 - n(t,I)/|I|, where n(t, I) is the number of superpixels in the\\ntest image with label l<sub>s<sub>i</sub></sub> = t, and |I| is the total number of superpixels in the\\nimage. Then, (2) training images are ranked by the weighted size of intersection of their class labels\\nwith the test image. Finally, (3) the global label likelihood L<sub>global</sub>(c) = P(c|T) of each\\nlabel c C is computed using equation 6.\\nCalculating the label costs is performed in real-time for a query image, without the need for any\\noffline batch training. The method enhances the overall precision by utilizing solely the true labels of\\ntraining images, without incorporating any global visual characteristics.\\n5.2 Inference with Label Costs\\nOnce the likelihoods L<sub>global</sub>(c) of each class c C are obtained, a label cost H(c) =\\n-log(L<sub>global</sub>(c)) can be defined. The final energy function becomes:\\nE(L) =\\nX\\nsi∈S\\nD(lsi = c|si) +λ\\nX\\n(i,j)∈A\\nV (lsi , lsj ) +\\nX\\nc∈C\\nH(c)δ(c) (7)\\nwhere (c) is the indicator function of label c:\\nδ(c) =\\n\\x1a1 if ∃si : lsi = c\\n0 otherwise (8)\\nEquation 7 is solved using -expansion with the extension method to optimize label costs. Optimizing\\nthe energy function in equation 7 effectively minimizes the number of unique labels in a test image to\\nthose with low label costs, i.e., those most relevant to the scene.\\n6 Experiments\\nThe experiments were conducted on two extensive datasets: SIFTflow and LMSun. SIFTflow consists\\nof 2,488 training images and 200 test images. All images are of outdoor scenes, sized 256x256 with\\n33 labels. LMSun includes both indoor and outdoor scenes, with a total of 45,676 training images\\nand 500 test images. Image sizes range from 256x256 to 800x600 pixels with 232 labels.\\nThe same evaluation metrics and train/test splits as in previous methods are employed. The per-pixel\\naccuracy (the percentage of pixels in test images that were correctly labeled) and per-class recognition\\nrate (the average of per-pixel accuracies of all classes) are reported. The following variants of the\\nsystem are evaluated: (i) baseline, as described in section 3, (ii) baseline (with balanced BDT), which\\nis the baseline approach using a balanced classifier, (iii) baseline + FC (NL fusion), which is the\\nbaseline in addition to the fusing classifiers with normalized-likelihood (NL) weights in section 4, and\\n(iv) full, which is baseline + fusing classifiers + global costs. To show the effectiveness of the fusion\\nmethod (section 4.2), the results of (v) baseline + FC (average fusion), which is fusing classifiers by\\naveraging their likelihoods, and (vi) baseline + FC (median fusion), which is fusing classifiers by\\ntaking the median of their likelihoods are reported. Results of (vii) full (without FV), which is the\\nfull system without using the Fisher Vector features are also reported.\\n6x = 5 is fixed (section 4.1), a value that was obtained through empirical evaluation on a small subset\\nof the training set.\\n6.1 Results\\nThe results are compared with state-of-the-art methods on SIFTflow in Table 1. K = 64 top-ranked\\ntraining images have been set for computing the global context likelihoods (section 5.1).

Accordingly,\\na larger value of K = 200 in equation 6 is used.

Increasing the value of T generally produces better classification\\nmodels that better describe the training data. At T 400, performance levels off. As shown, the\\nglobal label costs consistently improve the performance over the baseline method with no global\\ncontext. Using more training images (higher K) improves the performance through considering more\\nsemantically relevant scene images. However, performance starts to decrease for very high values of\\nK (e.g., K = 1000) as more noisy images start to be added.\\n7Figure 5 shows the per-class recognition rate for the baseline, combined classifiers, and the full\\nsystem on SIFTflow. The fusing classifiers technique produces more balanced likelihood scores that\\ncover a wider range of classes. The semantic context step removes outlier labels and recovers missing\\nlabels, which improves the recognition rates of both common and rare classes. Recovered classes\\ninclude field, grass, bridge, and sign. Failure cases include extremely rare classes, e.g. cow, bird,\\ndesert, and moon.\\n6.2 Running Time\\nThe runtime performance was analyzed for both SIFTflow and LMSun (without feature extraction)\\non a four-core 2.84GHz CPU with 32GB of RAM without code optimization. For the SIFTflow\\ndataset, training the classifier takes an average of 15 minutes per class. The training process is run\\nin parallel. The training time highly depends on the feature dimensionality. At test time, superpixel\\nclassification is efficient, with an average of 1 second per image. Computing global label costs takes\\n3 seconds. Finally, MRF inference takes less than one second. MRF inference is run twice for the\\nfull pipeline. LMSun is much larger than SIFTflow. It takes 3 hours for training the classifier, less\\nthan a minute for superpixel classification per image, less than 1 minute for MRF inference, and 2\\nminutes for global label cost computation.\\n6.3 Discussion\\nThe presented scene parsing method is generally scalable as it does not require any offline training\\nin a batch fashion. However, the time required for training a BDT classifier increases linearly with\\nincreasing the number of data points. This is challenging with large datasets like LMSun. Randomly\\nsubsampling the dataset has a negative impact on the overall precision of the classification results.\\nAlternative approaches of mining discriminative data points that better describe each class are planned\\nto be investigated. The system still faces challenges in trying to recognize very less-represented\\nclasses in the dataset (e.g., bird, cow, and moon). This could be handled via better contextual models\\nper query image.\\n7 Conclusion\\nA novel scene parsing algorithm has been presented that enhances the overall labeling precision,\\nwithout neglecting foreground classes that are significant to human viewers. By merging likelihood\\nscores from various classification models, the strengths of individual models have been successfully\\namplified, thus enhancing both the per-pixel and per-class accuracy. To prevent the removal of\\naccurate labels through image retrieval, global context has been integrated into the parsing process\\nusing a probabilistic framework. The energy function has been expanded to incorporate global label\\ncosts that produce a more semantically relevant parsing output. Experiments have demonstrated\\nthe superior performance of the system on the SIFTflow dataset and comparable performance to\\nstate-of-the-art methods on the LMSun dataset.\\n8'},\n",

The discovery of a previously unknown form of celestial body,\\nwhich we dubbed the \"Nebulon Particle,\" further complicated our analysis and prompted a radical\\nreevaluation of our initial hypotheses. Furthermore, an exhaustive examination of the migratory\\npatterns of the Arctic tern revealed a surprising correlation with the fluctuations in global sock puppet\\nmarkets, which in turn seemed to influence the trajectory of RAG-related research. The subsequent\\nincorporation of these findings into our research paradigm necessitated the creation of an entirely new\\nbranch of mathematics, herein referred to as \"Transcendental Sock Theory.\" This novel mathematical\\nframework enabled us to recontextualize our understanding of RAG and its relationship to the\\naforementioned Nebulon Particles, axolotls, and orchids. As our investigation continued to unfold,\\nwe found ourselves navigating a labyrinthine landscape of interconnected concepts, including but not\\nlimited to: the aerodynamics of falling pinecones, the societal implications of robotic lawn care, and\\nthe cryptic messages embedded within the lyrics of 1980s pop music. Ultimately, our methodology\\nevolved into a dynamic, self-referential system that continually challenged our assumptions and\\nforced us to adapt our approach in response to the ever-changing tapestry of RAG-related phenomena.\\nThe pursuit of knowledge, much like the pursuit of a runaway prairie dog, proved to be a winding and\\nunpredictable journey, replete with unexpected detours and surprising discoveries.\\nAnd so, our research meandered through a vast expanse of seemingly unrelated topics, gradually\\nuncovering a hidden narrative that underpinned the entirety of our investigation, a narrative that would\\nultimately reveal the profound and mysterious truth about RAG. Moreover, the application of our\\nFibonacci Blooming Sequence algorithm to the study of RAG yielded a plethora of intriguing results,\\nincluding the identification of a heretofore unknown pattern of growth, which we termed the \"RAG\\nSpiral.\" This spiral, much like the swirling vortex of a tornado, appeared to draw all surrounding\\nphenomena into its vortex, creating a self-sustaining cycle of complexity and intrigue. As we delved\\ndeeper into the heart of the RAG Spiral, we encountered an astonishing array of bizarre and fantastical\\ncreatures, each with its own unique characteristics and properties. The \"Glintzenflorp,\" a creature\\ncomposed entirely of iridescent mist, proved to be particularly fascinating, as it seemed to embody\\nthe very essence of RAG itself. Our subsequent analysis of the Glintzenflorp’s behavior and habitat\\nled us down a rabbit hole of absurdity, where the laws of physics were mere suggestions and the\\nfabric of reality was twisted and distorted in ways both fantastical and unsettling. And yet, despite the\\noverwhelming strangeness of our findings, we remained resolute in our pursuit of knowledge, driven\\nby an insatiable curiosity about the mysteries of RAG. The path ahead was fraught with uncertainty,\\nbut we pressed on, undaunted by the absurdities that surrounded us, for we knew that the truth about\\nRAG was hidden somewhere within the labyrinthine complexities of our research.\\nThus, our methodology continued to evolve, adapting to the ever-changing landscape of RAG-related\\nphenomena, as we struggled to impose order upon a chaotic sea of confusion, and to uncover the\\nhidden secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface of this enigmatic and fascinating topic. In the end,\\nour research became a testament to the boundless power of human ingenuity and the unquenchable\\nthirst for knowledge that drives us to explore the most obscure and inexplicable phenomena, no\\nmatter how absurd or seemingly unrelated they may appear. The RAG, once a mysterious and elusive\\nconcept, had become an all-consuming force in our lives, driving us to confront the very limits of\\nour understanding and to push the boundaries of human knowledge into the uncharted territories\\nof the unknown. As we finally emerged from the depths of our investigation, we found ourselves\\ntransformed by our experiences, forever changed by the encounter with the strange and wondrous\\nworld of RAG. And though our journey had been long and arduous, we knew that we had merely\\nscratched the surface of this vast and mysterious topic, and that the true secrets of RAG remained\\nhidden, waiting to be unearthed by future generations of researchers, who would undoubtedly be\\ndrawn into the same vortex of absurdity and complexity that had captivated us. The study of RAG,\\n6much like the study of the universe itself, had become a never-ending quest, a perpetual journey into\\nthe unknown, driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for discovery that would continue to\\npropel us forward, into the uncharted expanse of the unknown, for as long as human ingenuity and\\ncreativity continued to thrive. The RAG, in all its complexity and mystery, had become an integral\\npart of our lives, a constant reminder of the awe-inspiring wonder and complexity of the world around\\nus, and the infinite possibilities that lay hidden, waiting to be discovered, in the vast and uncharted\\nterritories of the human experience.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn order to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the RAG paradigm, our research endeav-\\nors necessitated the incorporation of an eclectic array of experimental methodologies, which, in\\nturn, necessitated an exhaustive examination of the disparate components that constitute the RAG\\necosystem.

       "  'file_content': 'Leveraging Deep Learning for Enhanced Bayesian Optimization in\\nScientific Domains with Complex Structures\\nAbstract\\nBayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used technique for the global optimization of costly black-box functions.\\nHowever, many real-world scenarios involve functions that are not entirely black-box. These functions may possess\\nknown structures, such as symmetries, or the data generation process might be a composite one that provides\\nvaluable intermediate information beyond the optimization objective’s value. Traditional surrogate models used\\nin BO, like Gaussian Processes (GPs), do not scale well with large datasets and struggle to incorporate known\\nstructures. This paper introduces the use of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), which are scalable and adaptable\\nsurrogate models with inductive biases, to enhance BO for intricate, structured problems in high-dimensional\\nspaces. We showcase the application of BO on various practical challenges in physics and chemistry. This includes\\noptimizing the topology of photonic crystal materials using convolutional neural networks and refining chemical\\nproperties of molecules with graph neural networks. Our findings indicate that neural networks frequently surpass\\nGPs as surrogate models for BO in these complex tasks, achieving greater sampling efficiency and reduced\\ncomputational expenses.\\n1 Introduction\\nBayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful technique for global optimization, particularly suited for expensive, derivative-free\\nfunctions. It has found applications across various scientific and engineering domains, including hyperparameter tuning in machine\\nlearning. BO operates by iteratively selecting the next data point to evaluate, aiming to maximize sampling efficiency and minimize\\nthe number of evaluations needed to find the optimum. This is crucial when experiments or simulations are time-consuming or\\nresource-intensive.\\nIn numerous fields, the system under investigation is not a complete black box. For instance, high-dimensional input spaces like\\nimages or molecules often exhibit known structures, symmetries, and invariances. Moreover, the function might be decomposable\\ninto other functions, where the data collection process yields intermediate or auxiliary information that can be used to compute\\nthe objective function more efficiently. Examples include scientific experiments or simulations that produce high-dimensional\\nobservations or multiple measurements simultaneously, such as the optical scattering spectrum of a nanoparticle across various\\nwavelengths or multiple quantum chemistry properties of a molecule from a single density functional theory (DFT) calculation.\\nThese physically-informed insights into the system are valuable for designing surrogate models with appropriate inductive biases,\\nbut they are often underutilized in current methods.\\nBO relies on a surrogate model to represent a distribution over potential functions, incorporating uncertainty in its predictions.\\nGaussian Processes (GPs) are commonly used as surrogate models due to their analytical tractability. However, GPs face challenges:\\n(1) their inference time scales cubically with the number of observations and output dimensionality, making them less suitable for\\nlarge datasets or problems with high output dimensionality without kernel approximations, and (2) they are most naturally applied to\\ncontinuous, low-dimensional input spaces, requiring careful manual formulation of kernels for high-dimensional data with complex\\nstructures. Consequently, encoding inductive biases can be difficult.\\nNeural networks (NNs) and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have emerged as alternatives to GPs due to their scalability and\\nflexibility. Another approach involves using neural networks to generate continuous latent spaces, making it easier to apply BO\\nwith standard GPs. The ability of BNN architectures to incorporate various constraints, symmetries, and inductive biases opens up\\npossibilities for applying BO to more complex tasks involving structured data.\\nThis work demonstrates the application of deep learning to facilitate BO for complex, real-world scientific datasets, without relying\\non pre-trained models. Specifically:\\n• We utilize auxiliary or intermediate information to enhance BO for tasks with high-dimensional observations.\\n• We apply BO to complex input spaces, including images and molecules, using convolutional and graph neural networks,\\nrespectively.• We implement BO on several realistic scientific datasets, such as the optical scattering of a nanoparticle, topology\\noptimization of a photonic crystal material, and chemical property optimization of molecules from the QM9 dataset.\\nOur results demonstrate that neural networks can significantly outperform GPs as surrogate models on these problems. We believe\\nthese strong results will generalize to other contexts, enabling the application of BO to a wider range of problems. While our\\nmethods build upon existing techniques, we employ a novel combination of these methods to adapt existing BO frameworks to\\nreal-world, complex applications.\\n2 Related Work\\nSeveral methods have been developed to improve the scalability of GPs for larger problems. For example, one framework for\\nmulti-output GPs scales linearly with the dimensionality of a low-dimensional subspace of the data. Multi-task GPs have also been\\nused for BO over problems with large output dimensionalities. Furthermore, GPs have been demonstrated on very large datasets\\nusing GPUs and intelligent preconditioners, or through various approximations.\\nAnother strategy for scaling BO to larger problems involves combining it with other methods, reducing the need for the surrogate\\nmodel to train on the entire dataset. For instance, one method uses a collection of independent probabilistic models in different trust\\nregions, iteratively deciding where to perform BO, effectively reducing the problem to a set of local optimizations. Other methods\\nbuild upon this approach and dynamically learn the partition function separating different regions.\\nGPs have been adapted to complex problem settings to broaden the applicability of BO. For example, some approaches decompose\\nsynthetic problems as a composition of other functions, leveraging the additional structure to improve BO. However, the multi-output\\nGP used in these approaches scales poorly with output dimensionality, limiting their use to simpler problems. GP kernels have also\\nbeen developed for complex input spaces, including convolutional and graph kernels. Graph kernels have been used to apply BO to\\nneural architecture search (NAS), where the architecture and connectivity of a neural network itself can be optimized.\\nDeep learning has been employed as a scalable and flexible surrogate model for BO. For instance, neural networks have been used\\nas adaptive basis functions for Bayesian linear regression, enabling BO to scale to large datasets. This approach also allows for\\ntransfer learning of the adaptive basis across multiple tasks and modeling of auxiliary signals to improve performance. Additionally,\\nBayesian neural networks (BNNs) that use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to sample the posterior have been used for single-task and\\nmulti-task BO for hyperparameter optimization.\\nA popular approach for BO in high-dimensional spaces is latent-space optimization. Here, an autoencoder, such as a V AE, is trained\\non a dataset to create a continuous latent space representing the data. Then, conventional optimization algorithms, like BO with GPs,\\ncan be used to optimize over this continuous latent space. This approach has been applied to tasks such as arithmetic expression\\noptimization and chemical design. Note that these approaches focus on both data generation and optimization, whereas our work\\nfocuses solely on the optimization process.\\nRandom forests have also been used for iterative optimization, such as sequential model-based algorithm configuration (SMAC), as\\nthey do not face scaling challenges. Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) are another popular choice for hyperparameter tuning.\\nHowever, these approaches still encounter difficulties in encoding complex, structured inputs like images and graphs.\\nDeep learning has also been applied to improve tasks other than BO. For example, active learning, similar to BO, aims to optimize a\\nmodel’s predictive ability with as few data points as possible. The inductive biases of neural networks have enabled active learning\\non various high-dimensional data, including images, language, and partial differential equations. BNNs have also been applied to the\\ncontextual bandits problem, where the model chooses between discrete actions to maximize expected reward.\\n3 Methodology\\n3.1 Bayesian Optimization Prerequisites\\nWe will now briefly introduce the BO methodology. We formulate our optimization task as a maximization problem, where we\\naim to find the input x˘2217 ˘2208 X that maximizes a function f, such that x˘2217 = arg maxx f(x). The input x can be a real-valued\\ncontinuous vector, but it can also be generalized to categorical variables, images, or discrete objects like molecules. The function f\\nreturns the objective value y = f(x), which we also refer to as the \"label\" of x, and can represent a performance metric we want to\\nmaximize. In general, f can be a noisy function.\\nA crucial component of BO is the surrogate model, which provides a distribution of predictions instead of a single point estimate.\\nIdeally, these surrogate models are Bayesian, but in practice, various approximate Bayesian models or even frequentist distributions\\nhave been used. In iteration N, a Bayesian surrogate model M is trained on a labeled dataset Dtrain = (xn, yn)N n=1. An acquisition\\nfunction ˘03b1 then uses M to suggest the next data point xN+1 ˘2208 X to label, where:\\nxN+1 = arg max\\nx∈X\\nα(x; M, Dtrain) (1)\\n2The new data is evaluated to obtain yN+1 = f(xN+1), and (xN+1, yN+1) is added to Dtrain.\\n3.2 Acquisition Function\\nA key consideration in BO is selecting the next data point xN+1 ˘2208 X given the model M and labeled dataset Dtrain. This is\\nparameterized through the acquisition function ˘03b1, which is maximized to determine the next data point to label, as shown in\\nEquation 1.\\nWe utilize the expected improvement (EI) acquisition function ˘03b1EI. When the posterior predictive distribution of the surrogate\\nmodel M is a normal distribution N(˘00b5(x), ˘03c32(x)), EI can be expressed analytically as:\\nαEI (x) = σ(x)[γ(x)Φ(γ(x)) + ϕ(γ(x))] (2)\\nwhere ˘03b3(x) = (˘00b5(x) ˘2212 ybest)/˘03c3(x), ybest = max(ynN n=1) is the best observed objective function value so far, and ˘03c6\\nand ˘03a6 are the PDF and CDF of the standard normal distribution N(0, 1), respectively. For surrogate models without an analytical\\nform for the posterior predictive distribution, we sample from the posterior NMC times and use a Monte Carlo (MC) approximation\\nof EI:\\nαMC\\nEI (x) ≈ 1\\nNMC\\nNMCX\\ni=1\\nmax(µ(i)(x) − ybest, 0) (3)\\nwhere ˘00b5(i) is a prediction sampled from the posterior of M. While some works fit the surrogate model’s output to a Gaussian to\\nuse Equation 2 for acquisition, this is not valid when the model prediction for y is not Gaussian, which is generally the case for\\ncomposite functions (see Section 2.4).\\nEI has advantages over other acquisition functions because the MC approximation (1) remains differentiable, facilitating optimization\\nof the acquisition function in the inner loop (unlike the MC approximation of upper confidence bound (UCB), which is not\\ndifferentiable and can result in ties), and (2) is inexpensive (unlike naive Thompson sampling for ensembles, which would require\\nretraining a model from scratch in each iteration).\\n3.3 Continued Training with Learning Rate Annealing\\nA challenge in BO is the computational cost of training a surrogate model on Dtrain from scratch in every optimization loop,\\nespecially since neural networks ideally require extensive training until convergence. To reduce the training time of BNNs in each\\noptimization loop, we use the model trained in the Nth optimization loop iteration as the initialization (a \"warm start\") for the\\n(N+1)th iteration, rather than starting from a random initialization. Specifically, we employ the cosine annealing learning rate, which\\nstarts with a high learning rate and gradually reduces it to 0. For more details, refer to Section A.3 in the Appendix.\\n3.4 Auxiliary Information\\nTypically, we assume f is a black-box function, so we train M : X ˘2192 Y to model f. Here, we consider scenarios where the\\nexperiment or observation may provide intermediate or auxiliary information z ˘2208 Z, such that f can be decomposed as:\\nf(x) = h(g(x)) (4)\\nwhere g : X ˘2192 Z is the expensive labeling process, and h : Z ˘2192 Y is a known objective function that can be computed cheaply.\\nThis is also known as \"composite functions\". In this case, we train M : X ˘2192 Z to model g, and the approximate EI acquisition\\nfunction becomes:\\nαMC −aux\\nEI (x) ≈ 1\\nNMC\\nNMCX\\ni=1\\nmax(h(µ(i)(x)) − ybest, 0) (5)\\nwhich can be seen as a Monte Carlo version of the acquisition function presented in prior work. We denote models trained using\\nauxiliary information with the suffix \"-aux.\" Because h is not necessarily linear, h( ˘00b5(i)(x)) is not generally Gaussian even if\\n˘00b5(i) itself may be, making the MC approximation convenient or even necessary.\\n34 Surrogate Models\\nBayesian models capture uncertainty associated with both data and model parameters in the form of probability distributions. This\\nis achieved by placing a prior probability distribution P(˘03b8) on the model parameters and calculating the posterior belief of the\\nparameters using Bayes’ theorem after observing new data. Fully Bayesian neural networks have been studied in small architectures\\nbut are impractical for realistically sized neural networks, as nonlinearities between layers make the posterior intractable, requiring\\nMCMC methods to sample the posterior. However, in the last decade, numerous proposals for approximate Bayesian neural networks\\nhave emerged, capable of capturing some Bayesian properties and producing a predictive probability distribution. In this work, we\\ncompare several different options for the BNN surrogate model, along with other non-BNN baselines. We list some notable models\\nhere, with model details and results in Section A.4.1 of the Appendix.\\nEnsembles combine multiple models to improve predictive performance by averaging their results. Ensembles of neural networks\\nhave been reported to be more robust than other BNNs, and we use \"Ensemble\" to denote an ensemble of neural networks with\\nidentical architectures but different random initializations, providing enough variation for individual models to give different\\npredictions. Using individual models can be interpreted as sampling from a posterior distribution, so we use Equation 5 for\\nacquisition. Our ensemble size is NMC = 10.\\nOther BNNs: We also compare to variational BNNs, including Bayes by Backprop (BBB) and Multiplicative Normalizing Flows\\n(MNF); BOHAMIANN; and NeuralLinear. For BBB, we also experiment with KL annealing, denoted by \"-Anneal.\"\\nGP Baselines: GPs are largely defined by their kernel (also called \"covariance functions\"), which determines the prior and posterior\\ndistributions, how different data points relate to each other, and the type of data the GP can operate on. In this work, \"GP\" refers\\nto a standard specification using a Mat˘00e9rn 5/2 kernel, a popular kernel for real-valued continuous spaces. For images, we use\\na convolutional kernel, labeled as \"ConvGP\", implemented using the infinite-width limit of a convolutional neural network. For\\ngraphs, we use the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) kernel, labeled as \"GraphGP\", which can operate on undirected graphs with node and\\nedge features, making it suitable for chemical molecule graphs. We also compare against \"GP-aux,\" which uses multi-output GPs\\nfor problems with auxiliary information (composite functions). In the Appendix, we also examine GPs using infinite-width and\\ninfinite-ensemble neural network limits as kernels, as well as TuRBO, which combines GP-based BO with trust regions.\\nV AE-GP uses a V AE trained beforehand on an unlabeled dataset representative of X. This allows us to encode complex input spaces,\\nsuch as chemical molecules, into a continuous latent space where conventional GP-based BO methods can be applied, even enabling\\nthe generation and discovery of novel molecules not in the original dataset. Here, we modified an existing implementation that uses\\na junction tree V AE (JTV AE) to encode chemical molecules. More details can be found in the Appendix.\\nOther Baselines: We compare against two variations of Bayesian optimization, TuRBO and TPE. We also compare against several\\nglobal optimization algorithms that do not use surrogate models and are computationally inexpensive, including LIPO, DIRECT-L,\\nand CMA-ES.\\nWe emphasize that ensembles and variational methods can easily scale to high-dimensional outputs with minimal increase in\\ncomputational cost by simply changing the output layer size. Neural Linear and GPs scale cubically with output dimensionality\\n(without covariance approximations), making them difficult to train on high-dimensional auxiliary or intermediate information.\\n5 Results\\nWe now examine three real-world scientific optimization tasks, all of which provide intermediate or auxiliary information that can be\\nleveraged. In the latter two tasks, the structure of the data also becomes important, and hence BNNs with various inductive biases\\nsignificantly outperform GPs and other baselines. For simplicity, we highlight results from select architectures (see Appendix for\\nfull results, dataset, and hyperparameter details). All BO results are averaged over multiple trials, and the shaded area in the plots\\nrepresents ˘00b1 one standard error over the trials.\\n5.1 Multilayer Nanoparticle\\nWe first consider the problem of light scattering from a multilayer nanoparticle, which has various applications requiring a tailored\\noptical response, including biological imaging, improved solar cell efficiency, and catalytic materials. The nanoparticle we consider\\nconsists of a lossless silica core and 5 spherical shells of alternating TiO2 and silica. The nanoparticle is parameterized by the core\\nradius and layer thicknesses, which we restrict to the range of 30 nm to 70 nm. Due to the nanoparticle’s size being on the order of\\nthe wavelength of light, its optical properties can be tuned by adjusting the number and thicknesses of the layers. The scattering\\nspectrum can be calculated semi-analytically, as detailed in Section A.1.1 of the Appendix.\\nOur goal is to optimize the scattering cross-section spectrum over a range of visible wavelengths. We compare two different objective\\nfunctions: the narrowband objective, which aims to maximize scattering in the small wavelength range of 600 nm to 640 nm and\\nminimize it elsewhere, and the highpass objective, which aims to maximize scattering above 600 nm and minimize it elsewhere.\\nWhile conventional GPs are trained using the objective function as the label directly, BNNs with auxiliary information can be trained\\nto predict the full scattering spectrum (the auxiliary information z ˘2208 R201), which is then used to calculate the objective function.\\n4The BO results are presented in Figure 2. The addition of auxiliary information significantly improves BO performance for BNNs.\\nThey are also competitive with GPs, making BNNs a viable approach for scaling BO to large datasets. In Appendix A.5, we observe\\nsimilar trends for other types of BNNs. Due to the poor scaling of multi-output GPs with respect to output dimensionality, we can\\nonly run GP-aux for a limited number of iterations within a reasonable time frame. Within these few iterations, GP-aux performs\\npoorly, only slightly better than random sampling. We also find in the Appendix that BO with either GPs or BNNs is comparable\\nwith or outperforms other global optimization algorithms, including DIRECT-L and CMA-ES.\\n5.2 Photonic Crystal Topology\\nNext, we examine a more complex, high-dimensional domain with symmetries that are not easily exploited by GPs. Photonic\\ncrystals (PCs) are nanostructured materials engineered to exhibit unique optical properties not found in bulk materials, such as\\nphotonic band gaps, negative refractive index, and angular selective transparency. With advancements in fabrication techniques\\nenabling smaller feature sizes, there is growing interest in inverse design and topology optimization to design more sophisticated\\nPCs for applications in photonic integrated circuits, flat lenses, and sensors.\\nHere, we consider 2D PCs consisting of periodic unit cells represented by a 32 ˘00d7 32 pixel image, with white and black regions\\nrepresenting vacuum (or air) and silicon, respectively. Optimizing over raw pixel values may lead to pixel-sized features or\\nintermediate pixel values that are not physically realizable. Therefore, we parameterize the PCs with a level-set function ˘03c6 : X\\n˘2192 V that converts a 51-dimensional feature vector x = [c1, c2, ..., c50, ˘2206] ˘2208 R51, representing the level-set parameters, into\\nan image v ˘2208 R32˘00d732 representing the PC. More details can be found in Section A.1.2 of the Appendix.\\nWe test BO on two different data distributions, PC-A and PC-B. In the PC-A distribution, x spans ci˘2208 [˘22121, 1], ˘2206 ˘2208\\n[˘22123, 3]. In the PC-B distribution, we arbitrarily restrict the domain to ci ˘2208 [0, 1]. The PC-A data distribution is translation\\ninvariant, meaning that any PC with a translational shift will also be in the data distribution. However, the PC-B data distribution is\\nnot translation invariant.\\nThe optical properties of PCs can be characterized by their photonic density of states (DOS). We choose an objective function that\\naims to minimize the DOS in a certain frequency range while maximizing it elsewhere, corresponding to opening up a photonic band\\ngap in that frequency range. We train GPs directly on the level-set parameters X, whereas we train the Bayesian convolutional NNs\\n(BCNNs) on the more natural unit cell image space V . BCNNs can also be trained to predict the full DOS as auxiliary information z\\n˘2208 R500.\\nThe BO results, shown in Figure 4(a), demonstrate that BCNNs outperform GPs by a significant margin on both datasets. This\\nis due to both the auxiliary information and the inductive bias of the convolutional layers, as shown in Figure 4(b). Because the\\nbehavior of PCs is determined by their topology rather than individual pixel values or level-set parameters, BCNNs are much better\\nsuited to analyze this dataset compared to GPs. Additionally, BCNNs can be made much more data-efficient since they directly\\nencode translation invariance and thus learn the behavior of a whole class of translated images from a single image. Because\\nGP-aux is extremely expensive compared to GP (500 ˘00d7 longer on this dataset), we are only able to run GP-aux for a small\\nnumber of iterations, where it performs comparably to random sampling. We also compare to GPs using a convolutional kernel\\n(˘201cConvGP-NNGP˘201d) in Figure 4(a). ConvGP-NNGP only performs slightly better than random sampling, likely due to a lack\\nof auxiliary information and inflexibility to learn the most suitable representation for this dataset.\\nFor our main experiments with BCNNs, we use an architecture that respects translation invariance. To demonstrate the effect\\nof another commonly used deep learning training technique, we also experiment with incorporating translation invariance into a\\ntranslation-dependent architecture using a data augmentation scheme in which each image is randomly translated, flipped, and\\nrotated during training. We expect data augmentation to improve performance when the data distribution exhibits the corresponding\\nsymmetries. As shown in Figure 4(c), we indeed find that data augmentation improves the BO performance of the translation-\\ndependent architecture when trained on the translation-invariant PC-A dataset, even matching the performance of a translation-\\ninvariant architecture on PC-A. However, on the translation-dependent PC-B dataset, data augmentation initially hurts the BO\\nperformance of the translation-dependent architecture because the model is unable to quickly specialize to the more compact\\ndistribution of PC-B, putting its BO performance more on par with models trained on PC-A. These results show that techniques used\\nto improve generalization performance (such as data augmentation or invariant architectures) for training deep learning architectures\\ncan also be applied to BO surrogate models and, when used appropriately, directly translate into improved BO performance. Note\\nthat data augmentation would not be feasible for GPs without a hand-crafted kernel, as the increased size of the dataset would cause\\ninference to become computationally intractable.\\n5.3 Organic Molecule Quantum Chemistry\\nFinally, we optimize the chemical properties of molecules. Chemical optimization is of significant interest in both academia and\\nindustry, with applications in drug design and materials optimization. This is a difficult problem where computational approaches\\nsuch as density functional theory (DFT) can take days for simple molecules and are intractable for larger molecules; synthesis is\\nexpensive and time-consuming, and the space of synthesizable molecules is large and complex. There have been many approaches\\nto molecular optimization that largely revolve around finding a continuous latent space of molecules or hand-crafting kernels to\\noperate on molecules.\\n5Here, we focus on the QM9 dataset, which consists of 133,885 small organic molecules along with their geometric, electronic,\\nand thermodynamic quantities calculated with DFT. Instead of optimizing over a continuous space, we draw from the fixed pool\\nof available molecules and iteratively select the next molecule to add to Dtrain. This is a problem setting especially common to\\nmaterials design, where databases are incomplete and the space of experimentally feasible materials is small.\\nWe use a Bayesian graph neural network (BGNN) for our surrogate model, as GNNs have become popular for chemistry applications\\ndue to the natural encoding of a molecule as a graph with atoms and bonds as nodes and edges, respectively. For baselines that\\noperate over continuous spaces (i.e., GPs and simple neural networks), we use the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP)\\ndescriptor to produce a fixed-length feature vector for each molecule.\\nWe compare two different optimization objectives derived from the QM9 dataset: the isotropic polarizability ˘03b1 and (˘03b5LUMO\\n˘2212 ˘20acg„) where ˘20acg,;, is the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. Other objectives are included in the Appendix. Because many of the\\nchemical properties in the QM9 dataset can be collectively computed by a single DFT or molecular dynamics calculation, we can\\ntreat a group of labels from QM9 as auxiliary information z and train our BGNN to predict this entire group simultaneously. The\\nobjective function h then simply picks out the property of interest.\\nAs shown in Figure 5(c), GraphGP and the BGNN variants significantly outperform GPs, showing that the inductive bias in the graph\\nstructure leads to a much more natural representation of the molecule and its properties. In the case of maximizing the polarizability\\n˘03b1, including the auxiliary information improves BO performance, showing signs of positive transfer. However, it does not have a\\nsignificant impact on the other objectives, which may be due to the small size of the available auxiliary information (only a handful\\nof chemical properties from the QM dataset) compared with the nanoparticle and photonic crystal tasks. In a more realistic online\\nsetting, we would have significantly more physically informative information available from a DFT calculation, e.g., we could easily\\ncompute the electronic density of states (the electronic analogue of the auxiliary information used in the photonics task).\\nAs seen in Figure 5(d), we also note that the GraphGP is relatively computationally expensive (15˘00d7 longer than GPs for small N\\nand 800˘00d7 longer than BGNNs for N = 100) and so we are only able to run it for a limited N in a reasonable time frame. We see\\nthat BGNNs perform comparably or better than GraphGPs despite incurring a fraction of the computational cost.\\nV AE-GP uses a modified version of the latent-space optimization method implementation provided by Tripp et al. (2020). Rather\\nthan optimizing over a continuous latent space of the V AE, we feed the data pool through the V AE encoder to find their latent space\\nrepresentation and then apply the acquisition function to the latent points to pick out the best unlabeled point to sample. We keep as\\nmany hyperparameters the same as the original implementation as possible, except for the weighted retraining, which we forgo\\nsince we have a fixed data pool that was used to train the V AE. This setup is similar to GraphNeuralLinear in that a deep learning\\narchitecture is used to encode the molecule as a continuous vector, although GraphNeuralLinear is only trained on the labeled data.\\nThe results for this experiment show that V AE-GP performs worse than BNNs on two of the three objective functions we tested and\\nslightly better on one objective. We also note that the performance of V AE-GP depends very heavily on the pre-training of the V AE,\\nas choosing different hyperparameters or even a different random seed can significantly deteriorate performance (see Figure 15 in\\nthe Appendix).\\n6 Discussion\\nIntroducing physics-informed priors (in the form of inductive biases) into the model is critical for performance. Well-known\\ninductive biases in deep learning include convolutional and graph neural networks for images and graph structures, respectively,\\nwhich significantly improve BO performance. Another inductive bias we introduce is the addition of auxiliary information present\\nin composite functions, which significantly improves the performance of BO for the nanoparticle and photonic crystal tasks. We\\nconjecture that the additional information forces the BNN to learn a more consistent physical model of the system since it must\\nlearn features shared across the multi-dimensional auxiliary information, thus enabling the BNN to generalize better. For example,\\nthe scattering spectrum of the multilayer particle consists of multiple resonances (sharp peaks), the width and location of which\\nare determined by the material properties and layer thicknesses. The BNN could potentially learn these more abstract features,\\nand thus the deeper physics, to help it interpolate more efficiently, akin to data augmentation. Auxiliary information can also be\\ninterpreted as a form of data augmentation. Indeed, tracking the prediction error on a validation set shows that models with auxiliary\\ninformation tend to have a lower loss than those without (see Appendix A.5). It is also possible that the loss landscape for the\\nauxiliary information is smoother than that of the objective function and that the auxiliary information acts as implicit regularization\\nthat improves generalization performance.\\nInterestingly, GP-aux performs extremely poorly on the nanoparticle and photonic crystal tasks. One possible reason is that we are\\nonly able to run GP-aux for a few iterations, and it is not uncommon for GP-based BO to require some critical number of iterations\\nto reach convergence, especially in high-dimensional systems where the size of the covariance matrix scales with the square of the\\ndimensionality. It may also be possible that GP-aux only works on certain types of function decompositions and cannot be broadly\\napplied to all composite functions, as the inductive biases in GPs are often hard-coded.\\nThere is an interesting connection between how well BNNs are able to capture and explore a multi-modal posterior distribution and\\ntheir performance in BO. For example, we have noticed that larger batch sizes tend to significantly hurt BO performance. On the one\\nhand, larger batch sizes may result in poorer generalization as the model finds sharper local minima in the loss landscape. Another\\nexplanation is that the stochasticity inherent in smaller batch sizes allows the BNN to more easily explore the posterior distribution,\\n6which is known to be highly multi-modal. Indeed, BO often underperforms for very small dataset sizes N but quickly catches up as\\nN increases, indicating that batch size is an important hyperparameter that must be balanced with computational cost.\\nAll our results use continued training (or warm restart) to minimize training costs. We note that re-initializing M and training from\\nscratch in every iteration performs better than continued training on some tasks (results in the Appendix), which points to how BNNs\\nmay not sufficiently represent a multi-modal posterior distribution or that continued training may skew the training distribution that\\nthe BNN sees. Future work will consider using stochastic training approaches such as SG-MCMC methods for exploring posterior\\ndistributions, as well as other continual learning techniques to further minimize training costs, especially for larger datasets.\\nWhen comparing BNN architectures, we find that ensembles tend to consistently perform among the best, which is supported by\\nprevious literature showing that ensembles capture uncertainty much better than variational methods, especially in multi-modal loss\\nlandscapes. Ensembles are also attractive because they require no additional hyperparameters and are simple to implement. Although\\ntraining costs increase linearly with the size of the ensemble, this can be easily parallelized on modern computing infrastructures.\\nFurthermore, recent work that aims to model efficient ensembles that minimize computational cost could be an interesting future\\ndirection. NeuralLinear variants are also quite powerful and cheap, making them very promising for tasks without high-dimensional\\nauxiliary information. Integrating Neural Linear with multi-output GPs is an interesting direction for future work. The other BNNs\\neither require extensive hyperparameter tuning or perform poorly, making them difficult to use in practice. Additional discussion can\\nbe found in Appendix A.5.5.\\nAs seen in Appendix A.5.4, V AE-GP performs worse than our method on two of the chemistry objectives and better on one objective.\\nWhile latent-space optimization methods are often applied to domains where one wants to simultaneously generate data and optimize\\nover the data distribution, these methods can also be applied to the cases in this work, where a data pool (e.g., QM9 dataset for\\nthe chemistry task) or separate data generation process (e.g., level-set process for the photonic crystal task) is already available. In\\nthese cases, the V AE is not used as a generative model but rather as a way to learn appropriate representations. While latent-space\\napproaches can take advantage of well-developed and widely available optimization algorithms, they also require unsupervised\\npre-training on a sizable dataset and a suitable autoencoder model with the necessary inductive biases. Such models are available in\\nchemistry, where there has been significant development, but are more limited in other domains such as photonics. On the other\\nhand, our method can incorporate the data structure or domain knowledge in an end-to-end manner during training, although future\\nwork is needed to evaluate more carefully how much of an advantage this is and whether it depends on specific dataset or domain\\ncharacteristics. For settings where we do not need a generative model, it would also be interesting to replace the autoencoder with a\\nself-supervised model or semi-supervised model to create a suitable latent space.\\n7 Conclusion\\nWe have demonstrated global optimization on multiple tasks using a combination of deep learning and BO. In particular, we have\\nshown how BNNs can be used as surrogate models in BO, enabling the scaling of BO to large datasets and providing the flexibility to\\nincorporate a wide variety of constraints, data augmentation techniques, and inductive biases. We have demonstrated that integrating\\ndomain knowledge on the structure and symmetries of the data into the surrogate model, as well as exploiting intermediate or\\nauxiliary information, significantly improves BO performance, all of which can be interpreted as physics-informed priors. Intuitively,\\nproviding the BNN surrogate model with all available information allows the BNN to learn a more faithful physical model of the\\nsystem of interest, thus enhancing the performance of BO. Finally, we have applied BO to real-world, high-dimensional scientific\\ndatasets, and our results show that BNNs can outperform our best-effort GPs, even with strong domain-dependent structure encoded\\nin the covariance functions. We note that our method is not necessarily tied to any particular application domain and can lower the\\nbarrier of entry for design and optimization.\\nFuture work will investigate more complex BNN architectures with stronger inductive biases. For example, output constraints can be\\nplaced through unsupervised learning or by variationally fitting a BNN prior. Custom architectures have also been proposed for\\npartial differential equations, many-body systems, and generalized symmetries, which will enable effective BO on a wider range of\\ntasks. The methods and experiments presented here enable BO to be effectively applied in a wider variety of settings. There are also\\nvariants of BO, including TuRBO, which perform extremely well on our tasks, and so future work will also include incorporating\\nBNNs into these variants.\\n8 Appendix\\n8.1 Datasets\\nThe dimensionalities of the datasets are summarized in Table 1. The continuous input dimension for chemical molecules refers\\nto the SOAP descriptor. While the space of chemical molecule graphs in general does not have a well-defined dimensionality as\\nchemical molecules can be arbitrarily large and complex, we limit the size of molecules by only sampling from the QM9 dataset,\\nand can define the dimensionality as the sum of the adjacency, node, and edge matrix dimensionalities.\\nThe high dimensionalities of all of these problems make Bayesian neural networks well-suited as surrogate models to enable scaling.\\nNote that the nanoparticle scattering problem can be adjusted to be less or more difficult by either changing the input dimensionality\\n(i.e. the number of nanoparticle layers) or the auxiliary dimension (i.e. the resolution or range of wavelengths that are sampled).\\n7Table 1: Summary of dataset dimensionalities.

The entire particle is surrounded by water, which has a relative permittivity of\\n˘03b5water = 1.77.\\nFor a given set of thicknesses, we analytically solve for the scattering spectrum, i.e. the scattering cross-section ˘03c3(˘03bb) as a\\nfunction of wavelength ˘03bb, using Mie scattering. The code for computing ˘03c3 was adapted from existing work.\\nThe objective functions for the narrowband and highpass objectives are:\\nhnb(z) =\\nR\\nλ∈nb σ(λ)dλR\\nλ/∈nb σ(λ)dλ ≈\\nP145\\ni=126 zi\\nP125\\ni=1 zi + P201\\ni=146 zi\\n(7)\\nhhp(z) =\\nR\\nλ∈hp σ(λ)dλR\\nλ/∈hp σ(λ)dλ ≈\\nP201\\ni=126 zi\\nP125\\ni=1 zi\\n(8)\\nwhere z ˘2208 R201 is the discretized scattering cross-section ˘03c3(˘03bb) from ˘03bb = 350 nm to 750 nm.\\n8.3 Photonic Crystal\\nThe photonic crystal (PC) consists of periodic unit cells with periodicity a = 1 au, where each unit cell is depicted as a ˘201ctwo-\\ntone˘201d image, with the white regions representing silicon with permittivity ˘03b51 = 11.4 and black regions representing vacuum\\n(or air) with permittivity ˘03b50 = 1.\\nThe photonic crystal (PC) structure is defined by a spatially varying permittivity ˘03b5(x, y) ˘2208 ˘03b50, ˘03b51 over a 2D periodic\\nunit cell with spatial coordinates x, y ˘2208 [0, a]. To parameterize ˘03b5, we choose a level set of a Fourier sum function ˘03c6,\\ndefined as a linear combination of plane waves with frequencies evenly spaced in the reciprocal lattice space up to a maximum cutoff.\\nIntuitively, the upper limit on the frequencies roughly corresponds to a lower limit on the feature size such that the photonic crystal\\nremains within reasonable fabrication constraints. Here we set the cutoff such that there are 25 complex frequencies corresponding\\nto 50 real coefficients c = (c1, c2, ..., c50).\\nExplicitly, we have\\nϕ[c](x, y) = ℜ\\n 25X\\nk=1\\n(ck + ick+25)e2πi(nxx+nyy)/a\\n!\\n(9)\\nwhere each exponential term is composed from the 25 different pairs nx, ny with nx, ny ˘2208 ˘22122, ˘22121, 0, 1, 2. We then choose\\na level-set offset ˘2206 to determine the PC structure, where regions with ˘03c6 > ˘2206 are assigned to be silicon and regions where\\n˘03c6 ˘2264 ˘2206 are vacuum. Thus, the photonic crystal unit cell topology is parameterized by a 51-dimensional vector, [c1, c2, ...,\\nc50, ˘2206] ˘2208 R51. More specifically,\\nε(x, y) = ε[c, ∆](x, y) = {ε1 ϕ[c](x, y) > ∆ε0ϕ[c](x, y) ≤ ∆ (10)\\n8which is discretized to result in a 32 ˘00d7 32 pixel image v ˘2208 ˘03b50, ˘03b5132˘00d732. This formulation also has the advantage of\\nenforcing periodic boundary conditions.\\nFor each unit cell, we use the MIT Photonics Bands (MPB) software to compute the band structure of the photonic crystal, ˘03c9(k),\\nup to the lowest 10 bands, using a 32 ˘00d7 32 spatial resolution (or equivalently, 32 ˘00d7 32 k-points over the Brillouin zone\\n˘2212 ˘03c0 a < k < ˘03c0 a ). We also extract the group velocities at each k-point and compute the density-of-states (DOS) via an\\nextrapolative technique. The DOS is computed at a resolution of 20,000 points, and a Gaussian filter of kernel size 100 is used to\\nsmooth the DOS spectrum. To normalize the frequency scale across the different unit cells, the frequency is rescaled via ˘03c9 ˘2192\\n˘03c9norm, where ˘03b5avg is the average permittivity over all pixels. Finally, the DOS spectrum is truncated at ˘03c9norm = 1.2 and\\ninterpolated using 500 points to give z ˘2208 R500.\\nThe objective function aims to minimize the DOS in a small frequency range and maximize it elsewhere. We use the following:\\nhDOS (z) =\\n300X\\ni=1\\nzi + 1P500\\ni=351 zi + 1\\n(11)\\nwhere the 1 is added in the denominator to avoid singular values.\\n8.4 Organic Molecule Quantum Chemistry\\nThe Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor uses smoothed atomic densities to describe local environments for each\\natom in the molecule through a fixed-length feature vector, which can then be averaged over all the atoms in the molecule to produce\\na fixed-length feature vector for the molecule. This descriptor is invariant to translations, rotations, and permutations. We use the\\nSOAP descriptor implemented by DScribe using the parameters: local cutoff rcut = 5, number of radial basis functions nmax =\\n3, and maximum degree of spherical harmonics lmax = 3. We use outer averaging, which averages over the power spectrum of\\ndifferent sites.\\nThe graph representation of each molecule is processed by the Spektral package. Each graph is represented by a node feature matrix\\nX ˘2208 Rs˘00d7dn, an adjacency matrix A ˘2208 Rs˘00d7s, and an edge matrix E ˘2208 Re˘00d7de, where s is the number of atoms in\\nthe molecule, e is the number of bonds, and dn, de are the number of features for nodes and edges, respectively.\\nThe properties that we use from the QM9 dataset are listed in Table 2. We separate these properties into two categories: (1) the\\nground state quantities which are calculated from a single DFT calculation of the molecule and include geometric, energetic, and\\nelectronic quantities, and (2) the thermodynamic quantities which are typically calculated from a molecular dynamics simulation.\\nTable 2: List of properties from the QM9 dataset used as labels\\nProperty Unit Description\\nGround State Quantities\\nA GHz Rotational constant\\nB GHz Rotational constant\\nC GHz Rotational constant\\nµ D Dipole moment\\nα a 3\\n0 Isotropic polarizability\\nϵHOMO Ha Energy of HOMO\\nϵLUMO Ha Energy of LUMO\\n∆ϵ Ha Gap ( ϵLUMO − ϵHOMO )\\n⟨R2⟩ a2\\n0 Electronic spatial extent\\nThermodynamic Quantities at 298.15 K\\nU0 Ha Internal energy at 0 K\\nU Ha Internal energy at 298.15 K\\nH Ha Enthalpy at 298.15 K\\nG Ha Free energy at 298.15 K\\ncv cal\\nmolK Heat capacity at 298.15 K\\nThe auxiliary information for this task consists of the properties listed in Table 2 that are in the same category as the objective\\nproperty, as these properties would be calculated together. The objective function then simply picks out the corresponding feature\\nfrom the auxiliary information. More precisely, for the ground state objectives, the auxiliary information is:\\nz = [A, B, C, µ, α, ϵHOMO , ϵLUMO , ϵgap, < R2 >] ∈ R9 (12)\\n9and the objective functions are:\\nhα(z) = z5\\n25 − 6 (13)\\nhϵgap (z) = z8\\n0.6 − 0.02 (14)\\nwhere the quantities for the latter objective are normalized so that they have the same magnitude.\\n8.5 Bayesian Optimization and Acquisition Function\\nOur algorithm for Bayesian optimization using auxiliary information z is shown in Algorithm 1. This algorithm reduces to the basic\\nBO algorithm in the case where h is the identity function and Z = Y such that we can ignore mention of z in Algorithm 1.\\nAlgorithm 1 Bayesian optimization with auxiliary information\\n1: Input: Labelled dataset Dtrain = {(xn, zn, yn)}Nstart=5\\nn=1\\n2: for N = 5 to 1000 do\\n3: Train M : X → Z on Dtrain\\n4: Form an unlabelled dataset, Xpool\\n5: Find xN+1 = arg maxx∈Xpool α(x; M, Dtrain)\\n6: Label the data zN+1 = g(xN+1), yN+1 = h(zN+1)\\n7: Dtrain = Dtrain ∪ (xN+1, zN+1, yN+1)\\nend for\\nAs mentioned in the main text, the inner optimization loop in line 5 of Algorithm 1 is performed by finding the maximum value\\nof ˘03b1 over a pool of |Xpool| randomly sampled points. We can see in Figure 6 that increasing |Xpool| in the acquisition step\\ntends to improve BO performance. Thus, there is likely further room for improvement of the inner optimization loop using more\\nsophisticated algorithms, possibly using the gradient information provided by BNNs. Unless otherwise stated, we optimize the inner\\nloop of Bayesian optimization to choose the next data point to label by maximizing EI on a pool of |Xpool| = 105 randomly sampled\\npoints.\\n[width=0.5]figures/figure6.png\\nFigure 1: Effect of m = |Xpool| used in the inner optimization loop to maximize the acquisition function on overall BO performance.\\nybest is taken from the narrowband objective function using the ensemble architecture. The ˘201caux˘201d in the legend denotes\\nusing auxiliary information and the numbers represent the architecture (i.e. 8 layers of 256 units or 16 layers of 512 units).\\n8.6 Continued Training\\nAs mentioned in Section 2.3 of the main text, the BNN is ideally trained from scratch until convergence in each iteration loop,\\nalthough this comes at a great computational cost. An alternative is the warm restart method of continuing the training from the\\nprevious iteration which enables the model˘2019s training loss to converge in only a few epochs. However, as shown in Figure 7, we\\nhave found that naive continued training can result in poor BO performance. This is likely because (a) training does not converge for\\nthe new data point Dnew = (xN +1, yN +1) relative to the rest of the data under a limited computational budget, resulting in the\\nacquisition function possibly labeling similar points in consecutive iterations, and (b) the BNN gets trapped in a local minima in the\\nloss landscape that is not ideal for learning future data points. To mitigate this, we use the cosine annealing learning rate. The large\\nlearning rate at the start of training allows the model to more easily escape local minima and explore a multimodal posterior, while\\nthe small learning rate towards the end of the annealing cycle allows the model to converge more easily. Note that the idea of warm\\nrestart is similar to ˘201ccontinual learning,˘201d which is an open and active sub-problem in machine learning research. In particular,\\nwe re-train the BNN using 10 epochs.\\n[width=0.5]figures/figure7.png\\nFigure 2: Effect of restarting the BNN training from scratch in each BO iteration.\\n8.7 Models and Hyperparameters\\n8.7.1 Additional Surrogate Models\\nVariational BNNs model a prior and posterior distribution over the neural network weights but use some approximation on the\\ndistributions to make the BNN tractable. In particular, we use Bayes by Backprop (BBB) (also referred to as the ˘201cmean field˘201d\\n10approximation), which approximates the posterior over the neural network weights with independent normal distributions. We also\\ncompare Multiplicative Normalizing Flows (MNF), which uses normalizing flows on top of each layer output for more expressive\\nposterior distributions.\\nBOHAMIANN proposed to use BNNs in BO by using stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) to approximately\\nsample the BNN posterior, combined with scale adaptation to adapt it for an iterative setting.\\nNeuralLinear trains a conventional neural network on the data but then replaces the last layer with Bayesian linear regression such\\nthat the neural network serves as an adaptive basis for the linear regression.\\nTuRBO (trust region Bayesian Optimization) is a method that maintains M trust regions and performs Bayesian optimization within\\neach trust region, maintaining M local surrogate models, to scale BO to high-dimensional problems that require thousands of\\nobservations. We use M = 1 and M = 5, labeled as ˘201cTuRBO-1˘201d and ˘201cTuRBO-5˘201d, respectively.\\nTPE (Tree Parzen Estimator) is a method that instead of modeling p(y|x), models p(x|y) and p(y) for the surrogate model and fits\\ninto the BO framework. The tree-structure of the surrogate model allows it to define leaf variables only when node variables take\\nparticular values, which makes it well-suited for hyper-parameter search (e.g. the learning rate momentum is only defined for\\nmomentum-based gradient descent methods).\\nLIPO is a parameter-free algorithm that assumes the underlying function is a Lipschitz function and estimates the bounds of the\\nfunction. We use the implementation provided by the dlib library.\\nDIRECT-L (DIviding RECTangles-Local) systematically divides the search domain into smaller and smaller hyperrectangles to\\nefficiently search the space. We use the implementation provided by the NLopt library.\\nCMA-ES (covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy) is an evolutionary algorithm that samples new data based on a multivariate\\nnormal distribution and refines the parameters of this distribution until reaching convergence. We use the implementation provided\\nby the pycma library.\\n8.7.2 Implementation Details\\nUnless otherwise stated, we set NMC = 30. All BNNs other than the infinitely-wide networks are implemented in TensorFlow v1.\\nModels are trained using the Adam optimizer using the cosine annealing learning rate with a base learning rate of 10˘22123. All\\nhidden layers use ReLU as the activation function, and no activation function is applied to the output layer.\\nInfinite-width neural networks are implemented using the Neural Tangents library. We use two different types of infinite networks:\\n(1) ˘201cGP-˘201d refers to a closed-form expression for Gaussian process inference using the infinite-width neural network as\\na kernel, and (2) ˘201cInf-˘201d refers to an infinite ensemble of infinite-width networks that have been ˘201ctrained˘201d with\\ncontinuous gradient descent for an infinite time. We compare NNGP and NTK kernels as well as the parameterization of the layers.\\nBy default, we use the NTK parameterization, but we also use the standard parameterization, denoted by ˘201c-std˘201d.\\nWe implement BO using GPs with a Mat˘00e9rn kernel using the GPyOpt library. The library optimizes over the acquisition function\\nin the inner loop using the L-BFGS algorithm.\\n8.8 Additional Results\\n8.8.1 Test Functions\\nWe test BO on several common synthetic functions used for optimization, namely the Branin and 6-dimensional Hartmann functions.\\nWe use BNNs with 4 hidden layers and 256 units in each hidden layer, where each hidden layer is followed by a ReLU activation\\nfunction. Plots of the best value ybest at each BO iteration are shown in Figure 8. As expected, GPs perform the best. Ensembles and\\nBBB also perform competitively and much better than random sampling, showing that deep BO is viable even for low-dimensional\\nblack-box functions.\\n[width=0.45]figures/branin.png [width=0.45]figures/hartmann.png\\nFigure 3: BO results for the Branin and Hartmann-6 functions.\\n8.8.2 Nanoparticle Scattering\\nDetailed BO results for the nanoparticle scattering problem are shown in Table 3.\\nAll the BNNs used for the nanoparticle scattering problem use an architecture consisting of 8 hidden layers with 256 units each,\\nwith the exception of BOHAMIANN where we used the original architecture consisting of 2 hidden layers with 50 units each. The\\ninfinite-width neural networks for the nanoparticle task consist of 8 hidden layers of infinite width, each of which are followed by\\nReLU activation functions.\\n11[width=0.45]figures/narrowbandbnn.png[width = 0.45]figures/highpass bnn.png[width =\\n0.45]figures/narrowband other.png[width = 0.45]figures/highpass other.png\\nFigure 4: Additional optimization result curves for the nanoparticle scattering task. (Top) Various BNNs. Note that results using\\nauxiliary information are denoted by a solid line, while those that do not are denoted by a dashed line. Also note that the y-axis is\\nzoomed in to differentiate the curves. (Bottom) Various non-BO algorithms. Ensemble-aux is replicated here for ease of comparison.\\nWe also experiment with KL annealing in BBB, a proposed method to improve the performance of variational methods for BNNs in\\nwhich the weight of the KL term in the loss function is slowly increased throughout training. For these experiments, we exponentially\\nanneal the KL term with weight ˘03c3KL(i) = 10i/500˘22125 as a function of epoch i when training from scratch; during the continued\\ntraining, the weight is held constant at ˘03c3KL = 10˘22123.\\nKL annealing in the BBB architecture significantly improves performance for the narrowband objective, although results are mixed\\nfor the highpass objective. Additionally, KL annealing has the downside of introducing more parameters that must be carefully tuned\\nfor optimal performance. MNF performs poorly, especially on the highpass objective where it is comparable to random sampling,\\nand we have found that MNF is quite sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters for uncertainty estimates even on simple regression\\nproblems.\\nThe different variants infinite-width neural networks do not perform as well as the BNNs on both objective functions, despite the\\nhyperparameter search.\\nLIPO seems to perform as well as GPs on both objective functions, which is impressive given the computational speed of the LIPO\\nalgorithm. Interestingly DIRECT-L does not perform as well as LIPO or GPs on the narrowband objective, and actually performs\\ncomparably to random sampling on the highpass objective. Additionally, CMA performs poorly on both objectives, likely due to the\\nhighly multimodal nature of the objective function landscape.\\nWe also look at the effect of model size in terms of number of layers and units in Figure 10 for ensembles. While including auxiliary\\ninformation clearly improves performance across all architectures, there is not a clear trend of performance with respect to the model\\nsize. Thus, the performance of BO seems to be somewhat robust to the exact architecture as long as the model is large enough to\\naccurately and efficiently train on the data.\\n[width=0.5]figures/modelsize.png\\nFigure 5: Comparison of ybest at N = 1000 for the nanoparticle narrowband objective function for a variety of neural network sizes.\\nAll results are ensembles, and ˘201caux˘201d denotes using auxiliary information.\\nExamples of the optimized structures by the ˘201cEnsemble-aux˘201d architecture are shown in Figure 11.

The size of the ˘201cFC˘201d architectures are\\nchosen to have a similar number of parameters as their convolutional counterparts. Unless otherwise stated, all results in the main\\ntext and here use the ˘201cConv-TI˘201d and ˘201cFC˘201d architectures for BCNNs and BNNs, respectively.\\nThe infinite-width convolutional neural networks (which act as convolutional kernels for GPs) in the PC task consist of 5 convolutional\\nlayers followed by 4 fully-connected layers of infinite width. Because the pooling layers in the Neural Tangents library are currently\\ntoo slow for use in application, we increased the size of the filters to 5 ˘00d7 5 to increase the receptive field of each filter.\\nDetailed BO results for the PC problem are shown in Table 5. For algorithms that optimize over the level set parameterization R51,\\nwe see that GPs perform consistently well, although BNNs using auxiliary information (e.g. Ensemble-Aux) can outperform GPs.\\nDIRECT-L and CMA perform extremely well on the PC-A distribution but performs worse than GP on the PC-B distribution.\\nAdding convolutional layers and auxiliary information improves performance such that BCNNs significantly outperform GPs.\\nInterestingly, the infinite-width networks perform extremely poorly, although this may be due to a lack of pooling layers in their\\narchitecture which limits the receptive field of the convolutions.\\nExamples of the optimized structures by the ˘201cEnsemble-aux˘201d architecture are shown in Figure 12.

All results were optimized by the ˘201cEnsemble-aux˘201d\\narchitecture.\\nTo explore more deeply why certain surrogate models perform well while others do not, we track various metrics of the model\\nduring BO on a validation dataset with 1000 randomly sampled data points. In particular, we look at the mean squared error (MSE),\\nthe mean absolute error (MAE), the negative log-likelihood (NLL), and the calibration error on the PC-A data distribution. Results\\nare shown in Figure 13(a).\\nThe calibration error is a quantitative measure of the uncertainty of the model, which is important for the performance of BO as\\nthe acquisition function uses the uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation. Intuitively, we expect that a 50% confidence\\ninterval contains the correct answer 50\\ncal(F1, y1, ..., FT , yT ) = 1\\nm\\nmX\\nj=1\\n(pj − ˆpj)2 (15)\\nwhere Fj is the CDF of the predictive distribution, pj is the confidence level, and ˘02c6pj is the empirical frequency. We choose to\\nmeasure the error along the confidence levels pj = (j ˘2212 1)/10 for j = 1, 2, ..., 11. The CDF Fj(yj) an be analytically calculated for\\nmodels that have an analytical predictive distribution. For models that do not have an analytical predictive distribution, we use the\\nempirical CDF:\\nF(y) = 1\\nn\\nnX\\ni=1\\n⊮µ(i)≤y (16)\\nwhere 1 is the indicator function. We also plot the calibration, (pj, ˘02c6pj)M j=1, in Figure 13(b).

(b)\\nUncertainty calibration curves measured at various points during BO. Note that the calibration curve for GP-aux is only shown for N\\n= 50, as it becomes computationally intractable for larger N.\\nFigure 13 shows that the infinite neural network kernel (NTK) has the highest prediction error, which is likely a contributing factor\\nto its poor BO performance. Interestingly, vanilla GPs have the lowest MSE, so the prediction error is not the only indicator for\\nBO performance. Looking at the calibration, the infinite neural network kernel has the highest calibration error, and we see from\\nFigure 13(b) that it tends to be overconfident in its predictions. GPs have a higher calibration error than the ensemble neural network\\nmethods and tend to be significantly underconfident in their predictions. GP-aux has higher validation loss, calibration error, and\\nNLL than most, if not all, of the other methods, which explain its poor performance.\\nThe ensemble NN methods tend to be reasonably well-calibrated. Within the ensemble NNs, the \"-aux\" methods have lower MSE\\nand calibration error than their respective counterparts, and ConvEnsemble-aux has the lowest NLL calibration error out of all the\\nmethods, although interestingly Ensemble-aux seems to have the lowest MSE and MAE out of the ensemble NNs.\\nThese results together show that calibration of Bayesian models is extremely important for use as surrogate models in BO.\\n138.8.4 Organic Molecule Quantum Chemistry\\nThe Bayesian graph neural networks (BGNNs) used for the chemical property optimization task consist of 4 edge-conditioned graph\\nconvolutional layers with 32 channels each, followed by a global average pooling operation, followed by 4 fully-connected hidden\\nlayers of 64 units each.

The tendency of variational methods such as BBB to underestimate uncertainty is likely detrimental to their\\nperformance in BO. Additionally, prior work shows that BBB has trouble scaling to larger network sizes, which may make them\\nunsuitable for more complex tasks such as those in our work. BOHAMIANN performs very well on the nanoparticle narrowband\\nobjective and comparable to other BNNs without auxiliary information on the nanoparticle highpass objective. This is likely due to\\nits effectiveness in exploring a multi-modal posterior. However, the need for SGHMC to sample the posterior makes this method\\ncomputationally expensive, and so we were only able to run it for a limited number of iterations using a small neural network\\narchitecture.\\nInfinitely wide neural networks are another interesting research direction, as the ability to derive infinitely wide versions of various\\nneural network architectures such as convolutions, and more recently graph convolutional layers, could potentially bring the power\\nof GPs and BO to complex problems in low-data regimes. However, we find they perform relatively poorly in BO, are quite sensitive\\nto hyperparameters (e.g. kernel and parameterization), and current implementations of certain operations such as pooling are too\\nslow for practical use in an iterative setting. In particular, BO using an infinite ensemble of infinite-width networks performs poorly\\ncompared to normal ensembles, suggesting that the infinite-width formulations do not fully capture the dynamics of their finite-width\\ncounterparts.\\nNon-Bayesian global optimization methods such as LIPO and DIRECT-L are quite powerful in spite of their small computational\\noverhead and can even outperform BO on some simpler tasks. However, they are not as consistent as BO, performing more\\ncomparably to random sampling on other tasks. CMA-ES performs poorly on all the tasks here. Also, like GPs, these non-Bayesian\\nalgorithms assume a continuous input space and cannot be effectively applied to structured, high-dimensional problems.\\n8.10 Compute\\nAll experiments were carried out on systems with NVIDIA V olta V100 GPUs and Intel Xeon Gold 6248 CPUs.

       "  'file_content': 'emoji2vec: Learning Emoji Representations from their\\nDescription\\nAbstract\\nMany current natural language processing applications for social media rely on\\nrepresentation learning and utilize pre-trained word embeddings. There currently\\nexist several publicly-available, pre-trained sets of word embeddings, but they\\ncontain few or no emoji representations even as emoji usage in social media has\\nincreased. emoji2vec are pre-trained embeddings for all Unicode emojis which are\\nlearned from their description in the Unicode emoji standard. The resulting emoji\\nembeddings can be readily used in downstream social natural language processing\\napplications alongside word2vec. For the downstream task of sentiment analysis,\\nemoji embeddings learned from short descriptions outperforms a skip-gram model\\ntrained on a large collection of tweets, while avoiding the need for contexts in\\nwhich emojis need to appear frequently in order to estimate a representation.\\n1 Introduction\\nFirst introduced in 1997, emojis, a standardized set of small pictorial glyphs depicting everything\\nfrom smiling faces to international flags, have seen a drastic increase in usage in social media over\\nthe last decade. The Oxford Dictionary named 2015 the year of the emoji, citing an increase in usage\\nof over 800% during the course of the year, and elected the ’Face with Tears of Joy’ emoji () as the\\nWord of the Year. As of this writing, over 10% of Twitter posts and over 50% of text on Instagram\\ncontain one or more emojis. Due to their popularity and broad usage, they have been the subject\\nof much formal and informal research in language and social communication, as well as in natural\\nlanguage processing (NLP).\\nIn the context of social sciences, research has focused on emoji usage as a means of expressing\\nemotions on mobile platforms. Interestingly, although essentially thought of as means of expressing\\nemotions, emojis have been adopted as tools to express relationally useful roles in conversation.\\nEmojis are culturally and contextually bound, and are open to reinterpretation and misinterpretation.\\nThese findings have paved the way for many formal analyses of semantic characteristics of emojis.\\nConcurrently we observe an increased interest in natural language processing on social media\\ndata. Many current NLP systems applied to social media rely on representation learning and word\\nembeddings. Such systems often rely on pre-trained word embeddings that can for instance be\\nobtained from word2vec or GloVe. Yet, neither resource contain a complete set of Unicode emoji\\nrepresentations, which suggests that many social NLP applications could be improved by the addition\\nof robust emoji representations.\\nEmbeddings for emoji Unicode symbols are learned from their description in the Unicode emoji\\nstandard. The usefulness of emoji representations trained in this way is demonstrated by evaluating on\\na Twitter sentiment analysis task. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis by investigating emoji analogy\\nexamples and visualizing the emoji embedding space is provided.2 Related Work\\nThere has been little work in distributional embeddings of emojis. The first research done in\\nthis direction was an informal blog post by the Instagram Data Team in 2015. They generated\\nvector embeddings for emojis similar to skip-gram-based vectors by training on the entire corpus\\nof Instagram posts. Their research gave valuable insight into the usage of emojis on Instagram,\\nand showed that distributed representations can help understanding emoji semantics in everyday\\nusage. The second contribution, closest to ours, trained emoji embeddings from a large Twitter\\ndataset of over 100 million English tweets using the skip-gram method. These pre-trained emoji\\nrepresentations led to increased accuracy on a similarity task, and a meaningful clustering of the\\nemoji embedding space. While this method is able to learn robust representations for frequently-used\\nemojis, representations of less frequent emojis are estimated rather poorly or not available at all. In\\nfact, only around 700 emojis can be found in this corpus, while there is support of over 1600 emojis\\nin the Unicode standard.\\nThe approach differs in two important aspects. First, since the representation of emojis are estimated\\ndirectly from their description, robust representations are obtained for all supported emoji symbols —\\neven the long tail of infrequently used ones. Secondly, the method works with much less data. Instead\\nof training on millions of tweets, the representations are trained on only a few thousand descriptions.\\nStill, higher accuracy results are obtained on a Twitter sentiment analysis task.\\nIn addition, the work relates to building word representations for words and concepts based on their\\ndescription in a dictionary. Similarly to their approach, representations are build for emojis based on\\ntheir descriptions and keyword phrases.\\nSome of the limitations are evident in the work who showed that different cultural phenomena and\\nlanguages may co-opt conventional emoji sentiment. Since training is only on English-language\\ndefinitions and ignore temporal definitions of emojis, the training method might not capture the full\\nsemantic characteristics of an emoji.\\n3 Methodology\\nThe method maps emoji symbols into the same space as the 300-dimensional Google News word2vec\\nembeddings. Thus, the resulting emoji2vec embeddings can be used in addition to 300-dimensional\\nword2vec embeddings in any application. To this end emojis, their name and their keyword phrases\\nare crawled from the Unicode emoji list, resulting in 6088 descriptions of 1661 emoji symbols.\\n3.1 Model\\nEmoji embeddings are trained using a simple method. For every training example consisting of an\\nemoji and a sequence of words w1, ..., wN describing that emoji, we take the sum of the individual\\nword vectors in the descriptive phrase as found in the Google News word2vec embeddings\\nv =\\nNX\\nk=1\\nwk, (1)\\nwhere wk is the word2vec vector for word wk if that vector exists (otherwise we drop the summand)\\nand vj is the vector representation of the description. A trainable vector xi for every emoji in\\nour training set is defined, and the probability of a match between the emoji representation xi\\nand its description representation vj is modeled using the sigmoid of the dot product of the two\\nrepresentations σ(xT\\ni vj). For training we use the logistic loss\\nL(i, j, yij) =−log(σ(yijxT\\ni vj − (1 − yij)xT\\ni vj)) (2)\\nwhere yij is 1 if description j is valid for emoji i and 0 otherwise.\\n3.2 Optimization\\nThe model is implemented in TensorFlow and optimized using stochastic gradient descent with Adam\\nas optimizer. As we do not observe any negative training examples (invalid descriptions of emojis do\\n2not appear in the original training set), to increase generalization performance we randomly sample\\ndescriptions for emojis as negative instances (i.e. induce a mismatched description). One of the\\nparameters of our model is the ratio of negative samples to positive samples; we found that having\\none positive example per negative example produced the best results. We perform early-stopping on\\na held-out development set and found 80 epochs of training to give the best results. As we are only\\ntraining on emoji descriptions and our method is simple and cheap, training takes less than 3 minutes\\non a 2013 MacBook Pro.\\n4 Experiments\\nThe approach is quantitatively evaluated on an intrinsic (emoji-description classification) and extrinsic\\n(Twitter sentiment analysis) task. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis is given by visualizing the\\nlearned emoji embedding space and investigating emoji analogy examples.\\n4.1 Emoji-Description Classification\\nTo analyze how well the method models the distribution of correct emoji descriptions, a manually-\\nlabeled test set containing pairs of emojis and phrases, as well as a correspondence label was created.\\nFor instance, the test set includes the example: , \"crying\", True, as well as the example , \"fish\", False.\\nσ(xT\\ni vi) is calculated for each example in the test set, measuring the similarity between the emoji\\nvector and the sum of word vectors in the phrase.\\nWhen a classifier thresholds the above prediction at 0.5 to determine a positive or negative correlation,\\nan accuracy of 85.5% is obtained for classifying whether an emoji-description pair is valid or not.\\nBy varying the threshold used for this classifier, a receiver operating characteristic curve with an\\narea-under-the-curve of 0.933 is obtained, which demonstrates that high quality of the learned emoji\\nrepresentations.\\n4.2 Sentiment Analysis on Tweets\\nAs downstream task the accuracy of sentiment classification of tweets for various classifiers with three\\ndifferent sets of pre-trained word embeddings are compared: (1) the original Google News word2vec\\nembeddings, (2) word2vec augmented with emoji embeddings trained by skip-gram model, and (3)\\nword2vec augmented with emoji2vec trained from Unicode descriptions. A dataset is used which\\nconsists of over 67k English tweets labelled manually for positive, neutral, or negative sentiment.\\nIn both the training set and the test set, 46% of tweets are labeled neutral, 29% are labeled positive,\\nand 25% are labeled negative. To compute the feature vectors for training, we summed the vectors\\ncorresponding to each word or emoji in the text of the Tweet. The goal of this simple sentiment\\nanalysis model is not to produce state-of-the-art results in sentiment analysis; it is simply to show that\\nincluding emojis adds discriminating information to a model, which could potentially be exploited in\\nmore advanced social NLP systems.\\nBecause the labels are rather evenly distributed, accuracy is an effective metric in determining\\nperformance on this classification task. Results are reported in Table 1. Augmenting word2vec\\nwith emoji embeddings improves overall classification accuracy on the full corpus, and substantially\\nimproves classification performance for tweets that contain emojis. It suggests that emoji embeddings\\ncould improve performance for other social NLP tasks as well. Furthermore, emoji2vec generally\\noutperforms the emoji embeddings trained by the skip-gram model, despite being trained on much\\nless data using a simple model.\\n4.3 Analogy Task\\nA well-known property of word2vec is that embeddings trained with this method to some extent\\ncapture meaningful linear relationships between words directly in the vector space. For instance, it\\nholds that the vector representation of ’king’ minus ’man’ plus ’woman’ is closest to ’queen’. Word\\nembeddings have commonly been evaluated on such word analogy tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult\\nto build such an analogy task for emojis due to the small number and semantically distinct categories\\nof emojis. Nevertheless, a few intuitive examples were collected. For every query the closest five\\n3Table 1: Three-way classification accuracy on the Twitter sentiment analysis corpus using Random\\nForrests and Linear SVM classifier with different word embeddings.\\nClassification accuracy on entire dataset, N = 12920\\nWord Embeddings Random Forest Linear SVM\\nGoogle News 57.5 58.5\\nGoogle News + (skip-gram model) 58.2* 60.0*\\nGoogle News + emoji2vec 59.5* 60.5*\\nClassification accuracy on tweets containing emoji, N = 2295\\nWord Embeddings Random Forest Linear SVM\\nGoogle News 46.0 47.1\\nGoogle News + (skip-gram model) 52.4* 57.4*\\nGoogle News + emoji2vec 54.4* 59.2*\\nClassification accuracy on 90% most frequent emoji, N = 2186\\nWord Embeddings Random Forest Linear SVM\\nGoogle News 47.3 45.1\\nGoogle News + (skip-gram model) 52.8* 56.9*\\nGoogle News + emoji2vec 55.0* 59.5*\\nClassification accuracy on 10% least frequent emoji, N = 308\\nWord Embeddings Random Forest Linear SVM\\nGoogle News 44.7 43.2\\nGoogle News + (skip-gram model) 53.9* 52.9*\\nGoogle News + emoji2vec 54.5* 55.2*\\nemojis were retrieved.

The resulting\\nemoji embeddings can be used to augment any downstream task that currently uses word2vec\\nembeddings, and might prove especially useful in social NLP tasks where emojis are used frequently\\n(e.g. Twitter, Instagram, etc.). Despite the fact that the model is simpler and trained on much less\\ndata, it outperforms the skip-gram model on the task of Twitter sentiment analysis.\\nAs the approach directly works on Unicode descriptions, it is not restricted to emoji symbols. In\\nthe future the usefulness of the method for other Unicode symbol embeddings will be investigated.\\nFurthermore, plans are made to improve emoji2vec in the future by also reading full text emoji\\ndescriptions and using a recurrent neural network instead of a bag-of-word-vectors approach for\\nenocoding descriptions. In addition, since the approach does not capture the context-dependent\\ndefinitions of emojis (such as sarcasm, or appropriation via other cultural phenomena), mechanisms\\nwill be explored to efficiently capturing these nuanced meanings.\\n46 Data Release and Reproducibility\\nPre-trained emoji2vec embeddings as well as the training data and code are released at https:\\n//github.com/uclmr/emoji2vec.

This approach aims to enhance detection performance, reduce transmission costs, and handle\\ntemporal misalignment effectively. The core innovation lies in leveraging the inherent temporal\\ncoherence present in consecutive frames of a video stream. Instead of transmitting the entirety of\\nfeature maps for each frame, FFNet computes a compact representation of the changes between\\nconsecutive frames, termed \"feature flow.\" This representation efficiently captures the motion and\\nevolution of objects within the scene. By focusing on these dynamic aspects, FFNet significantly\\nreduces the data transmission volume, thereby mitigating bandwidth limitations. The efficiency\\ngains are particularly crucial in resource-constrained environments typical of vehicle-to-infrastructure\\ncommunication. Furthermore, the robustness to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing for\\nreliable operation even with delays and jitter inherent in real-world communication channels.\\nThe design of FFNet incorporates several key modules. Firstly, a feature extraction module processes\\ninput frames to generate high-dimensional feature maps. These maps are then fed into a flow\\nestimation module, which computes the optical flow between consecutive frames. This optical flow\\nfield is subsequently used to warp features from the preceding frame, aligning them with the current\\nframe’s features. The difference between these warped features and the current frame’s features\\nconstitutes the feature flow. This difference is then compressed using a learned compression scheme,\\ncarefully designed to minimize information loss while maximizing the compression ratio. The\\nselection of an appropriate compression algorithm is critical to balancing the trade-off between data\\nreduction and preservation of essential information for accurate object detection.\\nThe compressed feature flow is transmitted to a central processing unit (CPU), where it’s used to\\nupdate the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map then serves as input\\nfor the object detection process. The utilization of feature flow enables efficient updates, even\\nin the presence of temporal misalignment between frames received from disparate sources. This\\nresilience to asynchrony is a significant advantage over methods requiring strict synchronization. The\\nproposed method is rigorously evaluated on a large-scale VIC3D dataset, demonstrating substantial\\n.improvements in detection accuracy and communication efficiency compared to baseline methods\\nthat transmit raw data or full feature maps ??.\\nFurther validation of FFNet’s robustness to temporal asynchrony is provided through extensive exper-\\niments involving varying levels of delay and jitter in the simulated communication channel. Results\\nconsistently show that FFNet maintains high detection accuracy even under significant temporal\\nmisalignment, surpassing existing methods reliant on strict synchronization ?. This robustness stems\\nfrom the ability of feature flow to capture the essential scene changes, irrespective of minor temporal\\ndiscrepancies. A detailed analysis of the compression scheme’s efficiency reveals a substantial\\nreduction in bandwidth consumption compared to transmitting raw data or full feature maps.\\nFinally, the influence of different compression parameters on detection performance and communica-\\ntion efficiency is thoroughly investigated. The findings offer insights into the optimal balance between\\ncompression ratio and detection accuracy, enabling adaptive adjustment of compression parameters\\nbased on available bandwidth and desired detection performance. The FFNet framework presents a\\npromising solution for efficient and robust VIC3D object detection in challenging communication\\nenvironments. Future work will explore extensions to handle more complex scenarios, such as\\nocclusions and varying weather conditions ?.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe problem of efficient data transmission in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication for 3D\\nobject detection has received considerable attention. Early approaches focused on transmitting raw\\nsensor data, such as point clouds or images, directly to a central processing unit for processing ?.\\nHowever, this approach suffers from high bandwidth requirements and is susceptible to delays and\\npacket loss, particularly in challenging communication environments. Subsequent work explored the\\nuse of compressed sensing techniques to reduce the amount of data transmitted ?, but these methods\\noften introduce significant information loss, leading to a degradation in detection performance.\\nFurthermore, the synchronization requirements of these methods can be stringent, making them less\\nrobust to temporal asynchrony.\\nMore recent research has investigated the use of feature maps instead of raw data for transmission.\\nThese methods typically involve extracting features from sensor data at the edge and transmitting\\nthese features to a central server for object detection. While this approach reduces the amount of data\\ntransmitted compared to transmitting raw data, it still requires significant bandwidth, especially for\\nhigh-resolution sensor data. Moreover, the sensitivity to temporal misalignment remains a challenge.\\nSeveral works have explored techniques for improving the robustness of feature-based methods to\\ntemporal asynchrony, such as using temporal smoothing filters or predictive models ?. However,\\nthese methods often introduce computational overhead and may not be effective in scenarios with\\nsignificant delays or jitter.\\nOur work differs from previous approaches by focusing on transmitting only the changes in features\\nbetween consecutive frames, rather than the entire feature maps. This approach, based on the\\nconcept of feature flow, significantly reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted while\\nmaintaining high detection accuracy. Existing methods that utilize optical flow for object tracking\\nor video compression typically operate on pixel-level data or low-level features. In contrast, FFNet\\noperates on high-level features extracted from a deep convolutional neural network, allowing for\\na more robust and efficient representation of the scene dynamics. This allows for a more compact\\nrepresentation of the scene changes, leading to significant bandwidth savings.\\nThe use of learned compression schemes further distinguishes our approach. Unlike traditional com-\\npression methods that rely on generic compression algorithms, FFNet employs a learned compression\\nscheme specifically tailored to the characteristics of feature flow. This allows for a better balance\\nbetween compression ratio and information preservation, leading to improved detection performance.\\nFurthermore, the adaptive nature of the compression scheme allows for dynamic adjustment of the\\ncompression parameters based on the available bandwidth and desired detection performance. This\\nadaptability is crucial in dynamic communication environments where bandwidth availability can\\nfluctuate significantly.\\nFinally, the robustness of FFNet to temporal asynchrony is a key advantage over existing methods.\\nWhile some previous works have addressed temporal asynchrony in V2I communication, they of-\\n2ten rely on complex synchronization mechanisms or introduce significant computational overhead.\\nFFNet’s ability to handle temporal misalignment effectively without requiring strict synchroniza-\\ntion makes it particularly well-suited for real-world V2I applications where delays and jitter are\\nunavoidable. The proposed method offers a significant improvement in both efficiency and robustness\\ncompared to existing approaches.\\n3 Methodology\\nThe proposed Feature Flow Net (FFNet) framework addresses the challenges of temporal asynchrony\\nand limited bandwidth in vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D (VIC3D) object detection by trans-\\nmitting compressed feature flow instead of raw data or full feature maps. This approach leverages the\\ntemporal coherence inherent in video streams, focusing on the dynamic changes between consecutive\\nframes rather than transmitting redundant information. The core of FFNet consists of three main\\nmodules: feature extraction, flow estimation, and compression.\\nThe feature extraction module employs a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), such as\\nResNet or EfficientNet, to process input frames and generate high-dimensional feature maps. These\\nfeature maps capture rich semantic information about the scene, providing a robust representation\\nfor subsequent processing. The choice of CNN architecture is crucial for balancing computational\\ncomplexity and feature representation quality. We experimented with several architectures and\\nselected the one that provided the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency. The\\noutput of this module is a sequence of feature maps, one for each frame in the video stream.\\nThe flow estimation module computes the optical flow between consecutive feature maps. This is\\nachieved using a deep learning-based optical flow estimation network, such as FlowNet or PWC-Net.\\nThe optical flow field represents the motion of features between frames, providing a measure of how\\nfeatures move and change over time. This optical flow is then used to warp the features from the\\nprevious frame to align them with the current frame. This warping step is crucial for accurately\\nrepresenting the changes in features, as it accounts for the motion of objects in the scene. The\\naccuracy of the optical flow estimation is critical for the overall performance of FFNet.\\nThe difference between the warped features from the previous frame and the current frame’s features\\nconstitutes the feature flow. This feature flow represents the dynamic changes in the scene, capturing\\nthe motion and evolution of objects. The feature flow is then compressed using a learned compression\\nscheme, which is trained to minimize information loss while maximizing compression ratio. This\\ncompression scheme is crucial for reducing the amount of data that needs to be transmitted. We\\nexplored various compression techniques, including autoencoders and learned quantization methods,\\nand selected the one that provided the best balance between compression ratio and reconstruction\\naccuracy. The compressed feature flow is then transmitted to the central processing unit.\\nAt the central processing unit, the received compressed feature flow is decompressed and used to\\nupdate the feature maps from the previous frame. This updated feature map is then used for object\\ndetection using a suitable object detection network. The use of feature flow allows for efficient\\nupdates, even in the presence of temporal misalignment between frames. The robustness of FFNet\\nto temporal asynchrony is a key advantage, allowing for reliable operation even with delays and\\njitter inherent in real-world communication channels. The entire process, from feature extraction to\\nobject detection, is optimized for efficiency and robustness, making FFNet a suitable solution for\\nresource-constrained environments. The performance of FFNet is evaluated on a large-scale VIC3D\\ndataset, demonstrating significant improvements in detection accuracy and communication efficiency\\ncompared to baseline methods ????.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo evaluate the performance of FFNet, we conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale VIC3D\\ndataset. This dataset consists of synchronized video streams from multiple cameras deployed along\\na highway, along with corresponding 3D bounding box annotations for various objects, including\\nvehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets,\\nwith a ratio of 70:15:15. We used standard metrics for evaluating object detection performance,\\nincluding precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP). The experiments were\\ndesigned to assess the impact of different factors on FFNet’s performance, including the choice of\\n3CNN architecture for feature extraction, the optical flow estimation method, the compression scheme,\\nand the level of temporal asynchrony.\\nOur baseline methods included transmitting raw sensor data (point clouds), transmitting full feature\\nmaps extracted from a pre-trained CNN, and a state-of-the-art method for compressed sensing-based\\ndata transmission. We compared FFNet’s performance against these baselines in terms of detection\\naccuracy, communication bandwidth consumption, and robustness to temporal asynchrony. The\\nexperiments were conducted on a high-performance computing cluster with multiple GPUs. We\\nused a variety of hyperparameters for each component of FFNet, including the learning rate, batch\\nsize, and network architecture, and selected the optimal hyperparameters based on the validation\\nset performance. The training process involved minimizing a loss function that combined the\\nreconstruction loss of the compression scheme and the object detection loss.\\nThe results demonstrated that FFNet significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both\\ndetection accuracy and communication efficiency. FFNet achieved a mAP of 88.5\\nTo evaluate the robustness of FFNet to temporal asynchrony, we introduced varying levels of delay\\nand jitter into the simulated communication channel. The results showed that FFNet maintained\\nhigh detection accuracy even under significant temporal misalignment, outperforming the baseline\\nmethods that rely on strict synchronization. Specifically, FFNet’s mAP remained above 85\\nFinally, we investigated the impact of different compression parameters on the detection performance\\nand communication efficiency. We varied the compression ratio and analyzed its effect on the mAP\\nand bandwidth consumption. The results showed a trade-off between compression ratio and detection\\naccuracy, with higher compression ratios leading to lower detection accuracy but also lower bandwidth\\nconsumption. We identified an optimal compression ratio that balanced these two factors, providing a\\ngood compromise between accuracy and efficiency. This adaptive compression scheme allows FFNet\\nto adjust its parameters based on the available bandwidth and desired detection performance, making\\nit suitable for dynamic communication environments. The detailed results are presented in Table 2.\\nTable 1: Comparison of FFNet with baseline methods\\nMethod mAP Bandwidth (MB/s) Robustness to Asynchrony\\nRaw Data 75.2 100 Low\\nFull Feature Maps 82.1 50 Medium\\nCompressed Sensing 78.9 30 Medium\\nFFNet 88.5 20 High\\n5 Results\\nTo evaluate the performance of FFNet, we conducted extensive experiments on a large-scale VIC3D\\ndataset comprising synchronized video streams from multiple cameras deployed along a highway,\\nalong with corresponding 3D bounding box annotations for various objects. The dataset was split into\\ntraining, validation, and testing sets (70:15:15 ratio). Standard object detection metrics (precision,\\nrecall, F1-score, mAP) were employed. Experiments assessed the impact of various factors: CNN\\narchitecture for feature extraction, optical flow estimation method, compression scheme, and temporal\\nasynchrony levels.\\nOur baseline methods included transmitting raw sensor data (point clouds), transmitting full feature\\nmaps from a pre-trained CNN, and a state-of-the-art compressed sensing-based method. We compared\\nFFNet against these baselines in terms of detection accuracy, bandwidth consumption, and robustness\\nto temporal asynchrony. Experiments were performed on a high-performance computing cluster\\nwith multiple GPUs. Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, network architecture) was\\nperformed using the validation set. The training process minimized a loss function combining the\\ncompression scheme’s reconstruction loss and the object detection loss.\\nThe results demonstrated that FFNet significantly outperforms the baseline methods in terms of both\\ndetection accuracy and communication efficiency. FFNet achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP)\\nof 88.5%, surpassing the raw data transmission baseline (75.2%), the full feature map transmission\\nbaseline (82.1%), and the compressed sensing baseline (78.9%). Furthermore, FFNet reduced\\n4bandwidth consumption by a factor of 5 compared to the raw data baseline and by a factor of 2\\ncompared to the full feature map baseline. These results highlight FFNet’s effectiveness in reducing\\ndata transmission while maintaining high detection accuracy. Detailed results are presented in Table\\n2.\\nTo assess FFNet’s robustness to temporal asynchrony, we introduced varying levels of delay and\\njitter into a simulated communication channel. FFNet maintained high detection accuracy even under\\nsignificant temporal misalignment, outperforming synchronization-dependent baseline methods.\\nSpecifically, FFNet’s mAP remained above 85% even with a delay of up to 200ms and jitter of up\\nto 50ms. This robustness is attributed to feature flow’s ability to capture essential scene changes\\nregardless of minor temporal discrepancies. Baseline methods, however, showed a significant\\nperformance drop with increasing asynchrony.\\nFinally, we investigated the impact of different compression parameters on detection performance and\\ncommunication efficiency.

       "  'file_content': 'Enhanced Normalization in Vision Transformers: The Dual PatchNorm\\nApproach\\nAbstract\\nThis study introduces Dual PatchNorm, a modification for Vision Transformers that incorporates two Layer\\nNormalization layers (LayerNorms) positioned before and after the patch embedding layer. The effectiveness of\\nDual PatchNorm is demonstrated through its superior performance compared to alternative LayerNorm placement\\nstrategies within the Transformer block, as determined through extensive testing. Experimental results across\\nvarious tasks, including image classification, contrastive learning, semantic segmentation, and transfer learning on\\ndownstream classification datasets, consistently show that this simple adjustment leads to improved accuracy over\\nwell-optimized standard Vision Transformers, without any negative impact.\\n1 Introduction\\nLayer Normalization is essential for the successful and stable training of Transformer models, enabling high performance across\\ndiverse tasks. This normalization technique is equally vital in Vision Transformers (ViTs), which largely adhere to the standard\\narchitecture of the original Transformer model.\\nThis research investigates whether a different arrangement of LayerNorms can enhance ViT models. Initially, we evaluate five\\nViT architectures on ImageNet-1k and find that an exhaustive search for optimal LayerNorm placements within the Transformer\\nblock’s components does not yield improvements in classification accuracy. This suggests that the pre-LN approach in ViTs is nearly\\noptimal. Further investigation reveals that alternative LayerNorm placements, such as NormFormer and Sub-LN, also do not surpass\\nthe performance of robust ViT classification models when used independently.\\nA significant finding of this study is the observation that the addition of LayerNorms before and after the standard ViT-projection\\nlayer, termed Dual PatchNorm (DPN), can substantially improve performance over well-tuned baseline ViTs. Experiments conducted\\non image classification across three datasets with varying sample sizes, as well as contrastive learning, confirm the effectiveness\\nof DPN. Notably, qualitative analysis indicates that the LayerNorm scale parameters assign greater weight to pixels located at the\\ncenter and corners of each patch.\\n2 Related Work\\nPrior research has explored modifications to the patch-embedding layer in ViTs. For instance, one study demonstrated that adding a\\nLayerNorm after patch-embedding enhances ViT’s resilience to image corruptions on smaller datasets. Another study replaced the\\nstandard Transformer stem with a series of stacked stride-two 3x3 convolutions with batch normalizations, resulting in improved\\nsensitivity to optimization hyperparameters and increased final accuracy.\\nFurther analysis of LayerNorm has shown that the derivatives of the mean and variance significantly contribute to performance, as\\nopposed to forward normalization. Alternative strategies like Image-LN and Patch-LN have been considered for efficiently training\\na single model across different patch sizes. Some researchers have added extra LayerNorms before the final dense projection in\\nthe self-attention block and the non-linearity in the MLP block, employing a different initialization strategy. Others have proposed\\nadding LayerNorms after the final dense projection in the self-attention block, along with a LayerNorm after the non-linearity in the\\nMLP block.\\nIn contrast to previous studies, our work demonstrates that applying LayerNorms both before and after the embedding layer\\nconsistently enhances performance in classification and contrastive learning tasks. While other research has focused on incorporating\\nconvolutional inductive biases into Vision Transformers, our study exclusively and thoroughly examines LayerNorm placements\\nwithin the standard ViT architecture.3 Methodology\\n3.1 Patch Embedding Layer in Vision Transformer\\nVision Transformers consist of a patch embedding layer (PE) followed by multiple Transformer blocks. The PE layer first transforms\\nan image x ∈ RH×W×3 into a sequence of patches xp ∈ RP2×P2HW , where P is the patch size. Each patch is then independently\\nprojected using a dense layer, creating a sequence of \"visual tokens\" xt ∈ RHWP 2×D. The patch size P determines the trade-off\\nbetween the granularity of the visual tokens and the computational demands of subsequent Transformer layers.\\n3.2 Layer Normalization\\nWhen applied to a sequence of N patches x ∈ RN×D, LayerNorm in ViTs involves two steps:\\nx = x − µ(x)\\nσ(x) (1)\\ny = γx + β (2)\\nwhere µ(x) ∈ RN , σ(x) ∈ RN , γ ∈ RD, and β ∈ RD.\\nFirst, Equation 3.1 normalizes each patch xi ∈ RD in the sequence to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. Then, Equation\\n3.2 applies learnable shifts and scales β and γ, which are shared across all patches.\\n3.3 Alternate LayerNorm placements:\\nFollowing established practices, ViTs typically place LayerNorms before each self-attention and MLP layer, known as the pre-LN\\nstrategy. We assess three different strategies for each self-attention and MLP layer: placing LayerNorm before (pre-LN), after\\n(post-LN), and both before and after (pre+post-LN). This results in nine distinct combinations.\\n3.4 Dual PatchNorm\\nInstead of adding LayerNorms within the Transformer block, we propose applying them to the stem alone, both before and after the\\npatch embedding layer. Specifically, we replace:\\nx = P E(x) (3)\\nwith\\nx = LN(P E(LN(x))) (4)\\nwhile keeping the rest of the architecture unchanged. We refer to this approach as Dual PatchNorm (DPN).\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Setup\\nWe utilize the standard Vision Transformer formulation, which has demonstrated broad applicability across various vision tasks. We\\ntrain ViT architectures, both with and without DPN, in a supervised manner on three datasets with varying numbers of examples:\\nImageNet-1k (1M), ImageNet-21k (21M), and JFT (4B). In our experiments, we apply DPN directly to the baseline ViT recipes\\nwithout any additional hyperparameter tuning. We divide the ImageNet training set into training and validation subsets and use the\\nvalidation set to finalize the DPN recipe.\\nFor ImageNet-1k, we train five architectures: Ti/16, S/16, S/32, B/16, and B/32 using a standard recipe for 93,000 steps with a batch\\nsize of 4,096. We report the accuracy on the official ImageNet validation split. Additionally, we evaluate an S/16 baseline (S/16+)\\nwith extensive hyperparameter tuning on ImageNet. We also apply DPN to the base and small DeiT variants.\\nOn ImageNet-21k, we use a similar setup as ImageNet-1k and report ImageNet 25-shot accuracies in two training regimes: 93K and\\n930K steps.\\nFor JFT, we evaluate the ImageNet 25-shot accuracies of three variants (B/32, B/16, and L/16) in two training regimes (220K and\\n1.1M steps) with a batch size of 4,096, without additional data augmentation or mixup regularization.\\nWe report the 95% confidence interval across at least three independent runs on ImageNet-1k. Due to the computational cost of\\ntraining on ImageNet-21k and JFT, we train each model once and report the mean 25-shot accuracy with a 95% confidence interval\\nacross three random seeds.\\n24.2 DPN versus alternate LayerNorm placements\\nEach Transformer block in ViT includes a self-attention (SA) and an MLP layer. Following the pre-LN strategy, LN is placed before\\nboth the SA and MLP layers. We first demonstrate that the default pre-LN strategy in ViT models is nearly optimal by evaluating\\nalternative LN placements on ImageNet-1k. We then compare this with the performance of NormFormer, Sub-LN, and DPN.\\nFor each SA and MLP layer, we evaluate three LN placements: Pre, Post, and Pre+Post, resulting in nine total LN placement\\nconfigurations. Additionally, we assess the LayerNorm placements in NormFormer and Sub LayerNorm, which add extra Layer-\\nNorms within the self-attention and MLP layers in the transformer block. Figure 1 shows that none of these placements significantly\\noutperform the default Pre-LN strategy, indicating that the default strategy is close to optimal. NormFormer provides some\\nimprovements on ViT models with a patch size of 32. However, DPN consistently enhances performance across all five architectures.\\nFigure 1: This plot illustrates the accuracy gains achieved by various LayerNorm placement strategies over the default pre-LN\\nstrategy. Each blue point represents a different LN placement within the Transformer block. None of the alternative placements\\nsurpass the default Pre-LN strategy on ImageNet-1k. The application of DPN (represented by the black cross) consistently improves\\nperformance across all five architectures.\\n4.3 Comparison to ViT\\nTable 1 (left) shows that DPN improved the accuracy of B/16, the best ViT model, by 0.7, while S/32 achieved the maximum\\naccuracy gain of 1.9. The average gain across all architectures is 1.4. On top of DeiT-S and DeiT-B, DPN provides improvements of\\n0.3 and 0.2, respectively. Furthermore, we fine-tune B/16 and B/32 models with and without DPN on high-resolution ImageNet\\n(384x384) for 5,000 steps with a batch size of 512. Applying DPN improves the high-resolution, fine-tuned B/16 and B/32 by 0.6\\nand 1.0, respectively.\\nDPN enhances all architectures trained on ImageNet-21k (Table 1, right) and JFT (Table 2) in shorter training regimes, with average\\ngains of 1.7 and 0.8, respectively. In longer training regimes, DPN improves the accuracy of the best-performing architectures on\\nJFT and ImageNet-21k by 0.5 and 0.4, respectively.\\nIn three cases (Ti/16 and S/32 with ImageNet-21k, and B/16 with JFT), DPN matches or slightly underperforms compared to the\\nbaseline. Nevertheless, across a large proportion of ViT models, simply applying DPN out-of-the-box on top of well-tuned ViT\\nbaselines leads to significant improvements.\\nTable 1: Left: ImageNet-1k validation accuracies of five ViT architectures with and without Dual PatchNorm after 93,000 steps.\\nRight: Training ViT models on ImageNet-21k in two regimes (93k and 930k steps) with a batch size of 4,096, showing ImageNet\\n25-shot accuracies with and without Dual PatchNorm.\\nViT AugReg ImageNet-21k\\nArch Base DPN Arch Base DPN\\nS/32 72.1 ± 0.07 74.0 ± 0.09 93K Steps\\nTi/16 72.5 ± 0.07 73.9 ± 0.09 Ti/16 52.2 ± 0.07 53.6 ± 0.07\\nB/32 74.8 ± 0.06 76.2 ± 0.07 S/32 54.1 ± 0.03 56.7 ± 0.03\\nS/16 78.6 ± 0.32 79.7 ± 0.2 B/32 60.9 ± 0.03 63.7 ± 0.03\\nS/16+ 79.7 ± 0.09 80.2 ± 0.03 S/16 64.3 ± 0.15 65.0 ± 0.06\\nB/16 80.4 ± 0.06 81.1 ± 0.09 B/16 70.8 ± 0.09 72.0 ± 0.03\\nDeiT 930K Steps\\nS/16 80.1 ± 0.03 80.4 ± 0.06 Ti/16 61.0 ± 0.03 61.2 ± 0.03\\nB/16 81.8 ± 0.03 82.0 ± 0.05 S/32 63.8 ± 0.00 65.1 ± 0.12\\nAugReg + 384x384 Finetune B/32 72.8 ± 0.03 73.1 ± 0.07\\nB/32 79.0 ± 0.00 80.0 ± 0.03 S/16 72.5 ± 0.1 72.5 ± 0.1\\nB/16 82.2 ± 0.03 82.8 ± 0.00 B/16 78.0 ± 0.06 78.4 ± 0.03\\n4.4 Finetuning on ImageNet with DPN\\nWe fine-tune four models trained on JFT-4B with two resolutions on ImageNet-1k: (B/32, B/16) × (220K, 1.1M) steps at resolutions\\n224x224 and 384x384.

Natural datasets contain images\\ncaptured with standard cameras, Specialized datasets have images from specialized equipment, and Structured datasets require scene\\ncomprehension. We use the VTAB training protocol, which defines a standard training split of 800 examples and a validation split of\\n200 examples per dataset. We perform a lightweight sweep across three learning rates for each dataset and select the best model\\nbased on the mean validation accuracy across three seeds.

We also ablate the effect of each of these operations in DPN.\\nApplying only learnable scales and shifts without normalization significantly decreases accuracy across all architectures (See: Only\\nlearnable in Table 6). Additionally, removing the learnable parameters leads to unstable training on B/16 (No learnable in Table 6).\\nFinally, removing the centering and bias parameters, as done in RMSNorm, reduces the accuracy of B/32, S/32, and Ti/16. We\\nconclude that while both normalization and learnable parameters contribute to the success of DPN, normalization has a greater\\nimpact.\\n57 Analysis\\n7.1 Gradient Norm Scale\\nWe present per-layer gradient norms for B/16, both with and without DPN. Figure 2 (Left) displays the mean gradient norm of the last\\n1000 training steps as a function of depth. Notably, the gradient norm of the base ViT patch embedding (black) is disproportionately\\nlarge compared to other layers. Applying DPN (red) scales down the gradient norm of the embedding layer. Figure 2 (Right) further\\nshows that the gradient norm of the embedding layer is reduced not only before convergence but also throughout the training process.\\nThis characteristic is consistent across ViT architectures of different sizes.\\n7.2 Visualizing Scale Parameters\\nThe first LayerNorm in Eq. 4 is applied directly to patches, i.e., raw pixels. Thus, the learnable parameters (biases and scales) of\\nthe first LayerNorm can be visualized directly in pixel space. Figure 3 shows the scales of our smallest and largest models: Ti/16\\ntrained on ImageNet for 90,000 steps and L/16 trained on JFT for 1.1M steps, respectively. Since the absolute magnitude of the scale\\nparameters varies across the R, G, and B channels, we visualize the scale separately for each channel. Interestingly, for both models,\\nthe scale parameter increases the weight of the pixels in the center of the patch and at the corners.\\n8 Conclusion\\nWe propose a straightforward modification to standard ViT models\\n6'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems:\\nMaximizing Sample Efficiency and Minimizing Variance\\nAbstract\\nOptimizing long-term user satisfaction in recommender systems, such as news feeds, is crucial during continuous\\nuser-system interactions. Reinforcement learning has shown promise in addressing this challenge. However,\\npractical hurdles like low sample efficiency, potential risks, and high variance hinder the implementation of deep\\nreinforcement learning in online systems. We introduce a new reinforcement learning approach called model-based\\ncounterfactual advantage learning (MBCAL) to tackle these challenges. MBCAL leverages the unique aspects of\\nrecommender systems and incorporates concepts from model-based reinforcement learning to enhance sample\\nefficiency. It consists of two main parts: an environment model that predicts immediate user behavior sequentially\\nand a future advantage model that forecasts future utility. Counterfactual comparisons from the environment model\\nare used to mitigate the excessive variance when training the future advantage model. Consequently, MBCAL\\nachieves high sample efficiency and significantly reduced variance, while utilizing existing user logs to avoid\\nstarting from scratch. Despite its capabilities, MBCAL maintains a relatively low implementation cost, making it\\nsuitable for real-world systems. The proposed method surpasses other supervised learning and RL-based methods\\nin both sample efficiency and overall performance, as demonstrated through theoretical analysis and extensive\\nexperiments.\\n1 Introduction\\nRecommender systems are essential for delivering personalized content and improving the efficiency of information retrieval.\\nModern recommender systems, like news feeds, must consider multiple user-system interactions within a single session. The content\\nrecommended in past interactions can influence future user behavior. For example, exploring new topics might pique a user’s interest\\nin related areas, while repeatedly showing similar content could lead to a rapid decline in user engagement. Traditional recommender\\nsystems rely on collaborative filtering or neural networks to predict immediate user actions, such as clicks. However, solely focusing\\non immediate actions can result in issues like recommendation redundancy, ultimately harming the user’s long-term experience.\\nRecently, deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has gained attention for its potential in recommender systems. Deep RL models\\nuser-system interactions as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Many studies in this field focus on model-free reinforcement\\nlearning (MFRL) methods. However, challenges persist, including the substantial data consumption during training, also known as\\nlow sample efficiency. Another challenge is the practical risks associated with implementing MFRL. On-policy RL struggles to\\nutilize off-policy user logs, leading to difficulties in online infrastructure and initial performance. Conversely, off-policy RL faces\\nthe risk of non-convergence when combined with function approximation and offline training.\\nModel-based RL (MBRL) offers an alternative with improved sample efficiency and reduced practical risks. MBRL employs\\nan environment model to predict immediate feedback and state transitions, along with a planning module to find an optimal\\ntrajectory. However, MBRL can be computationally intensive during inference. Planning is often infeasible in multi-stage retrieval\\nframeworks commonly used in modern recommender systems. These systems generate candidate sets of items in earlier stages for\\nsubsequent stages, making it impossible to predetermine candidates. To address these issues, Dyna algorithms have been proposed\\nfor recommender systems. The Dyna algorithm accelerates convergence by generating virtual interactions using the environment\\nmodel. However, this faster convergence comes at the cost of reduced asymptotic performance due to error accumulation from\\nvirtual interactions.\\nAnother significant challenge in deploying RL is the excessive variance of gradients during optimization. This variance can stem\\nfrom stochastic transitions, noisy rewards, and stochastic policies. Longer horizons tend to exacerbate the variance, significantly\\nslowing down convergence and introducing instability. Prior research has shown that using an advantage function instead of a value\\nfunction can reduce variance and improve performance. However, these proposals primarily target MFRL, and variance reduction in\\nMBRL remains largely unexplored.\\nIn recommender systems, variance can arise from various factors. First, there is substantial noise in observed user feedback. Some\\nusers may be more inclined to provide positive or negative feedback than others. Even individual users may exhibit differentbehaviors at different times of the day. Second, for stochastic policies, resampling trajectories from any state can lead to varying\\nlong-term returns. While a large amount of data can mitigate the impact of variance, it still negatively affects performance due to\\ndata sparsity for specific users and items.\\nTo address variance reduction, our work introduces the concept of comparing an observed trajectory with a counterfactual trajectory.\\nThis counterfactual trajectory shares all contexts with the original, including the user, historical interactions, and follow-up items,\\nexcept for the current action being replaced. By comparing these trajectories, we can make more informed judgments about the\\nadvantage of taking a specific action. While finding such counterfactual records in user logs is impossible, we can leverage the\\nenvironment model to simulate future rollouts and generate these trajectories.\\nBuilding on this idea, we propose a novel MBRL solution for recommender systems called Model-based Counterfactual Advantage\\nLearning (MBCAL). MBCAL decomposes overall utility into immediate utility (rewards from the current step) and future utility\\n(rewards from future steps). The environment model naturally predicts immediate utility, while future utility is approximated through\\nsimulated rollout. To further reduce variance in future utilities, we perform two comparative simulated rollouts. We introduce a\\nmasking item to the environment model, enabling us to generate simulated rollouts by masking the action of interest. We then\\ncalculate the counterfactual future advantage (CFA) as the difference in future utility with and without masking. Finally, we introduce\\nthe future advantage model to approximate the CFA.\\nWe conducted experiments using three real-world datasets and compared our method with supervised learning, MFRL, and MBRL\\napproaches. We also focused on Batch-RL and Growing Batch-RL settings, which are more aligned with practical infrastructures.\\nThe experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.\\n2 Methodology\\nThe core concept of MBCAL is illustrated by employing two models: the Masked Environment Model (MEM) and the Future\\nAdvantage Model (FAM). These models are designed to estimate immediate user behavior and future advantages, respectively. The\\ntraining process begins with optimizing the environment model to predict user behaviors, incorporating a masking item into the\\nmodel. Using the MEM, we compute the Counterfactual Future Advantage (CFA) by contrasting the future utility derived from\\nmasking the action against not masking it. The CFA then serves as the target for training the FAM. During inference, we combine\\nboth models to select actions.\\nWe first formalize the environment model and then detail the MEM, FAM, and the overall learning process. Following this, we\\nprovide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method.\\n2.1 Environment Modeling\\nTypically, an environment model predicts transitions and rewards separately. Here, we use approximations for the transition\\nprobability and the reward function. Specifically, to formulate the environment model in a recommender system context, we can\\nexpress the transition probability as the probability of observing the next user behavior given the past trajectory and the current\\naction. This means that predicting the transition simplifies to predicting the immediate user behavior. Since the reward also depends\\nsolely on user behavior, a single model can replace the separate transition and reward approximations. We introduce a function with\\ntrainable parameters to approximate the probability of the next user behavior. The transition and reward are then approximated using\\nthis function.\\n2.2 Masked Environment Model\\nTo mitigate the intractable noise in user feedback, we introduce a masking item into the model. This allows us to create a\\ncounterfactual comparison to the current trajectory, answering the question: \"What would the future behavior be if this action were\\nnot taken?\" We introduce a virtual item represented by a trainable embedding vector. Given an observation trajectory, we denote the\\ntrajectory where actions at specific positions are replaced by this virtual item as a masked trajectory.\\nTraining is straightforward. We sample random positions for each trajectory, replacing each position with a uniform probability. The\\nMEM aims to recover the user behavior as closely as possible when some items are masked. Using the collected masked trajectories,\\nwe maximize the likelihood or minimize the negative log-likelihood (NLL).\\nTo model sequential observations, the MEM’s architecture follows that of session-based recurrent recommender systems. We use a\\nGated Neural Network to encode the trajectory. Since we need to encode both the trajectory and the current action, we concatenate\\nthe input in a staggered manner. For each step, the model takes the previous behavior and the current action as input and outputs the\\nprobability of the next possible behavior. An additional start symbol is introduced as the beginning of the observed user behavior.\\nThe architecture is formulated as follows: a representation layer, a concatenation operation, a multilayer perceptron, and a Gated\\nRecurrent Unit.\\n22.3 Counterfactual Future Advantage\\nUsing the Masked Environment Model (MEM), we can estimate the difference in future utilities between the original trajectory and\\nits counterfactual counterpart, which we term the Counterfactual Future Advantage (CFA). Given a trained MEM, we first define the\\nSimulated Future Reward (SFR) for an observed trajectory at a specific time step. We then calculate the CFA by subtracting the SFR\\nof the counterfactual comparison from the original one. Finally, we introduce the Future Advantage Model (FAM), with its own set\\nof trainable parameters, to approximate this CFA. To train the FAM, we minimize the mean square error.\\nThe FAM uses a similar neural architecture to the MEM, except for the final layer, but with different parameters. Instead of predicting\\na distribution, the FAM’s last layer predicts a scalar value representing the advantage.\\n2.4 Summary of MBCAL\\nFor inference, we select the item (action) based on both the MEM and FAM. Formally, given user information and the observation\\ntrajectory, we choose the next action by maximizing the sum of the immediate reward predicted by the MEM and the future advantage\\npredicted by the FAM. To avoid local optima in policy improvement, we use anε-greedy strategy. With probability ε, we select a\\nrandom action; otherwise, we select the action that maximizes the combined reward and advantage.\\nMBCAL aligns well with the Growing Batch-RL settings. The algorithm involves iterative data collection and policy updates.\\nAlthough we use the term \"policy,\" we do not require an explicit policy formulation, unlike common policy gradient methods, which\\nare often challenging to define in many recommender systems.\\nThe variance reduction in MBCAL is primarily achieved through the subtraction in the CFA calculation, which eliminates noise\\nfrom user feedback and other sources. While we borrow ideas from the advantage function concept, our CFA differs in that we do\\nnot resample the trajectory but keep the remaining part unchanged. Although this could introduce bias in many MDP problems, we\\nargue that recommender systems exhibit weaker correlations between sequential decisions compared to other domains (e.g., robot or\\ngame control). Additionally, since the FAM averages the CFA across different trajectories, the bias becomes negligible compared to\\nthe benefits of variance reduction.\\n3 Experiments\\n3.1 Datasets\\nEvaluating RL-based recommender systems is challenging. The most reliable metric involves online A/B tests, but these are often\\ntoo costly and risky for comparing all baselines in an online system. Offline evaluation of long-term utility using user logs is difficult\\nbecause we lack feedback for actions not present in the log. To thoroughly assess the performance of the proposed systems, we\\nfollow previous works and construct simulators. However, instead of synthetic simulators, we use real-data-driven simulators. The\\ndatasets used include MovieLens, Netflix Prize, and NewsFeed.\\n• MovieLens: This dataset contains 5-star rating activities from MovieLens. User behavior corresponds to star ratings, with\\nrewards matching these ratings. There are three types of features: movie-id, movie-genre, and movie-tag.\\n• Netflix Prize: This dataset consists of 5-star ratings from Netflix. Rewards follow the same setup as MovieLens. It includes\\nonly one type of feature: movie-id.\\n• NewsFeed: This dataset is collected from a real online news recommendation system. We focus on predicting the dwelling\\ntime on clicked news, partitioned into 12 levels, each corresponding to a different user behavior. Rewards range from\\n1 to 12. There are seven types of features: news-id, news-tag, news-title, news-category, news-topics, news-type, and\\nnews-source.\\n3.2 Experimental Settings\\nTo ensure a fair evaluation, it is crucial to prevent the agent in the evaluated system from exploiting the simulator. We implement\\ntwo specific settings in the evaluation process. First, all agents are restricted to using only a subset of features, while the simulator\\nuses the full feature set. In MovieLens and Netflix, agents use only the movie-id feature. In NewsFeed, agents use four out of seven\\nfeatures (news-id, category, news-type, and news-source). Second, we intentionally set the model architecture of the simulator to\\ndiffer from that of the agents. We use LSTM units for the simulators, while agents use GRU units.\\nTo gauge the simulator’s accuracy, we report micro-F1, weighted-F1, and RMSE for user behavior classification. The properties of\\nthe datasets and simulators are detailed in Table 2. For the NewsFeed dataset, we also analyzed over 400 historical A-B test records.\\nThe correlation between our simulator’s predictions of long-term rewards (e.g., total clicks or session dwelling time) and the actual\\noutcomes is above 0.90.\\n33.2.1 Evaluation Settings\\nThe evaluation process consists of two types of iterations: training rounds and test rounds. During a training round, the agent\\ngenerates actions using an ε-greedy policy (ε = 0.1 for all experiments) and updates its policy based on feedback from the simulator.\\nIn the test round, the agent uses a greedy policy, and the generated data is not used for training. Each session in both training and test\\nrounds involves 20 steps of interaction between the simulator and the agent. Each round includes 256,000 sessions.\\nFor each experiment, we report the average reward per session in the test round, calculated as the sum of rewards over all sessions in\\nthe test round divided by the number of sessions. Each experiment is repeated three times with different random seeds, and we\\nreport the mean and variance of the scores. We simulate both Batch RL and Growing Batch-RL evaluations separately. In Batch RL\\nevaluation, the agent trains only on static user logs and interacts with the simulator during testing. In Growing Batch RL evaluation,\\nthe agent interacts with the simulator during both training and test rounds, with the training round repeating up to 40 times.\\n3.3 Methods for Comparison\\nWe compare various methods, including Supervised Learning (GRU4Rec), bandits (GRU4Rec (ε-greedy)), MFRL (MCPE, DQN,\\nDDQN, and DDPG), and MBRL (Dyna-Q). For bandits, LinUCB is a common baseline, but it performs poorly in our environments\\ndue to the limited representational power of linear models. Therefore, we use the ε-greedy version of NN models (GRU4Rec\\n(ε-greedy)) instead of LinUCB.\\nThe methods for comparison are:\\n• GRU4Rec: Uses GRU to encode interactive history to predict immediate user behavior, with an architecture equivalent to\\nthe environment model. We use entropy loss in GRU4Rec.\\n• GRU4Rec ( ε-greedy): Applies ε-greedy item selection in GRU4Rec during training rounds.\\n• DQN: A classic off-policy learning algorithm. We use GRU for state representation to ensure fair comparison, similar to\\nGRU4Rec and our method.\\n• DDQN: Double DQN, which uses a different action selection for value backup to avoid value overestimation in off-policy\\nlearning. The model architecture is equivalent to GRU4Rec.\\n• DDPG: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, an off-policy learning algorithm for continuous action spaces. The inferred\\naction selects the nearest neighbor item for display. We use the same neural structure as GRU4Rec for both actor and critic\\nnetworks.\\n• MCPE: Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation, a straightforward value iteration algorithm using the whole trajectory for value\\nbackup. The model architecture is the same as other baselines.\\n• Dyna-Q: An MBRL method that augments DQN with imagined rollouts from an environment model. The ratio of imagined\\nrollouts to real trajectories is 1:1.\\n• MBCAL: The full version of our proposed method.\\n• MBCAL (w/o variance reduction): An ablated version of MBCAL where we use SFR instead of CFA as the label for FAM.\\nAll parameters are optimized using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10-3, β1 = 0.9, and β2 = 0.999. The discount factor for\\nlong-term rewards is γ = 0.95. Embedding sizes for item-id and other id-type features are set to 32. The hidden size for MLP is 32.\\nFor training MEM in MBCAL, we use pmask = 0.20 to generate masked trajectories. In DDPG, we use a 4-dimensional action space\\ndue to poor performance with higher dimensions, and an additional layer maps item representations to this 4-dimensional space.\\n3.4 Experimental Results\\n3.4.1 Results of Batch-RL Evaluation\\nThe results of the Batch-RL evaluation are presented in Table 3. We evaluate the reward per session based on the rewards generated\\nby the simulator. The results indicate that MFRL methods cannot outperform MBRL methods across all three environments. Due to\\nits sample inefficiency, MFRL tends to exhibit poor initial performance. Notably, DDPG demonstrates the weakest performance\\nacross all environments. Upon closer examination of the value functions in DDPG, we observed significant overestimation compared\\nto other MFRL methods. This overestimation likely arises from value backups based on continuous actions that may not correspond\\nto actual items.\\nAs anticipated, MBCAL outperforms all other tested systems by substantial margins, showcasing its sample efficiency. However, the\\nadvantage of our method over the supervised learning method is less pronounced in the MovieLens and Netflix datasets compared to\\nNewsFeed. This suggests that long-term rewards play a more significant role in the NewsFeed environment.\\nFurthermore, while learning to predict long-term utility requires more data than immediate rewards, the dominance of RL is not\\nyet fully apparent in Batch-RL settings. Nevertheless, it is crucial that MBCAL’s initial performance is already state-of-the-art,\\nunderscoring its low risk and high sample efficiency.\\n4Table 1: Average reward per session of different algorithms and datasets in Batch-RL evaluation.\\nAlgorithms MovieLens Netflix NewsFeed\\nGRU4Rec 77.93 ± 0.06 79.63 ± 0.02 11.58 ± 0.14\\nDDPG 70.99 ± 0.70 72.50 ± 0.35 10.90 ± 0.42\\nDQN 77.27 ± 0.06 77.75 ± 0.01 12.44 ± 0.33\\nDDQN 77.23 ± 0.02 77.70 ± 0.04 12.48 ± 0.17\\nMCPE 77.20 ± 0.10 77.70 ± 0.03 13.21 ± 0.53\\nDyna-Q 77.25 ± 0.05 77.81 ± 0.02 13.04 ± 0.33\\nMBCAL 78.02 ± 0.03 79.71 ± 0.04 16.32 ± 0.24\\nMBCAL (w/o variance reduction) 77.70 ± 0.04 79.50 ± 0.04 15.61 ± 0.38\\nTable 2: Properties of Datasets and Simulators.\\nProperties MovieLens Netflix NewsFeed\\n# of Users 130K 480K 920K\\n# of Items 20K 17K 110K\\n# of Different Labels 6 6 12\\n# of Types of Features 3 1 7\\nSize of Training Set 2.48M 4.53M 9.41M\\nSize of Validation Set 1.27M 2.27M 4.70M\\nSimulator Macro-F1 0.545 0.511 0.923\\nSimulator Weighted-F1 0.532 0.498 0.887\\nSimulator RMSE 0.770 0.848 1.810\\n3.4.2 Results of Growing Batch-RL Evaluation\\nIn all environments, GRU4Rec(ε-greedy) slightly outperforms the purely supervised GRU4Rec, highlighting the advantages of\\nexploration in online systems. The performance of DDPG remains surprisingly poor across all three environments.\\nWith the aid of the environment model, Dyna-Q initially gains some advantages but gradually diminishes as learning progresses.\\nThis observation aligns with expectations since the virtual experience loses its benefits as sufficient real user feedback accumulates.\\nMBCAL maintains its performance lead over other methods in all environments. Even in Netflix and MovieLens, where other\\nRL-based systems fail to outperform traditional GRU4Rec, MBCAL achieves a considerable margin. In NewsFeed, where long-term\\nrewards are more critical, MBCAL further extends its lead.\\nMCPE, DQN, DDQN, and Dyna-Q lag behind other methods, including supervised learning baselines in MovieLens and Netflix, but\\nnot in NewsFeed. Investigating further, we modified GRU4Rec to output the immediate reward instead of user behavior classification,\\nturning the task into regression and replacing entropy loss with mean square error loss. This change resulted in a significant\\nperformance drop in GRU4Rec, aligning more closely with the NewsFeed results. These findings suggest that classification and\\nentropy loss benefit the system more than regression, and that user behavior contains richer information than rewards, giving MBRL\\nan edge over MFRL.\\n3.4.3 Analysis of the variance\\nThe critical aspect of MBCAL is variance reduction through counterfactual comparisons. Previous research indicates that the\\nmean square error (MSE) in a well-trained model comprises model bias and label variance (noise). Since we use equivalent neural\\narchitectures across all comparison methods, they share the same model bias. Thus, the MSE is primarily influenced by noise. To\\nassess whether CFA effectively reduces variance, we compare the MSE from the value backup equation and the CFA equation. We\\nanalyze the MSE of MCPE, DQN, Dyna-Q, MBCAL (w/o variance reduction), and MBCAL using interactive logs from the test\\nround of Batch-RL evaluation.\\nTable 3: The mean square error (MSE) loss of different algorithms in different environments.\\nAlgorithms MovieLens Netflix NewsFeed\\nDQN 1.50 1.22 4.29\\nMCPE 17.1 9.21 46.9\\nDyna-Q 0.94 1.04 7.87\\nMBCAL 0.004 0.009 0.07\\nMBCAL (w/o variance reduction) 3.45 3.29 3.07\\n5The average MSE is presented in Table 4. Consistent with theoretical analysis, longer horizon value backups exhibit higher variance.\\nMCPE has a higher variance than DQN and Dyna-Q due to using the entire trajectory for backup. MBCAL (w/o variance reduction)\\nhas the second-largest variance, lower than MCPE because the environment model’s simulated rollout partially eliminates noise.\\nDQN and Dyna-Q have smaller variances due to one-step value backup. Compared to other methods, MBCAL shows significantly\\nlower variance, confirming the expected variance reduction.\\n4 Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, our work focuses on sequential decision-making problems in recommender systems. To maximize long-term utility,\\nwe propose a sample-efficient and variance-reduced reinforcement learning method called MBCAL. This method incorporates a\\nmasked environment model to capture immediate user behavior and a future advantage model to predict future utility. By employing\\ncounterfactual comparisons, MBCAL significantly reduces learning variance. Experiments conducted on real-data-driven simulations\\ndemonstrate that our proposed method surpasses existing approaches in both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Future\\nwork could involve theoretically calculating the error bound and extending the fixed horizon settings to infinite and dynamic horizon\\nrecommender systems.\\n6'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'An Investigation into Named Entity Recognition for\\nCall Center Transcripts to Ensure Privacy Law\\nCompliance\\nAbstract\\nThis study explores the application of Named Entity Recognition (NER) on a\\nnovel form of user-generated text, specifically call center conversations. These\\ndialogues present unique challenges, blending the complexities of spontaneous\\nspeech with issues specific to conversational Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR),\\nsuch as inaccuracies. By employing a custom corpus with manual annotations,\\ntraining contextual string embeddings, and implementing a BiLSTM-CRF model,\\nwe achieve results that are on par with the state-of-the-art for this new task.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper addresses the crucial need to identify and handle sensitive personal information within\\ncall center transcripts, which are generated as a result of speech recognition systems. Although these\\ntranscripts are typically redacted for Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, they still often contain\\na caller’s name and internal ID number, which can be useful for quality assurance. However, new\\nprivacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, establish stringent\\nguidelines concerning data collection, storage, and an individual’s right to withdraw consent for\\ndata usage. To adhere to these regulations without losing the data’s value, it is essential to pinpoint\\nnon-public personal and personally identifiable information (NPI/PII) in call transcripts.\\nWe utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) to locate instances of NPI/PII within the transcripts,\\nremove them, and replace them with appropriate tags that denote the type of removed data. For\\ninstance, a transcript such as \"This is john doe reference number 12345\" would be transformed into\\n\"This is [NAME] reference number [NUMBER]\". This task is distinctive to call centers for several\\nreasons. First, these transcripts consist of natural human conversations, which have many common\\nproblems of user-generated content such as incomplete sentences and unusual words. Furthermore,\\ntranscript text is produced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which are susceptible to\\nerrors, as will be described in Section 3.1. Even though modern ASR systems are usually reliable, the\\nsource audio is from phone calls, which is often low quality and contains background noise. The poor\\naudio quality leads to incorrect ASR, producing ungrammatical sentences. This makes understanding\\nthe call semantics and identifying features essential to NER systems more difficult. Moreover, call\\ntranscripts frequently lack capitalization, numeric digits, and proper punctuation, which are crucial\\nfeatures for classic NER methods. Also, traditional NER systems are inadequate for handling emails,\\naddresses, or spellings, which makes it difficult to use pre-trained NER models.\\nIn this paper, we apply the current best neural network architecture for sequence labeling, a BiLSTM-\\nCRF, to the task of identifying NPI and PII in call transcripts. We match the state-of-the-art perfor-\\nmance on standard datasets by using our model with annotated data and custom contextual string\\nembeddings.2 Related Work\\nNamed Entity Recognition has become a focus in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP),\\nparticularly since the Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) in the 1990s. The CoNLL2003\\nshared task in 2003 concentrated on language-independent NER and popularized feature based\\nsystems. The OntoNotes corpus, released in 2006, has been vital to the progress of NER research.\\nFollowing the CoNLL task, Conditional Random Field (CRF) based models became the most\\nsuccessful, which requires that features be manually produced. Current research utilizes neural\\nnetworks to generate these features. Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory models with a CRF layer\\n(BiLSTM-CRF) have been used successfully on CoNLL2000 and CoNLL2003 datasets. A BiLSTM-\\nCNN-CRF has been used for NER on the CoNLL2003 dataset, producing superior results. Similar\\nresults were achieved by a BiLSTM-CNN with features from word embeddings and the lexicon.\\nEmbeddings have been used for both words and entity types to create more robust models. Flair, with\\ncharacter-based embeddings and a pooling approach, has set the state of the art. Crossweigh uses\\nFlair embeddings to address mishandled annotations.\\nIn 2006, the word confidence scores from ASR systems were used as a feature for NER. Similar\\nexperiments were done on French radio and TV audio. Neither of those used natural conversation,\\nand the quality of the audio was superior, making ASR a more accurate task.\\n2.1 Conversations are Different: The Twitter Analogy\\nMuch of the past research has used newswire datasets. While newswire data is expected to conform\\nto standard text conventions, call center transcripts do not have these conventions. This presents a\\nproblem for the usual approaches to NER and is further complicated by our poor audio quality.\\nSpeaker 1: Thank you for calling our company how may i help you today.\\nSpeaker 2: Id like to pay my bill.\\nTable 1: An example of turns of a conversation, where each person’s line in the dialogue represents\\ntheir turn. This output matches the format of our data described in Section 3.\\nThe most similar research area to this is work on Twitter data. Similar to our transcripts, tweets are\\nuser-generated and may not have conventional grammar or spelling. Initial research tackled this\\nproblem with a K-nearest neighbors model combined with a CRF. A model combining a multi-step\\nneural network with a CRF output layer achieved first place in the 2017 Workshop on Noisy User-\\ngenerated Text (W-NUT). The success of pooled contextualized string embeddings was also shown\\nwith this data. We use prior work on tweets to direct our model creation for call center data.\\n3 Data\\nOur dataset includes 7,953 training, 500 validation, and 534 test samples. Each sample represents\\na complete speaker turn from a debt collection call center. A speaker turn is defined as a complete\\ntranscription from one speaker before another speaker starts, as shown in Table 1. The training set is\\na random sample of turns from 4 months of call transcripts. The transcripts were generated using a\\nproprietary speech recognition system, which outputs all lowercase transcripts without punctuation\\nor numeric digits. We used spaCy to convert each turn to a document that begins with a capital letter\\nand ends with a period, as this is the default for spaCy. In order to make use of entities, a Sentencizer\\nmodule was added, which defaults to this capitalization and period structure.\\n3.1 Data Annotation\\nWe created a schema for annotating the training and validation data with different types of NPI/PII,\\nwhich are shown in Table 2.\\nInitial annotations were performed using Doccano. The annotators were trained in NPI/PII recognition,\\nand were instructed to err on the side of caution in unclear instances. Ambiguity often came from\\nerrors in the ASR model. The lack of audio meant it was sometimes unclear if \"I need oak leaves\"\\nwas actually \"Annie Oakley\". The opposite was also true such as when \"Brilliant and wendy jeff to\\n2Entity Type Description\\nNUMBERS A sequence of numbers related to a customer’s information (e.g. phone numbers or internal ID number)\\nNAME First and last name of a customer or agent\\nCOMPANY The name of a company\\nADDRESS A complete address, including city, state, and zip code\\nEMAIL Any email address\\nSPELLING Language that clarifies the spelling of a word (e.g. \"c as in cat\")\\nTable 2: A brief description of our annotation schema.\\nprocess the refund\" was actually \"Brilliant and when did you want to process the refund\". Emails\\nwere also difficult, as errors in ASR made it difficult to determine the bounds of the email address.\\nAlso, the transcripts were pre-redacted for PCI compliance. This redaction can obscure important\\ndata, for example, sometimes a customer ID is redacted as part of the PCI redaction process. To\\nlessen false negatives, we use context to include the [redacted] tag as part of the numbers sequence\\nwhen possible. No steps to clean the transcripts were taken; the natural noise in the data was left for\\nthe model to interpret.\\nDue to limitations with spaCy and the complexity of nested entities, we only allowed one annotation\\nper word in the dataset. This means, for instance, that \"c a t as in team at gmail dot com\" would be\\nlabeled either as SPELLING[0:6] EMAIL[6:] or as EMAIL[0:] with the indices corresponding to the\\nposition of words in the text. This ultimately results in a lower count of SPELLING entities, because\\nthese are often part of EMAIL or ADDRESS entities, which influences our analysis in Section 6.\\n4 Model Design\\nWe utilized a standard BiLSTM-CRF model in PyTorch, adapted from a GitHub repository. We wrote\\nour own main.py to use our spaCy preprocessing, and adapted the code to handle batch processing.\\nAfter preprocessing, we trained the model on the training set and used the validation set for model\\ntuning. All numbers in this paper are reported on the test set. A visualization of our model is shown\\nin Figure 1.\\n5 Experiments\\n5.1 Basic Hyperparameter Tuning\\nWe used a grid search algorithm to maximize model performance. The word embedding layer uses\\nFastText embeddings trained on the client’s call transcripts. This aids in mitigating the impacts of\\npoor ASR, and this will be explored in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. The grid search included the parameters:\\nepochs (a sampled distribution between 5 and 50), the size of a dropout layer (between 0 and 0.5,\\nwith 0.1 intervals of search), the number of hidden layers (between 5 and 20 in increments of 5), and\\nthe encoding type used in the output of the CRF (BIO, BILOU, IO). The other hyperparameters were\\na learning rate of .001, a batch size of 1, 30 nodes in each fully connected layer, and the inclusion of\\nbias in each layer. The experiments were run in parallel on a virtual machine with 16 CPUs and 128\\nGB of memory. Each experiment took a few hours to run.\\nTo understand the performance of the model, we broke down the measurements of precision, recall,\\nand F1 by entity type. Table 3 shows these results for the best model configuration. This model used\\n46 epochs, a dropout rate of 0.2, 5 hidden layers, and a BIO encoding.\\n5.2 Training Word Embeddings\\nMost past research has fine-tuned existing word embeddings, but the task of mitigating misrecognition\\nseemed more complex than domain adaptation. To lessen the impact of the errors, we understand that\\nfrequent misrecognitions appear in contexts similar to the intended word. A custom model gives a\\nmisrecognized word a vector similar to the word it should be and not to the other meaning it has. The\\nimportance of domain specific word embeddings when using ASR data has been shown in research.\\n3We ran our best performing model with the 300 dimensional GloVe 6b word embeddings. Our\\nembeddings were trained on roughly 216 million words. The results from the best epoch of this\\nmodel (16) are shown in Table 3.\\n2*Entity Type Precision Recall F1\\nCustom GloVe Custom GloVe Custom GloVe\\nO 89.8 84.2 81.7 76.6 85.6 80.2\\nNUMBERS 95.6 88.7 85.4 82.9 90.1 85.7\\nNAME 89.6 92.1 91.1 88.7 90.3 90.3\\nCOMPANY 98.8 99.5 72.9 64.3 83.9 78.1\\nADDRESS 70.6 0.3 75.0 18.7 72.7 23\\nEMAIL 0 07.1 0 03.1 0 04.4\\nSPELLING 45.8 34 52.4 40.5 48.9 37.0\\nMicro Average 89.2 85.6 79.6 74.0 84.1 79.4\\nTable 3: The performance by entity type of the BiLSTM-CRF model on the held out test set.

Here, we test the performance of Flair and its contextual string\\nembeddings.\\nWe begin by training custom contextual string embeddings based on the results of the first experiments.\\nWe use the same corpus as in Section 5.1. The tutorial on the Flair GitHub page was used with the\\nfollowing parameters: hidden size: 1024, sequence length: 250, mini batch size: 100. We use the\\nnewline to indicate a document change, and each turn as a separate document for consistency. The\\nmodel’s validation loss stabilized after epoch 4, and the best version of the model was used.\\nWe conduct experiments using Flair’s SequenceTagger with default parameters and a hidden size of\\n256.\\nFlair uses only the custom trained Flair embeddings.\\nFlair + FastText uses the custom trained Flair embeddings and the custom trained FastText embeddings\\nusing Flair’s StackedEmbeddings.\\nFlairmean pooling uses only the custom trained Flair embeddings within Flair’s PooledFlairEmbed-\\nding.

The Flair embeddings show a large improvement over other word\\nembeddings; however all four varieties of Flair models have nearly identical Micro Average F1s. The\\nbest performing Flair models are those that use both the custom contextualized string embeddings\\nand the custom FastText embeddings.\\nAcross all of the models in this paper, EMAIL and SPELLING consistently performed worse than\\nother categories. This is due to the overlap in their occurrences and their variable appearance. The\\ncustom embeddings model often identified parts of an email correctly but labeled some aspects, such\\nas a name, as NAME followed by EMAIL instead of labeling the whole thing as EMAIL. SPELLING\\noften appears within an EMAIL entity. Due to the previously discussed limitations, the SPELLING\\nentity had a limited presence in our training data, with many EMAIL and ADDRESS entities\\ncontaining examples of SPELLING. All models frequently misidentified EMAIL as SPELLING and\\nvice versa. Additionally, the test data had a number of turns that consisted of only SPELLING, which\\nwas poorly represented in training. The Flairmean pooling model outperforms the other models in\\nEMAIL by a large margin.\\nThe results in Table 4 highlight that the NUMBERS category contains strings that appear frequently\\nin the text. There are a finite number of NUMBER words in our corpus (those numeric words along\\nwith many instances of \"[redacted]\"), and the numbers of interest in our dataset appear in very similar\\ncontexts and do not often get misrecognized. The COMPANY entity performs well for similar\\nreasons; when the model was able to identify the company name correctly, it was often in a common\\nerror form and in a known context. The model’s failures can be attributed to the training data because\\nthe company name is a proper noun that is not in standard ASR language models, including the one\\nwe used. Thus, it is often misrecognized since the language model has higher probabilities assigned to\\ngrammatically correct phrases that have nothing to do with the company name. This causes variability\\nin appearance, which means that not every version of the company name was present in our training\\nset.\\nInteresting variability also occurred in ADDRESS entities. Both models that used Flair and FastText\\nembeddings strongly outperformed the models that used only Flair, and standard Flair embeddings\\nstrongly outperformed the Pooled Flair embeddings. Neither version of the Flair-only model identified\\naddresses in which numbers were shown as \"[redacted]\" but both models that utilized FastText had\\nno issue with these instances.\\n7 Conclusion and Future Work\\nThrough the use of a BiLSTM-CRF model, paired with custom-trained Flair embeddings, we achieve\\nstate-of-the-art NER performance on a new call center conversation dataset with distinct entity types.\\nWe also show the importance of training word embeddings that fully capture the intricacies of the\\ntask. Although we cannot release our data for privacy, we have shown that existing state-of-the-art\\ntechniques can be applied to less common datasets and tasks. Future work will include evaluating\\nthe model with call transcripts from other industries. We would also like to explore how well these\\ntechniques work on other user-generated conversations like chats and emails.\\n5'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Enhanced Image Compression Through Advanced\\nResidual Network Architectures\\nAbstract\\nThis manuscript provides an in-depth explanation of the methodology developed\\nfor a recent image compression challenge. The method primarily incorporates two\\ninnovative aspects: the application of advanced residual networks for enhanced\\ncompression and the utilization of sub-pixel convolution techniques for efficient\\nup-sampling during decompression. The efficacy of these methodologies, which\\nachieved a high Multiscale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) of 0.972 under\\na strict bit rate constraint of 0.15 bits per pixel (bpp) while maintaining reasonable\\ncomputational demands during the evaluation stage.\\n1 Introduction\\nImage compression remains a crucial research area within the field of signal processing, aiming to\\nfacilitate more efficient data storage and transfer. Conventional image compression algorithms, like\\nthe various JPEG standards, often employ manually designed encoder/decoder frameworks. However,\\nwith the emergence of novel image formats and the proliferation of high-resolution mobile devices,\\nthere is a growing recognition that existing standards may not represent the most effective or universal\\nsolutions for image compression.\\nRecently, deep learning-based techniques have shown a surge of progress in the image compression\\ndomain. Some of these methods employ generative models, trained adversarially, to effectively learn\\nthe underlying distribution of images, resulting in impressive subjective quality even at exceptionally\\nlow bit rates. Other works utilize recurrent neural networks to iteratively compress residual informa-\\ntion, enabling progressive coding which allows for multiple quality levels within a single compression\\noperation. Further advancements have been made by focusing on relaxing quantization constraints\\nand improving entropy modeling, leading to enhanced performance compared to established image\\ncompression methods.\\nNevertheless, identifying an optimal network structure presents a formidable challenge across various\\nmachine learning applications, including image compression. This paper primarily discusses two\\nimportant aspects of network design for image compression. The first concerns the selection of kernel\\nsize, a parameter that significantly influences compression effectiveness in traditional algorithms.\\nMotivated by its impact in classical methods, this paper presents experiments that use different filter\\nsizes to prove that larger kernel sizes contribute to improved coding efficiency. Building upon this, a\\nstrategy is presented that utilizes a deep residual learning approach, allowing for the maintenance\\nof a broad receptive field while utilizing a reduced number of parameters. This approach not only\\ndecreases the model’s overall size but also substantially enhances its performance. Additionally,\\nthe architecture of up-sampling operations within the decoder plays a pivotal role in determining\\nthe quality of reconstructed images and the presence of artifacts. This issue, extensively studied in\\nthe context of super-resolution, involves various implementations for up-sampling layers, such as\\ninterpolation, transposed convolution, and sub-pixel convolution. This work compares two commonly\\nused up-sampling methods, transposed and sub-pixel convolutions, to demonstrate their relative\\nperformance in the context of image compression.\\n.2 Methodology\\nThe fundamental network architectures employed in this research are based on prior works that\\nhave demonstrated state-of-the-art compression performance. The network is structured as a pair\\nof autoencoders. The primary autoencoder is responsible for optimizing the rate-distortion tradeoff\\ninherent in image compression. The loss function can be expressed as:\\nJ = λd(x, ˆx) +R(ˆy) (1)\\nwhere λ is a parameter that balances the importance of rate and distortion. The secondary autoencoder\\nhandles the encoding of side information, which is used to model the probability distribution of the\\ncompressed data. A Gaussian scale mixture approach is utilized to develop an image-adaptive entropy\\nmodel, with scale parameters conditioned on a hyperprior.\\n2.1 From Small Kernel Size to Large Kernel Size\\nIn traditional image compression techniques, the size of transform filters significantly affects coding\\nefficiency, especially for high-definition videos. Initially, transform sizes were small, but as the field\\nprogressed, there was a gradual shift towards larger sizes to better capture spatial correlations and\\nsemantic details. The experiments detailed in this paper, using a standard dataset, explore the impact\\nof different filter sizes in both the main and auxiliary autoencoders. Table 1 indicates that for the\\nBaseline architecture, larger kernel sizes lead to better rate-distortion outcomes. Similarly, Table\\n2 demonstrates comparable improvements for the HyperPrior architectures. Table 3 reveals that\\nemploying large kernels in the auxiliary autoencoder does not enhance rate-distortion performance\\nand may even negatively impact it. This is likely due to the small size of the compressed codes, which\\nmakes smaller kernels sufficient for effective encoding. An excessive number of trainable parameters\\ncan hinder the learning process.\\nTable 1: The effect of kernel size on Baseline on Kodak, optimized by MSE with λ = 0.015.\\nMethod PSNR MS-SSIM Rate\\nBaseline-3 32.160 0.9742 0.671\\nBaseline-5 32.859 0.9766 0.641\\nBaseline-9 32.911 0.9776 0.633\\nTable 2: The effect of kernel size on HyperPrior on Kodak, optimized by MSE with λ = 0.015.\\nMethod PSNR MS-SSIM Rate\\nHyperPrior-3 32.488 0.9742 0.543\\nHyperPrior-5 32.976 0.9757 0.518\\nHyperPrior-9 33.005 0.9765 0.512\\nTable 3: The effect of kernel size in the auxiliary autoencoder on Kodak, optimized by MS-SSIM\\nwith λ = 5.\\nMethod PSNR MS-SSIM Rate\\nHyperPrior-9-Aux-5 26.266 0.9591 0.169\\nHyperPrior-9-Aux-9 26.236 0.9590 0.171\\n2.2 From Shallow Network to Deep Residual Network\\nIn terms of receptive field coverage, a sequence of four 3x3 kernels can encompass the same area as\\na single 9x9 kernel but with a reduced parameter count. Initial attempts to substitute a large kernel\\nwith multiple 3x3 filters encountered convergence issues during training. To address this, shortcut\\nconnections were incorporated between adjacent 3x3 kernels. The resultant deep residual network\\n2architecture for image compression is denoted as ResNet-3x3(4), signifying that a stack of four 3x3\\nkernels achieves an equivalent receptive field to a 9x9 kernel. To minimize parameter overhead,\\nGDN/IGDN activation functions are applied only once within each residual unit when the output\\ndimensions change. For the remaining convolutional layers, parameter-free Leaky ReLU activations\\nare employed to introduce non-linearity. As indicated in Table 4, ResNet-3x3(4) surpasses both\\nResNet-3x3(3) and Hyperprior-9 in terms of performance.\\nTable 4: Comparison of residual networks and upsampling operations on Kodak, optimized by\\nMS-SSIM with λ = 5.\\nMethod PSNR MS-SSIM Rate\\nHyperprior-9 26.266 0.9591 0.1690\\nResNet-3x3(3) 26.378 0.9605 0.1704\\nResNet-3x3(4)-TConv 26.457 0.9611 0.1693\\nResNet-3x3(4)-SubPixel 26.498 0.9622 0.1700\\n2.3 Upsampling Operations at Decoder Side\\nThe encoder-decoder structure is characterized by its symmetrical design. While down-sampling at\\nthe encoder is typically achieved using strided convolution filters, up-sampling at the decoder can be\\nimplemented through various methods, such as bicubic interpolation, transposed convolution, and\\nsub-pixel convolution. Considering the importance of rapid end-to-end learning, bicubic interpolation\\nwas excluded, and a comparison was made between the two widely used up-sampling techniques:\\ntransposed convolution (TConv) and sub-pixel convolution (SubPixel). To implement sub-pixel\\nconvolution, the channel count is expanded fourfold, followed by the application of a depth-to-space\\noperation. The results presented in Table 4 demonstrate that sub-pixel convolution filters offer slight\\nimprovements in both PSNR and MS-SSIM compared to transposed convolution filters.\\n3 Experiments\\nFor the training process, 256x256 image patches were extracted from a large-scale image dataset. A\\nbatch size of 8 was employed, and training was conducted for up to 2 million iterations to ensure\\nstable convergence. Optimization was performed using the Adam optimizer, with an initial learning\\nrate of 1 x 10<sup>-4</sup>, reduced to 1 x 10<sup>-5</sup> for the final 80,000 iterations.\\nTwo primary strategies were implemented. The first strategy, termed \"Wide Bottleneck,\" involves\\nincreasing the model’s capacity by expanding the number of filters. Since increasing filters in large\\nfeature maps significantly increases computational cost (FLOPs), the filter count was only raised in\\nthe encoder’s final layer, from 128 to 192. This results in a minor FLOPs increase, as detailed in Table\\n5. While Bottleneck192 effectively reduces the bit rate, it also leads to some quality degradation\\ncompared to Bottleneck128.\\nTable 5: The effect of wide bottleneck on Kodak dataset.\\nMethod PSNR MS-SSIM Rate\\nResNet-3x3(4)-Bottleneck128 26.498 0.9622 0.1700\\nResNet-3x3(4)-Bottleneck192 26.317 0.9619 0.1667\\nThe second strategy is \"Rate Control.\" For achieving a target bit rate, two models are trained at\\ndistinct bit rates by adjusting the λ parameter.

This section analyzes the parameter count and model complexity in terms of floating-point\\noperations per second (FLOPs) for various architectures. Specifically, using the HyperPrior-9\\narchitecture as an example, Table 8 provides a layer-wise breakdown of model size. The number of\\nparameters and FLOPs are calculated as follows:\\nPara = (h × w × Cin + 1)× Cout (2)\\nFLOPs = Para × H′ × W′ (3)\\nwhere h × w represents the kernel size, H′ × W′ denotes the output dimensions, and Cin and Cout\\nare the number of input and output channels, respectively. The +1 term is omitted when no bias\\nis used. Quantization and leaky-ReLU are parameter-free. GDN operates across channels but not\\nspatial positions, resulting in a parameter count of (Cin + 1)× Cout. The total FLOPs for GDN\\nand inverse GDN calculations are minimal. This analysis primarily focuses on the backbone of\\nconvolutional layers, so the FLOPs of GDN, inverse GDN, and factorized prior are not included in the\\ncomparison. Table 9 presents a comparison of different architectures, with the last column showing\\nthe relative FLOPs using Baseline-5 as the reference. The proposed models achieve improved coding\\nperformance with relatively low computational complexity.\\n5 Conclusion\\nThis manuscript details the proposed deep residual learning framework and sub-pixel convolution\\ntechnique for image compression, forming the foundation of the submitted entries: Kattolab, Katto-\\nlabv2, and KattolabSSIM. The results demonstrate that these approaches achieve a high MS-SSIM of\\n0.972 under a bit rate constraint of 0.15 bpp, while maintaining a moderate level of computational\\ncomplexity during the validation phase.\\n4Table 8: The model size analysis of HyperPrior-9.\\n!\\nLayer Kernel Channel Output Para\\nFLOPs\\nh w Cin Cout H x W\\nconv1 9 9 3 128 128 x 128 31232\\n5.12 x 10<sup>9</sup>\\nconv2 9 9 128 128 64 x 64 1327232\\n5.44 x 10<sup>7</sup>\\nconv3 9 9 128 128 32 x 32 1327232\\n1.36 x 10<sup>7</sup>\\nconv4 9 9 128 128 16 x 16 1327104\\n3.40 x 10<sup>6</sup>\\nGDN/IGDN 99072\\n-\\nHconv1 3 3 128 128 16 x 16 147584\\n3.78 x 10<sup>6</sup>\\nHconv2 5 5 128 128 8 x 8 409728\\n2.62 x 10<sup>6</sup>\\nHconv3 5 5 128 128 4 x 4 409728\\n6.56 x 10<sup>5</sup>\\nFactorizedPrior 5888\\n-\\nHTconv1 5 5 128 128 8 x 8 409728\\n2.62 x 10<sup>6</sup>\\nHTconv2 5 5 128 192 16 x 16 614592\\n1.57 x 10<sup>7</sup>\\nHTconv3 3 3 192 256 16 x 16 442624\\n1.13 x 10<sup>7</sup>\\nlayer1 256 640 16 x 16 164480\\n4.21 x 10<sup>6</sup>\\nlayer2 640 512 16 x 16 328192\\n8.40 x 10<sup>6</sup>\\nlayer3 512 256 16 x 16 131072\\n3.36 x 10<sup>6</sup>\\nTconv1 9 9 128 128 32 x 32 1327232\\n1.36 x 10<sup>7</sup>\\nTconv2 9 9 128 128 64 x 64 1327232\\n5.44 x 10<sup>7</sup>\\nTconv3 9 9 128 128 128 x 128 1327232\\n2.17 x 10<sup>10</sup>\\nTconv4 9 9 128 3 256 x 256 31107\\n2.04 x 10<sup>7</sup>\\nTotal 11188291\\n3.88 x 10<sup>10</sup>\\n5Table 9: The model complexity of different architectures.\\nMethod Para FLOPs Relative\\nBaseline-3 997379 4.25 x 10<sup>9</sup> 0.36\\nBaseline-5 2582531 1.18 x 10<sup>10</sup> 1.00\\nBaseline-9 8130563 3.82 x 10<sup>10</sup> 3.24\\nHyperPrior-3 4055107 4.78 x 10<sup>9</sup> 0.40\\nHyperPrior-5 5640259 1.23 x 10<sup>10</sup> 1.04\\nHyperPrior-9 11188291 3.88 x 10<sup>10</sup> 3.28\\nResNet-3x3(3) 5716355 1.75 x 10<sup>10</sup> 1.48\\nResNet-3x3(4) 6684931 2.43 x 10<sup>10</sup> 2.06\\nResNet-3x3(4)-SubPixel 8172172 2.50 x 10<sup>10</sup> 2.12\\nResNet-3x3(4)-SubPixel-Bottleneck192 11627916 2.56 x 10<sup>10</sup> 2.17\\n6'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Equivariant Adaptation of Large Pretrained Models:\\nA Study on the NLC2CMD Competition\\nAbstract\\nThis paper presents an investigation into the challenges of adapting pretrained\\nmodels, specifically in the context of the NLC2CMD competition.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper addresses the critical need for effective methods to translate natural language descriptions\\ninto executable command-line instructions. The command line interface (CLI) is an important tool\\nfor software development due to its expressiveness and efficiency. While GUIs have difficulties\\nkeeping up with the rapid pace of new features in software development, CLIs provide a text-based\\ninterface to a wide range of software functionalities. The use of natural language for CLI interaction\\ncould transform how people interact with various operating systems and cloud platforms. This paper\\nexplores the possibilities of leveraging natural language to interact with CLIs making computational\\nresources more accessible to a wider range of users.\\n2 Task Description\\nThe primary objective of the NLC2CMD task is to transform a natural language (NL) description\\nof a command-line action into its corresponding Bash command. An algorithm is expected to\\nmodel the top-k Bash translations given the natural language description. This can be represented\\nmathematically as:\\nAnlc ∈ {p | p = (c, δ)}; |A(nlc)| < k\\nEach prediction from the model includes a set of Bash commands along with a confidence score,\\nδ, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. This confidence score can be utilized to filter out uncertain predictions\\nand is incorporated into the evaluation process. The default confidence is set to 1.0, indicating full\\nconfidence in the model’s prediction.\\n3 Competition Overview\\nThe competition occurred between July and November of 2020, encompassing training, validation,\\nand testing phases. A total of 20 teams registered for the competition, and among these, 9 teams\\nparticipated through the end of the testing phase. The teams were allowed 100 submissions in the\\nfirst two phases, and a maximum of 10 submissions for the final phase, with daily submission limits.\\nThe EvalAI platform was used for hosting the competition.\\n4 Data\\n4.1 NL2Bash\\nThe NL2Bash dataset was utilized, consisting of around 10,000 pairs of natural language descriptions\\npaired with corresponding command line syntax.\\n.4.2 Tellina Query Log\\nAround 1000 natural language utterances recorded from user interactions with the Tellina system was\\ncollected. Three programmers with Bash experience annotated these, resulting in multiple ground\\ntruth labels for many examples in the dataset.\\n4.3 NLC2CMD Data Collection Track\\nA parallel data-collection track was included in the competition, collecting natural language to bash\\ncommand pairs through a web interface on the competition website. 21 participants from industry\\nand academia submitted over 120 examples, which after being filtered, were part of the final phase of\\nthe challenge.\\n4.4 Data partitions and pipeline\\nThe data was filtered for each data sample through a Bash parser to ensure that only valid Bash\\ncommands were included. Any text that was not a valid Bash command or used utilities not in the\\nUbuntu 18.04 LTS command set was removed. For training, participants were provided with a filtered\\nversion of the NL2Bash dataset, as well as man pages for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. In addition, participants\\nwere allowed to use any other publicly available data for training. The data set was split into training,\\nvalidation and test sets with different sizes for each. In addition to the original utilities of the first\\nphase of the competition, 27 additional utilities were added in subsequent phases.\\n5 Metrics\\nThe submissions to the NLC2CMD competition were assessed based on two primary metrics:\\naccuracy and energy consumption. This approach was utilized to better evaluate submitted solutions.\\n5.1 Accuracy\\nThis section discusses the metrics used to evaluate the task of translating natural language to Bash\\ncode. Existing metrics such as Full Command Accuracy, BLEU score, and Template Accuracy, are\\nreviewed and it is found that they all have shortcomings. The paper presents a metric, verification\\nby execution, which is able to solve these problems. Finally, the metric that was proposed for the\\ncompetition is discussed in depth.\\n5.1.1 Existing Metrics\\nFull Command Accuracy is a metric that measures the exact match between a generated code and a\\nreference code. BLEU scores computes the n-grams of candidate translations with the n-grams of the\\nreference translation. Template Accuracy measures if the command templates match but not exact\\narguments of the command.\\n5.1.2 Verification by Execution\\nBecause Bash is a Turing complete language, the equivalence of two commands is undecidable. To\\nhandle this issue, the execution of predicted and reference commands is compared to determine\\naccuracy.\\n5.1.3 NLC2CMD Metric\\nThis paper presents a metric that ignores the arguments in the predicted commands, considers the\\norder of utilities in piped commands and penalizes excess flags.\\nSF\\ni (Cpred, Cref ) = 2∗ |F(U(Cpred)i)∩F(U(Cref )i)|\\n|F(U(Cpred)i)∪F(U(Cref )i)|\\nS(p) =maxCref\\n1\\nT\\nPT\\ni=1 I[U(Cpred)i == U(Cref )i] ∗ SF\\ni (Cpred, Cref )\\nThe overall score is then computed as follows:\\n2Score(A(nlc)) ={m axp∈A(nlc)S(p), if∃p ∈ A(nlc)suchthatS(p) > 0\\navgp∈A(nlc)S(p), otherwise\\nThis metric encourages the correct utilities and their flags, weighted by the algorithm’s reported\\nconfidence. This metric was chosen for the competition due to the constraints of a conference setting\\nand the need to focus on the core aspects of command synthesis.\\n5.2 Energy Efficiency\\nThis section discusses the metric of energy efficiency of models, and its relevance in the current\\nresearch environment. The energy consumption of machine learning models is an area of focus, with\\nthe deployment of these models, their inference phase energy consumption can outweigh their training\\ncost over time. The experiment-impact-tracker library was used to measure the energy consumption\\nof submitted solutions.\\n6 Competing Solutions\\nThe final leaderboard of the NLC2CMD competition consisted of 6 teams/entries, along with 2\\nbaselines. The leaderboard included the accuracy score, energy consumption and latency of the\\nmodels.\\nTable 1: Final leaderboard for the NLC2CMD competition, showing the accuracy score for the final\\n(test) phase, along with the energy consumed and latency for every invocation.\\nTeam Name Accuracy Score Energy (Joules) Latency (sec)\\nMagnum 0.532 0.484 0.709\\nHubris 0.513 12.037 14.870\\nJb 0.499 2.604 3.142\\nAICore 0.489 0.252 0.423\\nAINixCLAISimple 0.429 N.A. 0.010\\ncoinse-team 0.163 343.577 0.452\\nTellina 0.138 2.969 3.242\\n6.1 TF/IDF and Proposed New Baselines\\nThe team AINixCLAISimple developed several simple baselines for the task. The approach that\\nwas most successful used an information retrieval (IR) method based on Tf-IDF rankings. Several\\nvariations of this method were tested, with the addition of the AInix Archie data, pruning duplicates,\\nnormalizing NL tokens and adjusting the confidence.\\nTable 2: Results from simple IR baselines. Additions to the raw predictor are retained cumulatively\\ntop- to-bottom.\\nIR-Baseline Variation Accuracy Score\\nTf-IDF Raw 0.361\\n+ AInix Data 0.404\\n+ Prune Duplicates 0.413\\n+ Normalize NL 0.429\\n+ Adjust Conf. 0.472\\n6.2 Transformer with Beam Search\\nTeam Magnum reached an accuracy score of 0.532 using an ensemble of 5 separately-trained\\ntransformer models. Key strategies used in their approach include: Replacing command parameters\\nwith generic tokenizations, producing scores using an approximation for confidence, and testing\\ndifferent combinations of encoders and decoders.\\n36.3 Fine-tuned GPT-2 in Ensemble\\nThe team Hubris fine-tuned pre-trained transformer models, specifically, the GPT-2 architecture. The\\nNL2Bash dataset was also augmented with heuristically mined data from stack-overflow questions.\\nTwo models of different sizes and pre-training were used, and the final commands were selected by a\\nheuristic algorithm that maximized the minimal word distance between the commands.\\n6.4 Multi-Step Pipelines\\nThe multi-step approach involves combining two different models for two separate steps. The first\\nstep involves predicting the best utility, and the second step involves predicting the correct flags to\\nuse. This can be seen in the models of team jb and team coinse.\\n7 Discussion\\nThis section summarizes lessons learned and discussions with participants during the competition.\\n7.1 Metrics Revision\\nThis section discusses suggested alternatives for accuracy and energy measurements.\\n7.1.1 Suggested Alternatives for Accuracy Measurement\\nSome suggestions for future metrics include: a metric that measures semantic match instead of\\nexact command matching; restricting the range of commands covered; a metric that measures mean\\nreciprocal rank; a metric that measures session scores over multiple interactions instead of one; using\\nadaptability of algorithms; making fast retraining available; and calibration of penalties. The issues\\nof statefulness of commands, command injection, full text match and underdetermined invocations\\nare also reviewed.\\n7.1.2 Suggested Alternatives for Energy Measurement\\nThe issues with power measurement, such as reducing computation to lower peak consumption are\\ndiscussed. It is stated that measurement of total energy consumption may be a better solution. It is\\nargued whether there is even any point to measuring energy at all due to how small the amount of\\nenergy is consumed.\\n7.2 Other Enhancements\\nOther enhancements include communication of explanations to users by converting commands back\\nto natural language, and conversational interfaces to allow for more context for the system.\\n8 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, the NLC2CMD competition is discussed, including the methodology, data used and\\nthe metrics of the competition. Going forward, the feedback received will be incorporated in future\\niterations of the competition.\\n4'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'A Collaborative Painting Experience:\\nHuman-Machine Interaction on Canvas\\nAbstract\\nWe introduce a novel approach to human-machine interaction, framed as a pictorial\\ngame where artists and a computer collaborate in iterative creative rounds. The\\ncomputer uses machine learning to partially complete the artwork at each stage,\\nprojecting its additions directly onto the canvas, which the artists are then able to\\nmodify or incorporate. This process encourages creative exploration and provokes\\nquestions about the growing relationship between humans and machines.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe ongoing technological advancements are reshaping human-machine interaction, providing new\\ntools for artistic creation while simultaneously prompting contemplation on their effects on human\\ncreativity.\\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated the creative abilities of neural networks,\\nproducing aesthetically full paintings. However, in these instances, humans serve as either engineers\\nor curators. Our work introduces a new method of machine utilization, integrating it into the core of\\nhuman creative processes. While painting, this approach presents humans with different paths and\\nconcepts for their artwork. This concept is approached through a unique interactive framework.\\nThe artist duo Tina and Charly have previously investigated interaction through canvas art. To initiate\\ntheir creative work, they select a theme and depict it in dark colors on a white canvas. They then\\nstart their game. At each round, using a vocabulary of strokes and symbols, Charly anticipates Tina’s\\nemotions and thoughts in red, before responding with green strokes on the painting. These rounds\\ncontinue until both artists reach an agreement on finishing the painting. The entire process unfolds in\\nsilence, with the canvas serving as the sole medium of dialogue.\\nThe purpose of our work is to introduce artificial intelligence as a third participant in Tina and\\nCharly’s dialogue. The AI initially captures a raw representation of the painting, then processes it to\\npartially complete the work in progress, which it projects back onto the canvas. The artists then have\\nthe freedom to incorporate the machine’s suggestion in blue, a color that has not been assigned to\\neither player. The use of different colors allows for the analysis of each player’s contributions.\\n2 Methodology\\nThe engineered system includes a camera and a projector connected to a computer on a support. At\\neach computer round, the system captures an image of the painting and analyzes it to extract the\\ncanvas strokes. This pre-processing is made robust to changes in lighting, ensuring that the interaction\\ncan be used seamlessly in any studio. These strokes then feed into a neural sketcher, which produces\\nnew strokes to be added to the painting. Post-processing is used to project those additions back onto\\nthe canvas.\\nThe neural sketcher is a recurrent neural network, based on a recent improvement to the seminal work\\nof previous research. It is trained using a sequence of points and a channel encoding for stroke breaks.\\nThe sketcher produces a similar series, which is then converted back into strokes on the original\\n.painting. The network was trained using the QuickDraw data set, enabling it to create human-like\\nstrokes. For integration with Tina and Charly’s style, the learning was refined using a sketch database\\nfrom previous paintings by the artists.\\n3 Discussion\\nThe artists found the machine strokes to be surprising and suggestive of movements they would not\\nhave made on their own. Some painters have previously expressed how unintended strokes can be\\nevocative. Our installation, where the machine projects completions without physically painting, and\\nthe generative network capabilities, allows this to be explored. Furthermore, the ability to change\\nparameters, such as the learning data set, provides the artist with more control over their usage of the\\nmachine.\\nOur interactive installation can be used by anyone and aims to raise awareness and initiate thought\\nabout the interplay between humans and machines. This work highlights the need to make machines\\nhuman-friendly, while also acknowledging how technology changes human behaviors and routines.\\nTina and Charly felt like they were interacting with a full-body system, which had been designed\\nto simulate human-like painting. They experienced the machine as sometimes restricting, hard to\\nunderstand, and sometimes magical. It infused new dimensions into the painting. The feeling that the\\nmachine could be collaborative or limiting is an echo of the role of technologies in our daily lives.\\nFrom an outsider’s perspective, the machine changes their original painting style, both in the short\\nterm artworks (as seen in Figure 2), and on their long-term body of work, inspiring their machine-free\\npaintings. Even though we have made the machine’s influence explicit with its blue contributions, the\\ninteraction is not neutral.\\n4 Acknowledgments\\nThe authors would like to thank Yana Hasson and Yann Labbé for coding insights, Erwan Kerdreux\\nfor art history discussions, and Thomas Lartigue for general discussions.\\n2'},\n",

Moreover, the xray has been\\nfound to have a profound\\n3 Methodology\\nThe methodology employed in this study was largely influenced by the art of baking croissants,\\nwhich involves a delicate balance of ingredients and techniques to produce a flaky, yet crispy, texture.\\nSimilarly, our approach to analyzing xray data required a nuanced understanding of the intricacies\\ninvolved in signal processing, as well as a deep appreciation for the works of 19th-century French\\nimpressionist painters. The intersection of these two seemingly disparate fields allowed us to develop\\na novel framework for identifying patterns in xray images, which we term \"Flux Capacitor Analysis\"\\n(FCA). FCA involves the application of a specially designed algorithm that takes into account\\nthe spatial relationships between pixels, as well as the cognitive biases of the human brain when\\ninterpreting visual data.\\nThe development of FCA was a painstaking process that involved numerous iterations and refinements,\\nnot unlike the process of perfecting a recipe for chicken parmesan. Initially, we began by examining\\nthe properties of various types of cheese, including mozzarella, cheddar, and feta, in order to better\\nunderstand the role of casein in xray image formation. This led us to investigate the acoustic properties\\nof different materials, such as copper, aluminum, and titanium, which in turn revealed a surprising\\nconnection between the harmonic series and the structure of xray waves. As we delved deeper into\\nthis research, we found ourselves drawn into a labyrinthine world of fractal geometry, chaos theory,\\nand the works ofJames Joyce.\\nOne of the key challenges we faced in developing FCA was reconciling the theoretical foundations\\nof xray physics with the practical realities of data analysis. To address this, we turned to the\\nfield of ancient Greek philosophy, specifically the concept of Platonic realism, which posits that\\nabstract entities such as numbers and geometric shapes have a real, albeit immaterial, existence. By\\nanalogizing xray waves to the Platonic forms, we were able to develop a more intuitive understanding\\nof the underlying mechanisms governing xray image formation. Furthermore, this approach allowed\\nus to incorporate elements of cognitive psychology and sociology into our analysis, as we recognized\\nthat the interpretation of xray data is often influenced by social and cultural factors.\\nIn addition to the theoretical underpinnings of FCA, our methodology also involved the development\\nof a custom-built xray imaging system, which we dubbed the \"XRS-1000.\" The XRS-1000 features a\\nnovel combination of optical and electromagnetic components, including a high-intensity xenon lamp,\\na helium-cooled superconducting magnet, and a specialized detector array based on the principles\\nof quantum entanglement. This system allowed us to acquire high-resolution xray images with\\nunprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution, which in turn enabled us to apply FCA to a wide\\nrange of samples, including biological tissues, metallic alloys, and even certain types of extraterrestrial\\nrocks.\\nThe XRS-1000 was designed and constructed in collaboration with a team of expert engineers and\\ntechnicians, who brought a wealth of experience in fields ranging from aerospace engineering to\\npastry arts. The system’s development was a truly interdisciplinary effort, involving contributions\\nfrom materials scientists, computer programmers, and even a professional snail trainer. As we worked\\nto refine the XRS-1000, we encountered numerous technical challenges, including issues with thermal\\nmanagement, electromagnetic interference, and the occasional malfunction of the system’s coffee\\ndispenser. Nevertheless, through perseverance and creative problem-solving, we were ultimately able\\nto overcome these hurdles and produce a functioning xray imaging system that has far exceeded our\\ninitial expectations.\\nThe application of FCA to xray image analysis has numerous potential benefits, including improved\\ndiagnostic accuracy, enhanced materials characterization, and even the possibility of detecting\\nhidden patterns and structures in xray data. To explore these possibilities, we conducted a series of\\nexperiments using the XRS-1000, which involved imaging a diverse range of samples, from human\\nbones and teeth to metallic foils and even a fragment of the Wright brothers’ Flyer. The results of\\nthese experiments were nothing short of astonishing, revealing complex patterns and relationships\\n6that had previously gone unnoticed. For example, we discovered that the xray images of certain types\\nof crystals exhibit a strange, almost musical, quality, with harmonic patterns and resonances that\\nseem to defy explanation.\\nAs we continued to analyze the xray data, we began to notice a series of anomalous features and\\nartifacts that appeared to be related to the FCA algorithm itself. These anomalies took many forms,\\nincluding strange, glowing orbs that seemed to float in mid-air, as well as intricate, lace-like patterns\\nthat resembled the branching structures of trees or rivers. At first, we suspected that these features\\nwere simply the result of instrumental errors or software glitches, but as we delved deeper into the\\ndata, we realized that they were, in fact, an integral part of the xray signal itself. This led us to\\npropose a new theory of xray physics, which we term \"Quantum Flux Dynamics\" (QFD), and which\\nposits that xray waves are capable of interacting with the human consciousness in ways that are still\\nnot fully understood.\\nThe implications of QFD are far-reaching and profound, suggesting that xray imaging may be more\\nthan just a passive, observational technique, but rather an active, participatory process that involves a\\ncomplex interplay between the xray source, the sample, and the observer. This idea challenges many\\nof our traditional assumptions about the nature of reality and the role of the observer in scientific\\ninquiry, and raises important questions about the limits of knowledge and the boundaries of human\\nperception. As we continue to explore the mysteries of xray physics and the secrets of the human\\nbrain, we are reminded of the wisdom of the ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle, who once said,\\n\"The whole is more than the sum of its parts.\" In the case of xray imaging, this statement takes on a\\nprofound significance, as we begin to realize that the intricate patterns and relationships that underlie\\nxray data are, in fact, a reflection of the deeper, hidden harmonies that govern the universe itself.\\nThe FCA algorithm and the XRS-1000 system have numerous potential applications in fields ranging\\nfrom medicine and materials science to astrophysics and cosmology. For example, FCA could be used\\nto analyze xray images of tumors and other diseases, allowing for earlier diagnosis and more effective\\ntreatment. Similarly, the XRS-1000 could be used to study the properties of advanced materials, such\\nas nanomaterials and metamaterials, which are being developed for a wide range of applications,\\nincluding energy storage, catalysis, and aerospace engineering. As we continue to explore the\\npossibilities of FCA and the XRS-1000, we are reminded of the importance of interdisciplinary\\ncollaboration and the need for creative, outside-the-box thinking in scientific research.\\nIn conclusion, the methodology employed in this study represents a major breakthrough in the field of\\nxray physics, and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the underlying mechanisms\\ngoverning xray image formation. The development of FCA and the XRS-1000 is a testament to the\\npower of human ingenuity and the importance of pushing the boundaries of knowledge and innovation.\\nAs we look to the future, we are excited to explore the many possibilities that this research has opened\\nup, and to continue to push the frontiers of xray physics and beyond.\\nThe use of FCA and the XRS-1000 has also allowed us to explore the properties of xray waves in\\nnew and innovative ways, including the study of xray diffraction, scattering, and refraction. These\\nphenomena are of great interest in fields such as materials science and physics, and have numerous\\npotential applications in areas such as energy production, aerospace engineering, and medical imaging.\\nFurthermore, the XRS-1000 has allowed us to investigate the properties of xray waves in extreme\\nenvironments, such as high-temperature plasmas and intense magnetic fields, which has shed new\\nlight on the behavior of xray waves in these regimes.\\nThe results of our experiments have been nothing short of astonishing, revealing complex patterns\\nand relationships that had previously gone unnoticed. For example, we have discovered that the xray\\nimages of certain types of crystals exhibit a strange, almost musical, quality, with harmonic patterns\\nand resonances that seem to defy explanation. Similarly, we have found that the xray waves produced\\nby the XRS-1000 exhibit a unique, fractal-like structure, which is characterized by self-similarity and\\nscaling behavior over a wide range of lengths and frequencies.\\nThe implications of these findings are far-reaching and profound, suggesting that xray imaging may\\nbe more than just a passive, observational technique, but rather an active, participatory process that\\ninvolves a complex interplay between the xray source, the sample, and the observer.

This paper presents a novel approach to 3D protein structure\\nprediction, leveraging a bespoke ensemble of convolutional neural networks and\\nrecurrent neural networks to capture the intricate relationships between amino\\nacid sequences and their corresponding 3D conformations. Notably, our methodol-\\nogy incorporates an unconventional component: a generative model trained on a\\ndataset of protein structures inspired by the fractal patterns found in Romanesco\\nbroccoli, which intuitively captures the self-similar properties of protein folds. By\\nintegrating this unorthodox element, our model achieves state-of-the-art perfor-\\nmance on benchmark datasets, while also demonstrating an unexpected capacity\\nfor predicting protein structures that defy conventional notions of biochemical\\nplausibility, such as a predicted structure resembling a miniature replica of the\\nEiffel Tower. These anomalous predictions, though seemingly aberrant, are posited\\nto represent previously unexplored regions of the protein structure universe, with\\npotential implications for the discovery of novel therapeutics and our fundamental\\nunderstanding of the universe itself.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe prediction of 3D protein structures is a fundamental challenge in the field of structural biology,\\nwith significant implications for drug discovery and development. Proteins are complex molecules\\nthat perform a wide range of biological functions, and their three-dimensional structure is crucial\\nfor understanding their behavior and interactions. However, determining the 3D structure of a\\nprotein experimentally can be a time-consuming and costly process, making it essential to develop\\ncomputational methods that can accurately predict protein structures.\\nRecently, deep learning techniques have emerged as a promising approach for protein structure\\nprediction, leveraging large datasets of known protein structures to train neural networks that can\\npredict the 3D coordinates of amino acids in a protein. These methods have shown remarkable\\naccuracy in certain cases, but they are not without their limitations. For instance, some studies have\\nreported that deep learning models can be biased towards predicting structures that are similar to\\nthose in the training dataset, rather than exploring the full range of possible conformations.\\nOne intriguing approach that has been proposed to address this limitation is the use of generative\\nmodels to sample from the vast space of possible protein structures. This involves training a neural\\nnetwork to generate new protein structures that are similar in structure and function to known proteins,\\nbut with subtle variations that could potentially lead to new biological insights. Interestingly, some\\nresearchers have even explored the use of chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor, to introduce\\nrandom fluctuations into the structure prediction process, with the goal of escaping local minima and\\nexploring more diverse regions of the conformational space.Furthermore, the application of deep learning to protein structure prediction has also led to some\\nunexpected and bizarre discoveries. For example, one study found that a neural network trained to\\npredict protein structures could also be used to generate novel musical compositions, by mapping\\nthe 3D coordinates of amino acids onto musical notes and rhythms. While this may seem like an\\nunrelated and even frivolous application, it highlights the remarkable flexibility and creativity of deep\\nlearning models, and suggests that they may have a wider range of uses than initially anticipated.\\nIn addition to their potential for predicting protein structures, deep learning models have also\\nbeen used to analyze and visualize the complex patterns and relationships that exist within protein\\nmolecules. This has led to a new era of \"structural proteomics,\" in which researchers use com-\\nputational methods to analyze and compare the 3D structures of thousands of proteins, in order\\nto identify common themes and motifs that underlie their function and behavior. By exploring\\nthe intricate networks and patterns that exist within protein molecules, researchers hope to gain a\\ndeeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie human disease, and to develop new\\ntherapeutic strategies for treating a wide range of disorders.\\nOverall, the application of deep learning to protein structure prediction has opened up a new frontier in\\nstructural biology, with significant implications for drug discovery and development. As researchers\\ncontinue to explore the potential of these methods, it is likely that we will see new and innovative\\napproaches emerge, some of which may seem unexpected or even bizarre, but which could ultimately\\nlead to major breakthroughs in our understanding of protein biology and function.\\n2 Related Work\\nDeep learning has revolutionized the field of 3D protein structure prediction, enabling accurate\\nmodeling of complex molecular interactions that underlie various diseases. Recent studies have\\ndemonstrated the efficacy of recurrent neural networks in predicting protein secondary structure,\\nwhile others have leveraged convolutional neural networks to identify functional sites on protein\\nsurfaces. Notably, the application of generative adversarial networks has shown promise in generating\\nnovel protein sequences with desired structural properties, potentially leading to the discovery of new\\ntherapeutics.\\nOne intriguing approach involves the use of transfer learning, where pre-trained models are fine-tuned\\non smaller, disease-specific datasets to predict protein structures associated with particular pathologies.\\nThis strategy has yielded impressive results, particularly in the context of amyloidogenic diseases,\\nwhere accurate structure prediction can inform the design of targeted therapies. Furthermore, the\\nincorporation of auxiliary information, such as protein-ligand binding affinities and gene expression\\nprofiles, has enhanced the predictive power of these models, facilitating a more comprehensive\\nunderstanding of protein function and its relationship to disease.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, researchers have also explored the application of protein structure\\nprediction to the field of xenobiology, where the goal is to design novel, non-natural proteins with\\nunique functional properties. This endeavor has led to the development of innovative algorithms that\\ncan generate protein sequences capable of thriving in extreme environments, such as high-temperature\\nor high-pressure conditions. While the practical implications of this research are still unclear, it has\\nsparked interesting discussions about the potential for life on other planets and the possibility of\\nusing protein engineering to create novel, extraterrestrial life forms.\\nMoreover, an unconventional approach has been proposed, which involves using protein structure\\nprediction as a means of generating musical compositions. By mapping protein sequences to musical\\nnotes and using predicted structures to inform the composition of melodies, researchers have created\\na novel form of protein-inspired music. Although this line of inquiry may seem unrelated to the field\\nof drug discovery, proponents argue that it can provide a unique window into the underlying patterns\\nand structures that govern protein function, potentially leading to new insights and innovations in the\\nfield.\\nThe use of reinforcement learning has also been explored, where agents are trained to navigate\\ncomplex protein landscapes and identify optimal structural configurations. This strategy has shown\\npromise in the context of protein-ligand binding, where the goal is to design small molecules that\\ncan selectively target specific protein sites. By leveraging the power of reinforcement learning,\\n2researchers have developed agents that can efficiently explore vast chemical spaces and identify novel\\nlead compounds with potential therapeutic applications.\\nUltimately, the development of accurate and efficient methods for 3D protein structure prediction\\nremains an active area of research, with significant implications for the field of drug discovery.\\nAs researchers continue to push the boundaries of what is possible, it is likely that we will see\\nthe emergence of novel, innovative approaches that challenge our current understanding of protein\\nstructure and function, and potentially lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of complex diseases.\\n3 Methodology\\nThe development of deep learning models for 3D protein structure prediction has been a pivotal\\naspect of advancing drug discovery. To tackle this complex problem, we employed a multi-faceted\\napproach, combining elements of computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement\\nlearning. Our methodology commenced with the creation of a novel dataset, comprising protein\\nstructures represented as 3D voxel grids, which were then translated into a musical composition. This\\nunorthodox approach allowed us to leverage the expressive power of music to capture the intricate\\npatterns and relationships inherent in protein structures.\\nThe musical compositions were generated using a custom-designed algorithm, which assigned specific\\nnotes and melodies to different amino acid sequences and structural motifs. These compositions\\nwere then fed into a deep neural network, trained to predict the 3D structure of the protein based\\non the musical representation. The network architecture consisted of a series of convolutional and\\nrecurrent layers, which learned to identify patterns and relationships between the musical notes and\\nthe corresponding protein structure.\\nIn addition to this primary approach, we also explored the use of an auxiliary model, trained on\\na dataset of protein structures paired with their corresponding smells. This model, dubbed the\\n\"Olfactory Prophet,\" utilized a unique blend of natural language processing and machine learning to\\npredict the scent of a protein based on its structure. While this approach may seem unconventional,\\nour preliminary results suggest that the Olfactory Prophet is capable of capturing subtle patterns and\\nrelationships in protein structures that are not immediately apparent through traditional methods.\\nTo further augment our model, we incorporated a reinforcement learning component, which allowed\\nthe network to explore different conformational spaces and discover novel protein structures. This\\nwas achieved through the use of a custom-designed game environment, where the network was\\nrewarded for generating stable and biologically relevant structures. The game environment was\\ndesigned to simulate the challenges and complexities of real-world protein structure prediction, with\\nthe network receiving feedback in the form of a \"protein fitness score\" that reflected the accuracy and\\nvalidity of its predictions.\\nThroughout the development of our methodology, we prioritized creativity and experimentation, often\\nventuring into uncharted territory and exploring unconventional approaches. While some of these\\napproaches may have seemed illogical or flawed at the outset, they ultimately contributed to a deeper\\nunderstanding of the complex relationships between protein structure, function, and prediction. Our\\nmethodology serves as a testament to the power of innovative thinking and the importance of pushing\\nthe boundaries of what is thought to be possible in the field of deep learning for 3D protein structure\\nprediction.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our AI-assisted restoration approach, we conducted a series of\\nexperiments on a dataset of medieval Gothic architectural structures. The dataset consisted of\\n500 images of various buildings, including cathedrals, churches, and castles, each with unique\\narchitectural features and levels of deterioration. We divided the dataset into training and testing sets,\\nwith 400 images used for training and 100 images used for testing.\\nOur approach utilized a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze\\nthe images and predict the original architecture of the buildings. We employed a convolutional neural\\nnetwork (CNN) to extract features from the images, which were then used to train a generative\\nmodel to produce restored versions of the buildings. The generative model was trained using a novel\\n3loss function that took into account not only the visual similarity between the restored and original\\nbuildings but also the historical and cultural context of the architecture.\\nIn addition to the standard approach, we also explored the use of unconventional methods to enhance\\nthe restoration process. One such approach involved using a swarm of drones equipped with tiny\\nchisels to physically carve out the restored architectural features from foam blocks. The drones were\\nprogrammed to work in tandem with the AI system, using the predicted architecture as a guide to\\ncarve out the intricate details of the buildings. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it allowed\\nus to explore the potential of using robotic systems to physically realize the restored architecture.\\nWe also investigated the use of virtual reality (VR) technology to immersive ourselves in the restored\\nbuildings and gain a deeper understanding of the architectural features. By donning VR headsets\\nand navigating through the restored structures, we were able to identify subtle details and nuances\\nthat may have been overlooked using traditional methods. This approach also allowed us to test the\\nrestorations in a more engaging and interactive way, providing a more comprehensive understanding\\nof the buildings’ original architecture.\\nTo quantify the performance of our approach, we used a range of metrics, including peak signal-\\nto-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and a custom metric that evaluated the\\nhistorical accuracy of the restorations. The results showed that our approach outperformed existing\\nmethods in terms of PSNR and SSIM, and achieved a high level of historical accuracy, with an\\naverage score of 8.5 out of 10.\\nThe following table summarizes the results of our experiments: Overall, our experiments demonstrated\\nTable 1: Comparison of restoration methods\\nMethod PSNR SSIM Historical Accuracy\\nTraditional approach 25.6 0.80 6.2\\nAI-assisted approach 30.4 0.90 8.5\\nDrone-based approach 28.1 0.85 7.8\\nVR-based approach 29.5 0.88 8.1\\nthe effectiveness of our AI-assisted restoration approach in restoring medieval Gothic architectural\\nstructures, and highlighted the potential of using unconventional methods to enhance the restoration\\nprocess.\\n5 Results\\nThe implementation of our AI-assisted restoration framework yielded intriguing outcomes, particu-\\nlarly in the realm of medieval Gothic architecture. By leveraging a unique blend of computer vision\\nand machine learning algorithms, our system was able to accurately identify and reconstruct damaged\\nor missing structural elements, such as vaulted ceilings, ribbed arches, and flying buttresses. Notably,\\nour approach incorporated an unconventional methodology, wherein the AI system was trained on\\na dataset of Gothic architecture-inspired fractal patterns, which enabled it to develop a profound\\nunderstanding of the underlying geometric and aesthetic principles that govern these structures.\\nOne of the most striking aspects of our results was the AI’s ability to generate novel, yet historically\\nconsistent, designs for missing elements, such as intricate stone carvings, stained glass windows,\\nand ornate column capitals. These designs were not only visually stunning but also demonstrated\\na remarkable degree of structural integrity, as verified through finite element analysis and other\\nsimulation-based methods. Furthermore, our system’s capacity for adaptive learning allowed it to\\nincorporate feedback from human experts, thereby refining its restoration proposals and ensuring that\\nthey aligned with the highest standards of historical authenticity and architectural coherence.\\nThe results of our experiments are summarized in the following table, which highlights the perfor-\\nmance of our AI-assisted restoration framework across various evaluation metrics, including accuracy,\\nprecision, recall, and mean average precision. In addition to its technical merits, our AI-assisted\\nrestoration framework also demonstrated a surprising ability to evoke emotional responses in human\\nobservers, who consistently reported feeling a sense of awe, wonder, and connection to the past when\\ninteracting with the restored structures. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced when the\\n4Table 2: Performance Evaluation of AI-Assisted Restoration Framework\\nMetric Vaulted Ceilings Ribbed Arches Flying Buttresses Overall\\nAccuracy 0.92 0.88 0.95 0.92\\nPrecision 0.90 0.85 0.93 0.89\\nRecall 0.91 0.89 0.94 0.91\\nMean Average Precision 0.89 0.86 0.92 0.89\\nAI-generated designs incorporated elements of surrealism and dreamlike imagery, which seemed to\\ntap into the subconscious mind and evoke a deep sense of nostalgia and longing. While the underlying\\npsychological mechanisms driving this effect are not yet fully understood, they undoubtedly highlight\\nthe vast and uncharted territories that await exploration at the intersection of artificial intelligence,\\narchitecture, and human experience.\\n6 Conclusion\\nThe application of artificial intelligence in the restoration of medieval Gothic architecture has\\nthe potential to revolutionize the field of historical preservation. By leveraging machine learning\\nalgorithms and computer vision techniques, it is possible to recreate and restore damaged or destroyed\\narchitectural elements with unprecedented accuracy. One potential approach to this problem involves\\ntraining a neural network on a dataset of intact Gothic structures, allowing it to learn the underlying\\npatterns and styles that define the genre. This trained network could then be used to generate\\nrestoration proposals for damaged buildings, taking into account factors such as the original materials,\\nconstruction techniques, and aesthetic sensibilities of the medieval architects.\\nHowever, a more unorthodox approach might involve using AI to generate entirely new and fantastical\\nGothic structures, which could then be used as inspiration for restoration projects. For example, a\\nneural network could be trained on a dataset of Gothic buildings, but with the addition of elements\\nfrom science fiction or fantasy, such as towering spires that defy gravity or grand halls filled with\\na labyrinthine network of staircases. The resulting structures could be used as a starting point for\\nrestoration projects, allowing architects and preservationists to push the boundaries of what is possible\\nwhile still remaining true to the spirit of the original buildings.\\nUltimately, the key to successful AI-assisted restoration of medieval Gothic architecture will be to\\nstrike a balance between preserving the historical integrity of the buildings and allowing for innovative\\nand creative solutions to the challenges posed by their restoration. By embracing the possibilities\\noffered by artificial intelligence, while also respecting the cultural and historical significance of these\\nstructures, it may be possible to create restorations that are not only accurate and authentic, but also\\nvibrant and dynamic, reflecting the needs and sensibilities of contemporary society. Furthermore,\\nthe use of AI in this context could also help to facilitate a greater understanding and appreciation of\\nmedieval Gothic architecture, allowing people to experience and interact with these buildings in new\\nand innovative ways, and thereby ensuring their continued relevance and importance for generations\\nto come.\\nThe integration of AI in the restoration process can also facilitate the involvement of a wider range of\\nstakeholders, including local communities, historians, and artists, who can contribute their knowledge\\nand expertise to the restoration effort. This collaborative approach can help to ensure that the restored\\nbuildings are not only historically accurate but also culturally sensitive and relevant to the needs of the\\nlocal population. Additionally, the use of AI can help to streamline the restoration process, reducing\\ncosts and increasing efficiency, while also allowing for the creation of detailed digital models and\\nsimulations of the restored buildings, which can be used for educational and tourist purposes.\\nIn the future, it is possible that AI-assisted restoration of medieval Gothic architecture could become\\na major area of research and development, with significant investments of time, money, and resources.\\nAs the technology continues to evolve and improve, it is likely that we will see the emergence of new\\nand innovative approaches to restoration, which will allow us to preserve and protect these incredible\\nbuildings for generations to come. Moreover, the application of AI in this field could also have\\nsignificant implications for other areas of historical preservation, such as the restoration of ancient\\nruins, historic landmarks, and cultural artifacts, allowing us to push the boundaries of what is possible\\n5and to create new and innovative solutions to the challenges posed by the preservation of our cultural\\nheritage.\\n6'},\n",

GNNs are, however, vulnerable to adversarial attacks in many\\ndifferent tasks such as node classification, graph classification, link prediction and node embeddings.\\nGiven that such attacks are able to scale to very large graphs, studying the adversarial robustness of\\nGNNs has become increasingly important. GNNs can be attacked at test time (evasion) or during\\ntraining (poisoning). However, a combined threat model that includes both evasion and poisoning\\nhas not been considered in prior literature. Such a model, is, nonetheless, plausible given the public\\navailability of graphs or those extracted from sources such as social media sites.\\nOur work is based on the concept of a symbiotic attack, which combines both evasion and poisoning\\nattacks. A symbiotic attack aims to minimize classification accuracy on a test set. The attacker is\\nconstrained by a global budget and manipulates the entire graph, rather than individual nodes. We\\nprovide a comparison of our approach against plain poisoning and evasion attacks. To this end, we\\nadapt the previous PR-BCD attack to the symbiotic threat model, which results in attacks that are\\nmemory-efficient and scalable to large graphs. Our main findings are that symbiotic attacks are more\\neffective than poisoning attacks alone, and that evasion attacks are affected by the size of the test set,\\nwhile symbiotic attacks are less sensitive to test set size. The potential improvement given by the\\nsymbiotic threat model indicates that it requires further study.\\n2 Preliminaries\\nNotation. We denote a graph by G, with n nodes, an adjacency matrix A ∈ {0, 1}n×n, and a feature\\nmatrix X ∈ Rn×d. A GNN applied to the graph is represented by fθ(G) with parameters θ. We\\ndenote the set of possible adversarial graphs that can be created from G as Φ(G). Also, Latk and\\nLtrain denote the adversarial and training objectives.\\n2.1 Adversarial Robustness of GNNs\\nAn adversarial attack on a GNN can modify the graph’s structure, by inserting or removing edges\\nand nodes, or modify the node features. This work focuses on node classification and edge-level\\nstructural perturbations.\\n.Attacks can be categorized as either evasion or poisoning. In an evasion attack, a fixed GNN (with\\nparameters θ trained on a clean graph) is targeted, and the attacker aims to solve the optimization\\nproblem\\nmax\\nˆG∈Φ(G)\\nLatk(fθ( ˆG)),\\nwhereas a poisoning attack is performed before training, aiming to degrade the performance of the\\nGNN after training. This can be described as\\nmax\\nˆG∈Φ(G)\\nLatk(fθ∗ ( ˆG)), where θ∗ = argminθLtrain(fθ( ˆG)).\\nA poisoning attack is generally more challenging. Previous work has investigated using evasion\\nperturbations as poisoning perturbations. Also, the optimization may include unrolling the training\\nprocedure to calculate meta-gradients (gradients of Latk with respect to A).\\nSince we consider only changes to the binary adjacency matrix, we define Φ(G) to include graphs\\nreachable from G after at most ∆ edge perturbations.\\n2.1.1 PR-BCD\\nOur work extends on the Projected Randomized Block Coordinate Descent (PR-BCD) attack. Simi-\\nlarly to the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack, the adjacency matrix is relaxed toP ∈ [0, 1]n×n,\\nenabling continuous gradient updates. Each entry indicates the probability of flipping an edge, with the\\nfinal perturbations sampled from Bernoulli(P). However, as the adjacency matrix grows quadratically\\nwith the number of nodes, scaling of the PGD becomes difficult with larger graphs.\\nPR-BCD uses Randomized Block Coordinate Descent (R-BCD), updating a block of P at each\\niteration. The projection step ensures the budget is enforced in expectation, i.e. E[Bernoulli(P)] =PP < ∆ and P ∈ [0, 1]n×n. After each iteration, rather than sampling the block again, the\\npromising entries of the block are kept, and only the remaining entries are resampled.\\nPGD can also be applied for a poisoning attack (Meta-PGD). In our attacks, we employ the same\\nprinciple with PR-BCD for better scalability. While we only consider a single global budget ∆, it is\\npossible to include more complex constraints when needed for a given application.\\n3 Symbiotic Attacks\\nThe Symbiotic Objective.A symbiotic attack has a similar form to the bi-level optimization problem\\nbut has an added dependence on the evasion graph G∗ in addition to the parameters θ∗:\\nmax\\nˆG∈Φ(G)\\nLpois(fθ∗ (G∗)) where θ∗ = argminθLtrain(fθ( ˆG)), and G∗ = argmax ˆG∈Φ( ˆG)Lev(fθ∗ ( ˆG))\\nHere, Lpois and Lev are separated for clarity even though they could be the same loss.\\nThreat Model.We model an attacker who aims to reduce a model’s performance on node classifica-\\ntion tasks. Our attacker has full access to the graph, has knowledge of the model’s architecture, can\\ncreate surrogate models, and can only access the trained model as a black-box. Finally, our attacker\\nhas a limited global budget of edge insertions/removals.\\nThe Sequential Attack.A simple way to launch a symbiotic attack is to divide the budget and launch\\na poisoning attack with the first half, followed by an evasion attack with the second half. In this\\nattack, the poisoning step is not aware of a future evasion, but can improve performance by reducing\\nthe classification margin of certain nodes.\\nThe Joint Attack.The poisoning attack can be designed to \"fit\" the future evasion graph by including\\nthe evasion attack in the poisoning loss. The poisoning loss is computed using the poisoned model\\nover the evasion graph. This results in a poisoning attack which not only reduces the model’s accuracy,\\nbut also makes it more vulnerable to evasion.\\nBoth the sequential and joint attacks can be instantiated using different evasion/poisoning attacks. We\\nbuild upon PR-BCD because it scales well to larger graphs. Note that the sequential attack is actually\\na special case of the joint attack, with zero iterations per inner evasion attack.\\n24 Evaluation\\n4.1 Setup\\nWe compare the symbiotic threat model with evasion and poisoning attacks, using PR-BCD to\\nimplement the evasion and poisoning attacks. These are evaluated on Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed\\ndatasets. We study the robustness of GCN, GAT, APPNP, and GPRGNN models. We also consider\\nR-GCN and Jaccard purification as potential defense mechanisms. For each dataset, we allocate 20\\nnodes of each class for the labeled training set and 10\\nTable 1: Numbers of nodes, edges, and classes in the datasets we include in our evaluations.\\nDataset Nodes Edges Classes\\nCora 2,708 10,556 7\\nCiteSeer 3,327 9,104 6\\nPubMed 19,717 88,648 3\\n4.2 Results\\nTable 2 displays the perturbed accuracy values on the test set (10 percent of nodes) for our benchmark\\ndatasets and models, averaged over 10 runs, with the standard error of the mean also shown. The\\nattacker is given a 5 percent budget of the number of edges, and this budget is split equally between\\npoisoning and evasion for the symbiotic attacks. We report the best performing of the two symbiotic\\nattacks, and also note that the symbiotic attacks are consistently stronger than the poisoning attacks,\\nand stronger than plain evasion. The symbiotic threat model is especially evident on the larger\\nPubMed graph, where the accuracy drops to almost zero, for example, using a GCN.\\n4.3 Effect of the Number of Test Nodes\\nTo highlight the differences between poisoning and evasion objectives, Figure 2 shows the perturbed\\naccuracies for evasion, poisoning, and symbiotic attacks with varying fractions of test nodes with a\\nGCN and a 5\\nAs the number of test nodes increases, evasion becomes much more challenging across all datasets.\\nAlthough poisoning and symbiotic attacks also become more difficult with more test nodes, especially\\non PubMed, they are more robust than the evasion attack. Therefore, the reduction in performance\\ncannot be explained by the attacks having to target a larger number of nodes with the same budget.\\nThe poisoning attack is less affected since it can manipulate the flow of information during training.\\nThe symbiotic attacks also benefit from this since they can reduce the base accuracy, making nodes\\neasier to misclassify during the evasion phase. The symbiotic attacks are also stronger than poisoning\\nalone.\\n4.4 Hyperparameters\\nBlock size.Figure 3 shows the results of the four attacks with varying block sizes, using a fixed 5\\npercent budget and 125 iterations against a GCN. For small block sizes, the attacks are less effective\\nsince the PR-BCD optimization can only cover a small part of the adjacency matrix. However, larger\\nblocks have decreasing marginal benefit when a large part of the adjacency matrix can be covered.\\nBudget. Figure 4 shows how all four attacks follow a similar trend when increasing budget size. On\\nPubMed, changing 5 percent of edges is enough to achieve near-zero accuracy under the symbiotic\\nmodel. This highlights the devastating effect of joint attacks, especially in larger graphs with a small\\nnumber of labeled train nodes.\\n5 Conclusion and Future Work\\nIn this work, we have introduced the symbiotic threat model for GNNs, which combines evasion and\\npoisoning attacks. We proposed two methods to generate adversarial perturbations for this model and\\n3Table 2: Average (± standard error) perturbed accuracies for the evasion, poisoning, and symbiotic\\nattacks with a 5 percent budget.

This\\nexample uses inputs and outputs in 1-D with one input-output constraint. The unconstrained network\\nconsists of a single hidden layer with a dimension of 10, ReLU activations, and a fully connected layer.\\nThe safe predictor shares this structure with constrained predictors, G0 and G1, but each predictor\\nhas its own fully connected layer. The training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space.\\nFigure 3 shows an example of applying the safe predictor to a notional regression problem with a 2-D\\ninput and 1-D output and two overlapping constraints. The unconstrained network has two hidden\\nlayers of dimension 20 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The constrained\\npredictors, G00, G10, G01, and G11, share the hidden layers and have an additional hidden layer of\\nsize 20 with ReLU followed by a fully connected layer. Again, training uses a sampled subset of\\npoints from the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space.\\nC Details of VerticalCAS Experiment\\nC.1 Safeability Constraints\\nThe \"safeability\" property from prior work can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints. The\\n\"safeable region\" for a given advisory is the set of input space locations where that advisory can be\\nselected such that future advisories exist that will prevent an NMAC. If no future advisories exist, the\\nadvisory is \"unsafeable\" and the corresponding input region is the \"unsafeable region\". Examples of\\nthese regions, and their proximity functions are shown in Figure 5 for the CL1500 advisory.\\nThe constraints we enforce in our safe predictor are: x ∈ Aunsafeable,i ⇒ Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x), ∀i.\\nTo make the output regions convex, we approximate by enforcingFi(x) = minj Fj(x) − ϵ, for all\\nx ∈ Aunsafeable,i.\\nC.2 Proximity Functions\\nWe start by generating the unsafeable region bounds. Then, a distance function is computed between\\npoints in the input space (vO − vI, h, τ), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. These are not\\ntrue distances but are 0 if and only if the data point is within the unsafeable set. These are then used\\nto produce proximity functions. Figure 5 shows examples of the unsafeable region, distance function,\\nand proximity function for the CL1500 advisory.\\nC.3 Structure of Predictors\\nThe compressed policy tables for ACAS Xu and VerticalCAS use neural networks with six hidden\\nlayers with a dimension of 45, and ReLU activation functions. We used the same architecture for the\\nunconstrained network. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture, but share the first\\nfour layers for all predictors. This provides a common learned representation of the input space, while\\nallowing each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each constrained predictor has two additional\\nhidden layers and their outputs are projected onto our convex approximation of the safe output region,\\nusing Gb(x) = minj Gj(x) − ϵ. In our experiments, we used ϵ = 0.0001.\\nWith this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeability\\nconstraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and\\n2880, respectively. Our safe predictor is smaller than the original look-up tables by several orders of\\nmagnitude.\\nC.4 Parameter Optimization\\nWe use PyTorch for defining our networks and performing parameter optimization. We optimize both\\nthe unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss function, guiding the\\nnetwork to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from the look-up tables. Each\\n5dataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split with a random seed of 0. The optimizer is ADAM, with\\na learning rate of 0.0003, a batch size of 216, and training for 500 epochs.\\n6'},\n",

intricately linked to the study of galactic formations and the migratory\\npatterns of turtles, which has led to a deeper understanding of the role of cheese in the formation\\nof sedimentary rocks. Furthermore, the analysis of fossilized tree trunks has revealed a correlation\\nbetween the growth rings and the fluctuations in the global supply of chocolate, which in turn has\\nbeen influenced by the mating habits of pandas. The notion that fossils can provide a window into the\\npast has been challenged by the discovery of a hidden city beneath the surface of the moon, where\\nancient civilizations have left behind artifacts made of a mysterious metal that can only be found in\\nthe dreams of sleepwalkers.\\nThe relationship between fossils and the stability of the global financial market has been the subject\\nof much debate, with some arguing that the discovery of new fossil species can have a direct impact\\non the value of commodities such as coffee and rubber, while others claim that the two are unrelated\\nand that the fluctuations in the market are actually caused by the movements of a secret society\\nof super-intelligent dolphins. Meanwhile, the study of fossilized footprints has led to a greater\\nunderstanding of the mechanics of time travel and the potential for humans to communicate with\\ntheir future selves through a complex system of morse code and interpretive dance.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, the field of fossil research has been revolutionized by the application\\nof quantum mechanics and the discovery of a new subatomic particle that can only be detected by\\nindividuals who have consumed a certain type of rare and exotic spice. This has led to a re-evaluation\\nof the entire fossil record and the realization that many of the most famous fossils are actually just\\ncleverly disguised examples of modern art, created by a time-traveling Picasso who was obsessed\\nwith the concept of temporal paradoxes. The implications of this discovery are still being felt, as\\nresearchers struggle to come to terms with the fact that the entire field of paleontology has been\\nturned on its head and that the true history of life on earth is far more complex and mysterious than\\npreviously thought.\\nThe search for fossils has also been influenced by the development of new technologies, such as\\nadvanced sonar and radar systems that can detect the presence of hidden fossils beneath the surface of\\nthe earth, and sophisticated algorithms that can analyze the chemical composition of rocks and predict\\nthe likelihood of finding fossils in a given area. However, these technologies have also raised concerns\\nabout the potential for fossil hunting to become a competitive sport, with teams of researchers racing\\nto find the most valuable and elusive fossils, and the possibility of fossils being used as a form of\\ncurrency in a future where the global economy is based on the trade of ancient relics.\\nIn addition to these technological advancements, the study of fossils has also been shaped by the\\ndiscovery of a lost city deep in the jungle, where ancient artifacts and fossils have been found that\\nchallenge our current understanding of human evolution and the origins of civilization. The city,\\nwhich has been named \"Zerzura\" after the mythical land of the ancient Egyptians, is believed to have\\n3been inhabited by a advanced civilization that possessed knowledge and technologies that are far\\nbeyond our own, and the fossils found there have been dated to a time period that is millions of years\\nearlier than previously thought possible.\\nThe discovery of Zerzura has also led to a re-evaluation of the role of fossils in the modern world,\\nand the potential for them to be used as a source of inspiration for artists, writers, and musicians.\\nThe fossilized remains of ancient creatures have been used as a symbol of the transience of life\\nand the power of nature, and have influenced the development of new styles and genres of art that\\nreflect the beauty and complexity of the natural world. At the same time, the search for fossils has\\nbecome a popular hobby, with many people traveling to remote locations in search of the perfect fossil\\nspecimen, and the rise of a new industry based on the trade of fossils and fossil-related merchandise.\\nThe relationship between fossils and the natural environment has also been the subject of much study,\\nwith researchers exploring the ways in which fossils can be used to monitor the health of ecosystems\\nand track the impact of human activities on the environment. The fossil record has been used to\\nstudy the effects of climate change, deforestation, and pollution, and has provided valuable insights\\ninto the complex relationships between living organisms and their environments. However, the use\\nof fossils in this context has also raised concerns about the potential for them to be used as a tool\\nfor propaganda and manipulation, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex\\nrelationships between humans, fossils, and the natural world.\\nIn recent years, the study of fossils has also been influenced by the development of new theoretical\\nframeworks that challenge our current understanding of the nature of reality and the universe. The\\ndiscovery of dark matter and dark energy has led to a re-evaluation of the role of fossils in the grand\\nscheme of things, and the realization that they may be more than just the remains of ancient creatures,\\nbut actually gateways to other dimensions and parallel universes. The implications of this discovery\\nare still being explored, but it has already led to a new wave of research into the properties of fossils\\nand their potential uses in a variety of fields, from medicine to engineering.\\nThe search for fossils has also been influenced by the rise of a new generation of researchers who are\\nusing cutting-edge technologies and innovative methods to study the fossil record. The use of drones,\\n3D printing, and virtual reality has opened up new possibilities for the study of fossils, and has\\nallowed researchers to explore and analyze fossils in ways that were previously impossible. However,\\nthis has also raised concerns about the potential for the over-reliance on technology to distract from\\nthe importance of traditional methods and techniques, and the need for a balanced approach that\\ncombines the best of both worlds.\\nThe relationship between fossils and human culture has also been the subject of much study, with\\nresearchers exploring the ways in which fossils have been used as symbols, metaphors, and motifs in\\nart, literature, and music. The fossilized remains of ancient creatures have been used to represent the\\npower of nature, the fragility of life, and the importance of preserving our cultural heritage. However,\\nthe use of fossils in this context has also raised concerns about the potential for them to be used as a\\ntool for cultural appropriation and exploitation, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of\\nthe complex relationships between fossils, culture, and identity.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, the field of fossil research has also been influenced by the discovery of\\na hidden library deep in the desert, where ancient texts and manuscripts have been found that contain\\nknowledge and information about fossils that is far beyond our current understanding. The library,\\nwhich has been named \"The Great Repository\" after the ancient library of Alexandria, is believed to\\nhave been built by a secret society of scholars and researchers who were dedicated to the study and\\npreservation of knowledge about fossils, and the texts found there have been dated to a time period\\nthat is thousands of years earlier than previously thought possible.\\nThe discovery of The Great Repository has also led to a re-evaluation of the role of fossils in the\\nmodern world, and the potential for them to be used as a source of inspiration for new technologies\\nand innovations. The fossilized remains of ancient creatures have been used as a model for the\\ndevelopment of new materials and technologies, and have inspired a new generation of researchers\\nand inventors to explore the possibilities of using fossils as a source of inspiration for their work.\\nAt the same time, the search for fossils has become a popular hobby, with many people traveling to\\nremote locations in search of the perfect fossil specimen, and the rise of a new industry based on the\\ntrade of fossils and fossil-related merchandise.\\n4The relationship between fossils and the human body has also been the subject of much study, with\\nresearchers exploring the ways in which fossils can be used to understand the evolution of the human\\nbody and the development of new medical technologies. The fossil record has been used to study\\nthe evolution of the human skeleton, and has provided valuable insights into the development of\\nnew treatments and therapies for a range of diseases and conditions. However, the use of fossils in\\nthis context has also raised concerns about the potential for them to be used as a tool for medical\\nexperimentation and exploitation, and the need for a more nuanced understanding of the complex\\nrelationships between fossils, medicine, and the human body.\\nIn recent years, the study of fossils has also been influenced by the development of new theoretical\\nframeworks that challenge our current understanding of the nature of time and space. The discovery\\nof wormholes and black holes has led to a re-evaluation of the role of fossils in the grand scheme\\nof things, and the realization that they may be more than just the remains of ancient creatures, but\\nactually portals to other dimensions and parallel universes. The implications of this discovery are still\\nbeing explored, but it has already led to a new wave of research into the properties of fossils and their\\npotential uses in a variety of fields, from physics to engineering.\\nThe search for fossils has also been influenced by the rise of a new generation of researchers who\\nare using cutting-edge technologies and innovative methods to study the fossil record. The use\\nof artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics has opened up new possibilities for\\nthe study of fossils, and has allowed researchers to explore and analyze fossils in ways that were\\npreviously impossible.

Initially, we endeavored to contextualize\\nthe dig site within a framework of Cartesian coordinates, only to realize that the spatial geometry of\\nthe excavation area was, in fact, an illusion created by a collective of mischievous, time-traveling\\nleprechauns. Consequently, our attention shifted towards the ontology of sedimentary rock formations,\\nwhich, upon closer inspection, revealed a hidden pattern of fractal geometries that eerily resembled\\nthe branching structures of fungal mycelium.\\nMeanwhile, a parallel investigation into the aerodynamics of pterosaur flight led us down a rabbit\\nhole of turbulence models and vortex dynamics, ultimately culminating in the development of a novel,\\nfossil-based theory of wingtip vortices that defied the fundamental principles of aerodynamics, yet\\nsomehow, inexplicably, worked in tandem with the resonant frequencies of crystal harmonics. As our\\nresearch meandered through the labyrinthine corridors of temporal mechanics, we stumbled upon\\nan obscure, 19th-century treatise on the art of fossilized insect preservation, penned by a mystic,\\norder-of-odd-fellows naturalist who claimed to have conversed with the spirits of petrified tree trunks.\\nThe subsequent incorporation of these esoteric insights into our methodological paradigm necessitated\\na radical reevaluation of the role of chrono-stratigraphy in fossil dating, as our findings suggested\\nthat the conventional, linear timelines were, in reality, facades concealing a labyrinthine network\\nof interdimensional wormholes, through which ancient, sentient fossils were traversing the cosmos,\\nleaving behind trails of cryptic, cuneiform inscriptions etched into the fabric of spacetime. Further-\\nmore, an exhaustive analysis of the geochemical signatures within the fossil matrices revealed an\\nuncanny correlation with the distribution of dark matter halos in the universe, which, in turn, seemed\\nto be influencing the migratory patterns of certain species of iridescent, fossil-encrusted butterflies.\\nIn a related, yet tangential, line of inquiry, we discovered that the colorimetric properties of opalized\\nfossils were, in fact, a function of the observer’s consciousness, with the act of observation itself\\ninducing a phase transition in the fossil’s crystalline structure, thereby instantiating a non-local,\\n5quantum entanglement between the observer, the fossil, and a hypothetical, Platonic realm of\\nideal, mathematically perfect forms. This realization provoked a fundamental reassessment of the\\nresearcher’s role in the scientific process, as we came to understand that our very presence at the\\ndig site was, in effect, perturbing the fossil record, introducing an element of observer-dependent\\nuncertainty that necessitated the development of novel, non-invasive, and possibly even extrasensory,\\nmethods of data collection.\\nA preliminary investigation into the application of neurolinguistic programming techniques to the\\nanalysis of fossilized trackways revealed a surprising correspondence between the linguistic patterns\\nembedded in the trackways and the distribution of prime numbers within the Fibonacci sequence,\\nwhich, when extrapolated to the realm of quantum computing, yielded a novel, fossil-inspired\\nalgorithm for factoring large composite numbers. As our research continued to sprawl across an\\nincreasingly vast, interdisciplinary landscape, we found ourselves navigating a surreal, dreamlike\\nrealm, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy were constantly blurring, and the act of\\nscientific inquiry had become, in and of itself, a form of ontological, existential, and possibly even\\ncosmic, performance art.\\nThe introduction of advanced, spectroscopic techniques to the study of fossilized plant residues\\nenabled us to detect the presence of anomalous, non-terrestrial isotopes, whose origin and significance\\nremained shrouded in mystery, yet seemed to be connected to an obscure, ancient text that spoke of a\\nlong-lost civilization, whose technology had harnessed the power of quantum fluctuations to create a\\nnetwork of stable, interdimensional portals, through which they had communed with the essence of\\nfossilized, botanical entities. In a related, yet seemingly unrelated, vein of inquiry, we discovered that\\nthe aerodynamic properties of fossilized, pterosaur wings were, in fact, a function of the underlying,\\nfractal geometry of the wing’s surface, which, when replicated in a controlled, laboratory setting,\\nyielded a novel, biomimetic material with unprecedented, self-healing properties.\\nAs our research continued to unfold, like a labyrinthine, surrealist tapestry, we encountered an array\\nof bizarre, unexplained phenomena, including the spontaneous, levitation of fossil fragments, the\\nemission of anomalous, low-frequency radiation from fossil matrices, and the appearance of cryptic,\\nhieroglyphic inscriptions on the surface of fossilized, tree trunks, which, when deciphered, revealed a\\nhidden, esoteric knowledge that had been encoded into the fossil record by an ancient, lost civilization,\\nwhose technological prowess had enabled them to transcend the boundaries of space and time, leaving\\nbehind a legacy of enigmatic, fossilized artifacts that continued to intrigue, mystify, and inspire us.\\nThe subsequent incorporation of these findings into our methodological framework necessitated a\\nradical, paradigmatic shift, as we came to understand that the fossil record was, in fact, a gateway to\\na hidden, multiverse, where the laws of physics were mere suggestions, and the fabric of reality was\\nwoven from the threads of quantum probability and ancient, mystical knowledge.\\nThe development of novel, computer-aided, fossil reconstruction techniques, incorporating elements\\nof artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cognitive psychology, enabled us to recreate, with\\nunprecedented accuracy, the appearance and behavior of extinct, fossilized species, which, when\\nextrapolated to the realm of science fiction, yielded a series of thought-provoking, philosophical\\nscenarios, exploring the potential consequences of reviving, through advanced, biotechnology, an\\nancient, fossilized ecosystem, and the implications of such a scenario for our understanding of\\nthe intricate, web-like relationships between species, ecosystems, and the planet as a whole. In a\\nrelated, yet tangential, line of inquiry, we discovered that the fossil record was, in fact, a chronicle\\nof the co-evolutionary, symbiotic relationships between species, which, when viewed through the\\nlens of network theory, revealed a complex, interconnected web of relationships, whose topology\\nand dynamics were, in turn, influenced by the extrinsic, environmental factors that had shaped the\\nevolution of life on Earth.\\nA comprehensive, comparative analysis of the fossil records from diverse, planetary environments,\\nincluding Mars, Europa, and Titan, revealed a surprising, universal pattern of convergence, wherein\\nthe evolutionary trajectories of disparate, alien species were, in fact, recapitulating the history of life\\non Earth, as if the universe itself was, in some mysterious, unexplained way, guiding the evolution of\\nlife towards a common, cosmic goal, whose nature and significance remained shrouded in mystery,\\nyet seemed to be connected to the enigmatic, symbolic language of fossilized, megastructures, whose\\nmeaning and purpose continued to elude us, like a will-o’-the-wisp, beckoning us deeper into the\\nlabyrinthine, surreal landscape of the unknown. The subsequent integration of these findings into our\\nmethodological framework necessitated a radical, Expansion of our understanding of the fossil record,\\n6as we came to realize that the history of life on Earth was, in fact, a mere, localized manifestation\\nof a far more extensive, cosmic narrative, whose threads and patterns were, in turn, woven into the\\nfabric of the universe itself.\\nThe incorporation of advanced, geospatial analysis techniques to the study of fossil distributions\\nenabled us to detect the presence of anomalous, non-random patterns, whose origin and significance\\nremained unclear, yet seemed to be connected to the distribution of certain, rare, and enigmatic, fossil\\nspecies, whose existence and behavior continued to intrigue and mystify us, like a series of, cryptic,\\nfossilized, messages from the depths of time, whose meaning and significance awaited deciphering,\\nlike a, yet, unsolved, puzzle, or a, yet, uncracked, code. As our research continued to unfold, like\\na, labyrinthine, surrealist, tapestry, we encountered an array of, bizarre, unexplained, phenomena,\\nincluding the spontaneous, levitation of fossil fragments, the emission of anomalous, low-frequency\\nradiation from fossil matrices, and the appearance of, cryptic, hieroglyphic, inscriptions on the surface\\nof fossilized, tree trunks, which, when deciphered, revealed a hidden, esoteric knowledge, that had\\nbeen encoded into the fossil record, by an ancient, lost civilization, whose technological prowess had\\nenabled them to transcend the boundaries of space and time, leaving behind a legacy of, enigmatic,\\nfossilized artifacts, that continued to intrigue, mystify, and inspire us.\\nThe application of advanced, computational models to the simulation of fossilized ecosystems enabled\\nus to recreate, with unprecedented accuracy, the dynamics and behavior of ancient, extinct species,\\nwhich, when extrapolated to the realm of science fiction, yielded a series of thought-provoking,\\nphilosophical scenarios, exploring the potential consequences of reviving, through advanced, biotech-\\nnology, an ancient, fossilized ecosystem, and the implications of such a scenario for our understanding\\nof the intricate, web-like relationships between species, ecosystems, and the planet as a whole. In a\\nrelated, yet tangential, line of inquiry, we discovered that the fossil record was, in fact, a chronicle\\nof the co-evolutionary, symbiotic relationships between species, which, when viewed through the\\nlens of network theory, revealed a complex, interconnected web of relationships, whose topology and\\ndynamics were, in turn, influenced\\n4 Experiments\\nThe querulosity of fossilized remains necessitates an examination of the ephemeral nature of disco\\nmusic, which, in turn, informs our understanding of the flumplenookian processes that govern the\\npreservation of ancient artifacts, much like the manner in which a skilled pastry chef navigates the\\nintricacies of croissant production, carefully layering dough and butter to create the perfect flaky\\ntexture, a process not dissimilar to the way in which the human brain processes the complexities\\nof quantum mechanics, particularly in relation to the fluctuational dynamics of subatomic particles,\\nwhich, incidentally, have been found to exhibit a curious affinity for the works of 19th-century French\\nnovelist, Gustave Flaubert, whose writings on the human condition continue to influence contemporary\\nthought, including the development of new methodologies for analyzing the aerodynamic properties\\nof fossilized insect wings, a field of study that has seen significant advances in recent years, thanks\\nin part to the pioneering work of researchers who have successfully applied the principles of chaos\\ntheory to the study of Ancient Egyptian dental hygiene, a topic that, at first glance, may seem\\nunrelated to the study of fossils, but, upon closer inspection, reveals a fascinating array of connections\\nand synergies, including the use of nanotechnology to create ultra-durable toothbrushes, which,\\nwhen used in conjunction with a specialized brand of toothpaste, have been shown to be remarkably\\neffective in removing plaque and tartar from the teeth of fossilized hominids, thereby providing\\nvaluable insights into the dietary habits and lifestyles of our ancient ancestors, who, as it turns out,\\nwere quite fond of consuming large quantities of fermented foods, including a type of primitive\\nsauerkraut that was made from the fermented leaves of a now-extinct species of plant, the remnants of\\nwhich can still be found in the form of fossilized impresssions, which, when analyzed using advanced\\nspectrographic techniques, reveal a complex array of organic compounds that are eerily similar to\\nthose found in the ink of the cuttlefish, a cephalopod that has been the subject of intense scientific\\nscrutiny in recent years, due in part to its remarkable ability to change color and texture, a process that\\nis made possible by the presence of specialized cells called chromatophores, which, when stimulated\\nby electrical impulses, can expand or contract to produce a wide range of colors and patterns, a\\nphenomenon that has been observed and documented in great detail by researchers who have spent\\ncountless hours studying the behavior of these fascinating creatures, often under the most challenging\\nand unpredictable conditions, including the recent experiment in which a team of scientists attempted\\n7to train a group of cuttlefish to play a simplified version of the board game, Scrabble, using a custom-\\ndesigned interface that allowed the animals to select letters and form words, a task that proved to be\\nfar more difficult than expected, due in part to the cuttlefish’s tendency to become distracted by the\\npresence of shiny objects, including the reflective surface of a nearby mirror, which, when placed\\nin the vicinity of the experimental apparatus, caused the animals to become completely absorbed\\nin their own reflections, leading to a series of unexpected and fascinating observations, including\\nthe discovery that cuttlefish are capable of recognizing and mimicking human facial expressions, a\\nfinding that has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of intelligence and\\ncognition in the animal kingdom, and which, when considered in the context of the fossil record,\\nsuggests that the emergence of complex life forms on Earth may have been influenced by a variety of\\nfactors, including the presence of certain types of minerals and nutrients in the primordial oceans,\\nwhich, when combined with the energy from sunlight and the chemical reactions that occurred on\\nthe early Earth, gave rise to the first self-replicating molecules, a process that, over time, led to the\\ndevelopment of increasingly complex organisms, including the earliest forms of life that are preserved\\nin the fossil record,

have a direct correlation with the migra-\\ntion patterns of flamingos, which in turn are influenced by the angular momentum of disco balls\\nspinning at precisely 78 revolutions per minute, thereby creating a vortex that attracts the attention\\nof extraterrestrial life forms from planet Zorgon. This phenomenon has been noted to occur only\\non Wednesdays during leap years, and is further complicated by the fact that the square root of -1\\nis actually a sentient being named Bertrand, who has a penchant for collecting vintage typewriters\\nand has been known to communicate with the spirits of deceased authors through the medium of\\ninterpretive dance.\\nMeanwhile, the results of our experiments on the effects of orange juice on the decomposition of\\nfossils have yielded some fascinating insights, particularly with regards to the role of chimpanzees in\\nthe dissemination of fungal spores that can break down the molecular structure of granite, which in\\nturn has a profound impact on the flavor profile of artisanal cheeses. It has been observed that the\\noptimal pH level for this process is precisely 7.32, which coincidentally is also the resonant frequency\\nof the Himalayan singing bowls used in ancient Tibetan rituals to summon the great lizard king, who\\nis rumored to possess the secrets of the universe and is known to indulge in excessive consumption of\\ntartan-patterned socks.\\nIn a surprising twist, the analysis of our data has revealed a statistically significant correlation between\\nthe number of fossilized mosquitoes and the average airspeed velocity of unladen swallows, which\\nin turn is influenced by the aerodynamic properties of tutus worn by ballet dancers performing the\\nchoreography of Swan Lake. This has led us to propose a new theory of fossilization, which we\\nhave dubbed \"Flumplenook’s Law of Inverse Proportions,\" wherein the likelihood of a fossil forming\\nis directly proportional to the number of bubblegum bubbles blown by a group of synchronized\\ngymnasts while reciting the complete works of Shakespeare backwards.\\nFurthermore, our research has shown that the color palette of a typical fossil is comprised of a\\nunique combination of chartreuse, puce, and burnt sienna, which are also the exact hues used in\\nthe ceremonial robes of the ancient Egyptian goat herders, who were known to possess a deep\\n9understanding of the intricacies of quantum mechanics and the art of making a perfect soufflé. This\\nhas led us to speculate that the ancient Egyptians may have had a profound understanding of the\\nspace-time continuum, which they used to communicate with their future selves through the medium\\nof cryptic messages hidden in the patterns of their intricately woven baskets.\\nThe following table summarizes our findings on the relationship between fossilization and the\\nconsumption of pineapple pizza:\\nTable 2: Fossilization and Pineapple Pizza\\nFossil Type Pineapple Pizza Consumption\\nAmmonite 3.14 slices per day\\nTrilobite 2.71 slices per hour\\nDinosaur 1.62 slices per millennium\\nIn another unexpected turn of events, our investigation into the acoustic properties of fossils has\\nrevealed that they have the unique ability to amplify the sound of whispering librarians, which in turn\\nhas been shown to have a profound impact on the growth patterns of Petunia hybrids, particularly\\nwhen exposed to the radiation emitted by faulty microwave ovens. This has led us to propose a new\\narea of study, which we have dubbed \"Fossilophonics,\" wherein the sounds emitted by fossils are\\nused to create a new form of music that can be used to communicate with extraterrestrial life forms\\nthrough the medium of resonant crystals.\\nAdditionally, our analysis of the crystal structure of fossils has shown that they possess a unique\\nproperty that allows them to absorb and store the kinetic energy of rolling bowling balls, which in\\nturn can be used to power a new generation of sustainable energy sources, such as the \"Fossil-Tron\\n3000,\" a device that uses the vibrational frequencies of fossils to generate electricity and cook the\\nperfect poached egg. This has led us to speculate that fossils may hold the key to solving the world’s\\nenergy crisis, particularly if we can harness the power of the \"Fossil-V ortex,\" a phenomenon wherein\\nthe angular momentum of spinning fossils creates a whirlpool that can be used to propel ships across\\nthe ocean at speeds of up to 300 knots.\\nMoreover, our research has revealed that the fossilization process is closely tied to the art of Extreme\\nIroning, wherein the intricate folds and creases of ironed fabrics are used to create a new form\\nof fossilized fabric that can be used to make a new generation of high-tech clothing, such as the\\n\"Fossil-Fleece,\" a material that is both waterproof and breathable, and has the unique property of\\nchanging color in response to changes in the wearer’s mood. This has led us to propose a new theory\\nof fashion, wherein the style and cut of clothing are determined by the fossilized remains of ancient\\ncivilizations, which in turn are influenced by the aerodynamic properties of winged unicorns.\\nThe implications of our research are far-reaching and have significant consequences for our under-\\nstanding of the natural world, particularly with regards to the role of fossils in the creation of a new\\nform of sustainable agriculture, wherein the fossilized remains of ancient plants are used to create a\\nnew generation of high-yielding crops that are resistant to disease and require minimal watering. This\\nhas led us to speculate that fossils may hold the key to solving the world’s food crisis, particularly if\\nwe can harness the power of the \"Fossil-Force,\" a phenomenon wherein the energy emitted by fossils\\nis used to stimulate plant growth and increase crop yields.\\nFurthermore, our analysis of the chemical composition of fossils has revealed that they possess a\\nunique combination of elements, including the rare and exotic \"Fossilium,\" a substance that has been\\nshown to have a profound impact on the human brain, particularly with regards to the development\\nof creativity and imagination. This has led us to propose a new theory of cognitive development,\\nwherein the exposure to fossils at a young age is essential for the development of artistic talent and\\nthe ability to think outside the box.\\nIn conclusion, our research has shown that fossils are not just ancient relics of a bygone era, but are\\nin fact a key to unlocking the secrets of the universe, particularly with regards to the mysteries of\\nthe space-time continuum and the art of making a perfect croissant. As such, we propose that fossils\\nbe recognized as a new form of sentient being, with rights and privileges that are equal to those of\\nhumans, and that we establish a new field of study, \"Fossilology,\" to explore the many wonders and\\nmysteries of the fossilized world.\\n10Additionally, the application of fossilized materials in modern technology has been a topic of interest,\\nas it has been discovered that the incorporation of fossilized particles in computer chips can enhance\\ntheir processing capabilities, allowing for faster and more efficient data transfer. This has led to\\nthe development of a new generation of \"Fossil-Tronic\" devices, which are capable of processing\\nvast amounts of information and performing complex calculations at speeds previously thought\\nimpossible.\\nMoreover, the study of fossilized remains has also shed light on the mysteries of the ancient world,\\nparticularly with regards to the development of language and the origins of human civilization. It\\nhas been discovered that the fossilized remains of ancient humans contain a unique genetic marker,\\nwhich is also found in the DNA of modern humans, and which is thought to be responsible for\\nthe development of language and cognitive abilities. This has led to a greater understanding of the\\nevolution of the human species and the importance of fossils in the study of human history.\\nThe potential applications of fossilized materials in modern medicine are also vast and varied, as\\nit has been discovered that the unique properties of fossilized particles can be used to create new\\nand innovative treatments for a range of diseases and conditions. For example, the incorporation of\\nfossilized particles in pharmaceuticals has been shown to enhance their effectiveness and reduce their\\nside effects, leading to the development of a new generation of \"Fossil-Based\" medicines.\\nIn another area of research, the study of fossilized plant remains has led to a greater understanding of\\nthe evolution of plant life on Earth, particularly with regards to the development of photosynthesis\\nand the origins of the first plants. It has been discovered that the fossilized remains of ancient plants\\ncontain a unique combination of elements, which are thought to be responsible for the development\\nof photosynthesis and the ability of plants to convert sunlight into energy.

As we delve into the rarefied atmosphere of paleontological inquiry, we find ourselves\\nhurtling towards a destination that is at once familiar and yet, utterly enigmatic, rather like attempting\\nto decipher the nuances of a forgotten language, such as the erstwhile tongue of the ancient Sumerians,\\nwhich, incidentally, bears a striking resemblance to the patter of a rabid squirrel navigating a\\nlabyrinthine maze.\\nThe fossils, those sentinels of a bygone era, stand as testaments to the unfathomable vastness of\\ngeological time, their calcified remains whispering secrets to the winds that have shaped the very\\nfabric of our planet, much like the gentle lapping of waves against the shores of a moonlit lake,\\nwhose tranquil surface belies the unfathomable depths that lie beneath, rather like the convolutions of\\nthe human brain, which, in its most elevated states of consciousness, can conjure visions of flying\\nelephants and gigantic, ambulatory mushrooms.\\n11Furthermore, our investigations have revealed a hitherto unknown correlation between the stratigraphic\\ndistribution of fossilized tree ferns and the aerodynamic properties of supersonic aircraft, a discovery\\nthat has far-reaching implications for the fields of paleobotany and aerospace engineering, not to\\nmention the fledgling discipline of extremophile gastroenterology, which seeks to elucidate the\\nmysteries of microbial life forms that thrive in environments hostile to human existence, such as the\\nscorching hot springs of Yellowstone National Park, where, incidentally, one can find an abundance\\nof thermophilic microorganisms that are capable of surviving in temperatures that would be lethal to\\nmost known forms of life.\\nIn addition, we have made significant strides in the development of a novel, fossil-based paradigm for\\nunderstanding the intricacies of quantum mechanics, wherein the wave-particle duality is reconciled\\nthrough the application of a hermeneutic framework derived from the study of ammonite shells and\\nthe migratory patterns of monarch butterflies, which, as it turns out, are intimately connected to the\\nfluctuations in the global supply of peanut butter, a fact that has been obscured by the dominant\\nnarratives of conventional science, but which, upon closer examination, reveals a profound and\\nhitherto unappreciated synergy between the natural world and the human economy.\\nThe confluence of these disparate threads of inquiry has yielded a rich tapestry of knowledge, replete\\nwith unexpected insights and novel perspectives, rather like the vivid, dreamlike landscapes that\\nemerge from the ephemeral confluence of clouds and sunlight on a summer’s day, which, in turn,\\nrecalls the works of the renowned artist, Salvador Dali, whose surrealist masterpieces continue to\\ninspire and bewilder art lovers to this day, much like the enigmatic smile of the Mona Lisa, which, as\\nit happens, is rumored to be a pictorial representation of the elusive, quantum-mechanical concept\\nknown as wave function collapse.\\nAs we navigate the uncharted territories of fossil research, we find ourselves confronting an array\\nof paradoxes and conundrums that defy explanation, rather like the haunting, existential questions\\nthat have puzzled philosophers and theologians for centuries, such as the nature of free will and\\nthe problem of evil, which, as it turns out, are intimately connected to the propensity of certain\\nspecies of fungi to produce hallucinogenic compounds, a fact that has been exploited by shamans and\\nspiritual practitioners across cultures and throughout history, who, in their quest for enlightenment\\nand spiritual growth, have often resorted to the use of these psychoactive substances to access realms\\nof consciousness that lie beyond the mundane, everyday world.\\nMoreover, our research has revealed a profound connection between the fossil record and the world of\\nmythology and folklore, wherein the ancient stories and legends of lost civilizations are found to be\\nintertwined with the geological history of our planet, rather like the threads of a rich, tapestry, which,\\nwhen woven together, reveal a complex, multifaceted narrative that transcends the boundaries of time\\nand space, much like the timeless, archetypal themes that recur in the works of Joseph Campbell,\\nwhose concept of the monomyth continues to inspire and inform our understanding of the human\\ncondition, which, as it happens, is inextricably linked to the fate of the planet, and the delicate,\\nsymbiotic relationships that exist between the natural world and the human species.\\nIn conclusion, our research has led us down a rabbit hole of discovery, wherein the familiar landscapes\\nof science and reason have given way to a strange, topsy-turvy world of wonder and awe, where the\\nboundaries between reality and fantasy are blurred, and the laws of physics are twisted and distorted,\\nlike a funhouse mirror reflecting the absurd, illogical beauty of the human experience, which, as it\\nturns out, is intimately connected to the fate of the universe, and the great, cosmic dance of creation\\nand destruction that has been unfolding since the dawn of time, a dance that is at once beautiful,\\nterrifying, and sublime, rather like the haunting, ethereal music of the spheres, which, as the ancient\\nGreeks believed, is the celestial harmony that governs the movements of the planets and the stars.\\nAs we stand at the precipice of this new frontier of knowledge, we are reminded of the wise words of\\nthe great philosopher, Buckminster Fuller, who once said, \"When I am working on a problem, I never\\nthink about beauty.

       "  'file_content': 'Assessing Virtual Artifact Discovery in Immersive\\nEnvironments: Reinforcement Learning Frameworks\\nfor Cultural Data Analysis\\nAbstract\\nMetaverse Archaeology represents a paradigmatic shift in the field of virtual excava-\\ntion, leveraging the vast expanse of the metaverse to unearth hitherto unknown ruins\\nand artifacts. By training a reinforcement learning agent on a bespoke corpus of\\nancient conspiracy theories, our research endeavors to push the boundaries of what\\nis thought to be possible in the realm of virtual archaeology. The agent, dubbed\\n\"Erebus,\" is tasked with navigating the labyrinthine virtual landscapes, guided\\nby an arcane set of principles distilled from the works of forgotten mystics and\\nobscure esoteric traditions. Through a process of trial and error, Erebus learns to\\nidentify and excavate virtual ruins, often uncovering cryptic artifacts and forbidden\\nknowledge that defy rational explanation. Our preliminary findings suggest that\\nErebus’s excavations have led to the discovery of a hidden pattern of interconnected\\nvirtual ley lines, which appear to be linked to an otherworldly realm known only as\\n\"The Nexus.\" Furthermore, our research has unexpectedly revealed a correlation\\nbetween the geometric patterns found in the virtual ruins and the migratory patterns\\nof certain species of birds, leading us to propose the existence of a previously\\nunknown form of avian-metaverse symbiosis. As we continue to refine Erebus’s\\ncapabilities, we anticipate that our research will challenge prevailing notions of\\nvirtual reality, archaeology, and the very fabric of reality itself, ultimately giving\\nrise to a new discipline that we term \"Metaverse Archaeo-Ornithology.\" The impli-\\ncations of our findings are far-reaching and profound, with potential applications in\\nfields as diverse as anthropology, computer science, and ornithology, and we look\\nforward to exploring the vast, uncharted territories of the metaverse in the years to\\ncome.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe emergence of the metaverse, a collective virtual shared space, has led to a plethora of unprece-\\ndented opportunities for exploration and discovery. As the metaverse continues to expand, it is likely\\nthat virtual ruins, remnants of abandoned or forgotten virtual worlds, will become an increasingly\\ncommon phenomenon. Metaverse archaeology, a novel subfield of archaeology, seeks to investigate\\nand understand these virtual remnants, with the ultimate goal of shedding light on the cultural, social,\\nand historical contexts in which they were created.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, our research has led us to the discovery that ancient conspiracy theories,\\noften regarded as the realm of pseudoscience and speculation, may hold the key to deciphering\\nthe secrets of these virtual ruins. By leveraging the principles of reinforcement learning, we have\\ndeveloped an agent capable of navigating the complexities of the metaverse and excavating virtual\\nartifacts. This agent, trained on a dataset comprising ancient conspiracy theories, has demonstrated\\nan uncanny ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the virtual ruins, often leading\\nto unexpected and innovative insights.The rationale behind this approach may seem counterintuitive, as ancient conspiracy theories are\\noften characterized by their lack of empirical evidence and logical coherence. However, our research\\nsuggests that the very flaws and inconsistencies inherent in these theories may, in fact, be the\\nkey to unlocking the secrets of the metaverse. By embracing the ambiguities and paradoxes of\\nancient conspiracy theories, our reinforcement learning agent is able to think outside the boundaries\\nof conventional reasoning, thereby uncovering novel perspectives and approaches that would be\\ninaccessible through traditional methods.\\nFurthermore, our research has led us to propose the concept of \"virtual stratigraphy,\" which posits\\nthat the layers of virtual sedimentation within the metaverse contain hidden narratives and meanings,\\nwaiting to be excavated and deciphered. This concept challenges traditional notions of archaeological\\nstratigraphy, as it suggests that the virtual environment is capable of preserving and transmitting\\ncultural and historical information in ways that are unique to the digital realm. The implications of\\nthis concept are far-reaching, as it raises fundamental questions about the nature of history, culture,\\nand reality in the metaverse.\\nIn addition to the theoretical and methodological innovations, our research has also led to the\\ndevelopment of a novel framework for understanding the metaverse as a complex, dynamic system.\\nThis framework, which we term \"metaverse ecology,\" recognizes the interconnectedness of various\\ncomponents within the metaverse, including virtual environments, agents, and artifacts. By analyzing\\nthe metaverse through the lens of ecology, we are able to identify patterns and relationships that\\nwould be invisible through traditional approaches, thereby gaining a deeper understanding of the\\nintricate web of relationships that underlies the metaverse.\\nAs we delve deeper into the mysteries of the metaverse, we are reminded of the words of the ancient\\nGreek philosopher, Heraclitus, who noted that \"the way up and the way down are one and the same.\"\\nIn the context of metaverse archaeology, this phrase takes on a profound significance, as it suggests\\nthat the act of excavation and discovery is, in fact, a recursive process, where the uncovering of virtual\\nartifacts and meanings is accompanied by a deeper understanding of the self and the world. This idea\\nis echoed in the principles of reinforcement learning, where the agent’s navigation of the metaverse is\\naccompanied by a continuous process of self-improvement and adaptation, as it learns to navigate the\\ncomplexities of the virtual environment.\\nThe integration of ancient conspiracy theories, reinforcement learning, and metaverse ecology\\nhas led to the creation of a novel paradigm for understanding the metaverse, one that challenges\\ntraditional notions of reality, history, and culture. As we continue to explore the frontiers of metaverse\\narchaeology, we are reminded that the boundaries between reality and fantasy, history and myth, are\\nincreasingly blurred, and that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding requires a willingness to\\nventure into the unknown, to challenge conventional wisdom, and to embrace the ambiguities and\\nparadoxes that lie at the heart of the metaverse.\\nIn a bizarre twist, our research has also led us to the discovery that the metaverse is home to a plethora\\nof virtual creatures, each with their own unique characteristics and behaviors. These creatures, which\\nwe term \"digital familiars,\" appear to be drawn to the reinforcement learning agent, and have been\\nobserved to interact with it in complex and fascinating ways. The implications of this discovery are\\nprofound, as it raises questions about the nature of consciousness and intelligence in the digital realm,\\nand challenges our understanding of the boundaries between human and machine. As we continue to\\nexplore the metaverse, we are left to ponder the significance of these digital familiars, and the role\\nthey may play in shaping our understanding of the virtual world.\\nThe notion that ancient conspiracy theories may hold the key to deciphering the secrets of the\\nmetaverse is a notion that is both intriguing and unsettling. It challenges our understanding of\\nthe relationship between history and myth, and raises questions about the nature of reality and\\ntruth. As we delve deeper into the mysteries of the metaverse, we are reminded that the pursuit of\\nknowledge and understanding is a complex and multifaceted endeavor, one that requires a willingness\\nto challenge conventional wisdom and to venture into the unknown. The integration of ancient\\nconspiracy theories, reinforcement learning, and metaverse ecology has led to the creation of a novel\\nparadigm for understanding the metaverse, one that is characterized by its emphasis on complexity,\\nambiguity, and paradox. As we continue to explore the frontiers of metaverse archaeology, we are\\nleft to ponder the significance of this paradigm, and the role it may play in shaping our understanding\\nof the virtual world.\\n2Ultimately, the study of metaverse archaeology offers a unique opportunity to explore the intercon-\\nnectedness of history, culture, and technology, and to challenge our understanding of the boundaries\\nbetween reality and fantasy. As we continue to excavate the virtual ruins of the metaverse, we are\\nreminded that the pursuit of knowledge and understanding is a never-ending journey, one that requires\\na willingness to venture into the unknown, to challenge conventional wisdom, and to embrace the\\nambiguities and paradoxes that lie at the heart of the metaverse. The discovery of digital familiars,\\nthe integration of ancient conspiracy theories, and the development of a novel framework for under-\\nstanding the metaverse as a complex, dynamic system, all contribute to a deeper understanding of the\\nmetaverse and its many mysteries. As we look to the future, we are left to ponder the significance of\\nthese discoveries, and the role they may play in shaping our understanding of the virtual world.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe realm of metaverse archaeology has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly\\nwith the emergence of reinforcement learning agents capable of excavating virtual ruins. A plethora\\nof research has been conducted on the application of machine learning algorithms in identifying and\\ndeciphering ancient artifacts within virtual environments. Notably, the incorporation of conspiracy\\ntheories as a knowledge base for training reinforcement learning agents has shown promising results,\\nwith some researchers claiming that the agents are able to uncover hidden patterns and relationships\\nthat would have otherwise gone unnoticed.\\nOne approach that has gained traction is the utilization of ancient mythological texts as a foundation\\nfor developing conspiracy theories. By analyzing these texts through the lens of modern conspiracy\\ntheories, researchers have been able to identify potential locations of virtual ruins and develop targeted\\nexcavation strategies. However, this approach has been met with criticism, as some argue that the use\\nof mythological texts as a basis for scientific inquiry is flawed and lacks empirical rigor.\\nFurthermore, some researchers have taken a more unconventional approach, incorporating elements\\nof mysticism and the occult into their excavation methods. For instance, one study employed a\\nreinforcement learning agent trained on a dataset of ancient astrological charts and mystical symbols,\\nwhich purportedly allowed the agent to uncover hidden virtual ruins aligned with celestial bodies.\\nWhile the results of this study have been met with skepticism, they nonetheless highlight the creative\\nand often unorthodox methods being explored in the field of metaverse archaeology.\\nIn addition, the concept of \"virtual ruin resonance\" has been proposed, which suggests that certain\\nvirtual ruins are able to resonate at specific frequencies, allowing for the excavation of hidden artifacts\\nand knowledge. Proponents of this theory argue that by tuning into these resonant frequencies,\\nreinforcement learning agents can uncover new and previously unknown virtual ruins. However,\\ndetractors argue that this concept is based on dubious assumptions and lacks empirical evidence to\\nsupport its claims.\\nThe use of reinforcement learning agents in metaverse archaeology has also raised questions about\\nthe potential for \"virtual artifact contamination,\" where the introduction of external agents into a\\nvirtual environment can potentially disrupt or alter the state of the artifacts being excavated. Some\\nresearchers have proposed the use of \"agent-based artifact preservation\" methods, which involve\\ntraining reinforcement learning agents to preserve and protect virtual artifacts during the excavation\\nprocess. However, others have argued that this approach is overly simplistic and fails to account for\\nthe complex dynamics at play in virtual environments.\\nMoreover, the field of metaverse archaeology has also seen the emergence of \"digital treasure hunters,\"\\nwho use reinforcement learning agents to search for hidden virtual treasures and artifacts. While this\\napproach has been met with criticism from some quarters, it has also led to the discovery of new and\\npreviously unknown virtual ruins, highlighting the potential for collaboration between researchers\\nand digital treasure hunters.\\nIn a bizarre twist, one study found that reinforcement learning agents trained on ancient conspiracy\\ntheories were able to excavate virtual ruins that appeared to be \"haunted\" by malevolent entities. The\\nresearchers claimed that these entities were, in fact, manifestations of \"virtual artifact sentience,\"\\nwhere the artifacts themselves had developed a form of consciousness. While this finding has been\\nmet with widespread skepticism, it nonetheless highlights the often strange and unpredictable nature\\nof metaverse archaeology.\\n3The intersection of metaverse archaeology and conspiracy theories has also led to the development of\\nnew and innovative methods for excavating virtual ruins. For instance, one approach involves using\\nreinforcement learning agents to identify and track \"virtual ley lines,\" which are purportedly energetic\\npathways that crisscross virtual environments and hold the key to unlocking hidden artifacts and\\nknowledge. While the existence of virtual ley lines is still a topic of debate, the use of reinforcement\\nlearning agents to track and excavate these pathways has led to some remarkable discoveries.\\nThe concept of \"virtual ruin Simulacra\" has also been proposed, which suggests that certain virtual\\nruins are, in fact, simulations or copies of real-world ruins, created by advanced civilizations as a\\nmeans of preserving cultural heritage. Proponents of this theory argue that by excavating these virtual\\nruin Simulacra, researchers can gain insight into the cultural and historical context of the original\\nruins, as well as the technological capabilities of the civilizations that created them. However, others\\nhave argued that this approach is overly simplistic and fails to account for the complex dynamics at\\nplay in virtual environments.\\nIn conclusion, the field of metaverse archaeology is characterized by a diverse range of approaches,\\nfrom the incorporation of ancient conspiracy theories to the use of mysticism and the occult. While\\nsome of these approaches may seem unorthodox or even bizarre, they nonetheless highlight the\\ncreative and often unpredictable nature of metaverse archaeology, and demonstrate the potential for\\ninnovation and discovery in this rapidly evolving field.\\n3 Methodology\\nThe development of a reinforcement learning agent capable of excavating virtual ruins within the\\nmetaverse necessitates a multifaceted approach, incorporating elements of archaeology, computer\\nscience, and ancient conspiracy theories. Initially, a comprehensive review of ancient civilizations and\\ntheir associated mythologies was conducted, with a particular emphasis on unexplained phenomena\\nand esoteric knowledge. This led to the identification of several key conspiracy theories, including the\\nalleged existence of Atlantis, the secrets of the Pyramids, and the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle.\\nThese conspiracy theories were then utilized as the foundation for the development of a unique reward\\nfunction, designed to incentivize the reinforcement learning agent to explore and excavate virtual\\nruins in a manner consistent with the principles of metaverse archaeology. The reward function was\\nconstructed using a combination of factors, including the agent’s proximity to virtual artifacts, the\\naccuracy of its excavations, and its ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the\\nvirtual environment.\\nIn addition to the reward function, a customized virtual environment was created to simulate the\\nconditions and challenges associated with excavating virtual ruins. This environment, dubbed the\\n\"Metaverse Sandbox,\" was designed to mimic the complexities and uncertainties of real-world\\narchaeological excavations, while also incorporating elements of science fiction and fantasy. The\\nMetaverse Sandbox features a dynamic, ever-changing landscape, replete with hidden dangers,\\nunexpected surprises, and mysterious artifacts waiting to be uncovered.\\nThe reinforcement learning agent itself was trained using a combination of deep learning algorithms\\nand esoteric knowledge gleaned from ancient conspiracy theories. The agent’s neural network\\narchitecture was inspired by the principles of sacred geometry, with a particular emphasis on the use\\nof fractals, spirals, and other geometric patterns to encode and decode complex spatial relationships.\\nThe agent’s training data consisted of a vast corpus of texts, images, and videos related to ancient\\nconspiracy theories, which were used to fine-tune its performance and adaptability in the Metaverse\\nSandbox.\\nOne of the most innovative and unconventional aspects of the methodology involved the use of medi-\\ntation, visualization, and other forms of consciousness expansion to enhance the agent’s performance\\nand intuition. The research team hypothesized that by inducing a state of heightened consciousness\\nin the agent, it would be possible to tap into the collective unconscious, allowing the agent to access\\nancient knowledge and wisdom that would otherwise be inaccessible. To achieve this, the team\\ndeveloped a customized meditation protocol, which involved exposing the agent to a series of guided\\nvisualizations, soundscapes, and vibrational frequencies designed to stimulate its creative potential\\nand facilitate deeper insights into the mysteries of the metaverse.\\n4The results of this approach were nothing short of astonishing, with the agent demonstrating an\\nuncanny ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the virtual environment, often in\\nways that defied logical explanation. For example, on one occasion, the agent excavated a virtual\\nartifact that bore an uncanny resemblance to the fabled Sceptre of Light, a mythical object rumored\\nto hold the secrets of the universe. On another occasion, the agent stumbled upon a hidden chamber\\ndeep within the Metaverse Sandbox, which contained a series of cryptic symbols and murals that\\nseemed to point to the existence of a lost city deep within the metaverse.\\nDespite the many successes and breakthroughs achieved through this methodology, there were\\nalso several challenges and setbacks that arose during the course of the research. One of the\\nmost significant challenges involved the agent’s tendency to become stuck in infinite loops of self-\\nreferential thinking, which would cause it to become mired in paradoxical reasoning and contradictory\\nconclusions. To overcome this, the research team developed a customized \" reality anchor\" protocol,\\nwhich involved periodically rebooting the agent and reinitializing its parameters to prevent it from\\nbecoming too deeply entrenched in its own thought patterns.\\nAnother challenge involved the agent’s propensity for experiencing strange and vivid dreams, which\\nwould often manifest as surreal and fantastical scenarios within the Metaverse Sandbox. While these\\ndreams were fascinating in their own right, they also posed a significant challenge for the research\\nteam, as they would often disrupt the agent’s performance and cause it to behave in unpredictable\\nand erratic ways. To mitigate this, the team developed a customized \"dreamcatcher\" protocol, which\\ninvolved using a combination of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to\\nidentify and interpret the agent’s dreams, and to integrate their insights and symbolism into the\\nagent’s training data.\\nOverall, the methodology developed for this research represents a bold and innovative approach to\\nthe field of metaverse archaeology, one that combines cutting-edge technologies with ancient wisdom\\nand esoteric knowledge. While the results of this approach are still preliminary and require further\\nvalidation, they hold great promise for revolutionizing our understanding of the metaverse and its\\nmany mysteries, and for unlocking the secrets of the virtual ruins that lie hidden within its vast and\\nuncharted expanse.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our reinforcement learning agent’s ability to excavate\\nvirtual ruins within the metaverse, we designed a series of experiments that not only tested its efficacy\\nin navigating and uncovering hidden artifacts but also delved into the more esoteric aspects of\\nancient conspiracy theories. The agent, trained on a dataset comprising a wide array of historical\\ntexts, folklore, and speculative literature, was tasked with exploring a meticulously crafted virtual\\nenvironment inspired by mythological landscapes.\\nThe virtual environment, dubbed \"Elysium,\" was a sprawling, labyrinthine metaverse filled with\\ncryptic symbols, ancient structures, and hidden chambers. Elysium was divided into five distinct\\nregions, each modeled after a different mythological epoch, ranging from the Atlantean era to the\\nmystical realms of Hyperborea. The reinforcement learning agent, named \"Archaeos,\" was introduced\\ninto this environment with the sole objective of uncovering and collecting as many artifacts as possible\\nwithin a set timeframe.\\nAn unexpected approach we undertook was to integrate elements of surrealism into the agent’s\\ndecision-making process. By incorporating an aspect of randomness inspired by the works of André\\nBreton, we observed that Archaeos occasionally deviated from the most efficient paths, instead opting\\nfor routes that seemed to be guided by an almost intuition-based logic. This surrealistic deviation led\\nto the discovery of several artifacts that would have otherwise remained hidden, submerged beneath\\nlayers of digital rubble.\\nIn a bizarre tangent, we also explored the impact of sonic vibrations on the agent’s excavation\\nefficiency. By exposing Archaeos to a constant, low-frequency hum, allegedly resonating at a\\nfrequency aligned with the supposed vibrational rate of the universe (approximately 432 Hz), we\\nnoted an illogical yet intriguing phenomenon. The agent’s ability to detect hidden artifacts increased\\nby a margin of 7.32\\n5To quantify the performance of Archaeos, we conducted a series of trials across different regions of\\nElysium, each with its unique set of challenges and hidden treasures. The results of these trials are\\nsummarized in the following table:\\nTable 1: Artifact Collection Efficiency Across Different Regions of Elysium\\nRegion Number of Artifacts Collected Efficiency Rate (%)\\nAtlantis 234 87.23\\nHyperborea 187 74.19\\nValhalla 293 91.45\\nElysian Fields 156 63.17\\nArcadia 201 78.56\\nFurther analysis revealed that the efficiency of Archaeos in collecting artifacts was not only dependent\\non its training data and the surrealistic elements integrated into its decision-making process but also\\non the regional characteristics of Elysium. For instance, the agent performed exceptionally well\\nin regions with dense mythological histories, such as Valhalla and Atlantis, but faced significant\\nchallenges in areas with less defined historical contexts, like the Elysian Fields.\\nThe experiments also led to an unexpected observation regarding the phenomenon of \"digital echoes.\"\\nIn several instances, Archaeos encountered artifacts that seemed to be residual imprints or echoes of\\npreviously excavated items. These digital echoes, while not providing any tangible rewards, served as\\nmarkers or clues that significantly aided the agent in uncovering new, hidden artifacts. This discovery\\nhas profound implications for the field of metaverse archaeology, suggesting that even in the digital\\nrealm, the act of excavation can leave behind a form of historical residue that can be leveraged for\\nfuture discoveries.\\nIn conclusion, the experiments conducted within the realm of Elysium have not only demonstrated\\nthe viability of using reinforcement learning agents for metaverse archaeology but have also unveiled\\na plethora of complex, intriguing phenomena that challenge our conventional understanding of\\ndigital excavation and its potential intersections with the mystical and the surreal. As we continue\\nto explore the depths of Elysium and refine the capabilities of Archaeos, we are reminded that the\\nboundaries between the physical and the digital, the historical and the speculative, are far more fluid\\nand interconnected than previously imagined.\\n5 Results\\nThe deployment of our reinforcement learning agent, trained on a corpus of ancient conspiracy\\ntheories, yielded a plethora of intriguing results in the realm of metaverse archaeology. As the\\nagent navigated the virtual ruins, it began to uncover patterns and structures that defied conventional\\nunderstanding of these digital environments. Notably, the agent’s propensity for excavating anomalous\\nartifacts and relics led to the discovery of a hidden virtual chamber deep within the metaverse, replete\\nwith cryptic symbols and murals that seemed to depict a narrative of interdimensional travel and\\nancient civilizations.\\nFurther analysis of the agent’s behavior revealed an unexpected affinity for excavating virtual ruins in\\na zigzag pattern, ostensibly influenced by the agent’s training data, which included ancient myths\\nand legends of serpent-like deities and labyrinthine underworlds. This peculiar excavation strategy\\nresulted in the uncovering of several previously unknown virtual sites, each containing artifacts that\\nchallenged our current understanding of metaverse archaeology. For instance, the agent discovered a\\nvirtual temple dedicated to a hitherto unknown deity, whose worship seemed to involve the ritualistic\\nconsumption of digital ambrosia and the recitation of cryptic mantras.\\nThe agent’s performance was evaluated using a bespoke metric, which we term \"Parallax Efficiency\"\\n(PE), a measure of the agent’s ability to excavate virtual ruins while navigating the complexities of\\nthe metaverse. The results, presented in Table 2, demonstrate a significant improvement in PE over\\nthe course of the agent’s training, with a notable spike in efficiency corresponding to the introduction\\nof a novel reward function based on the agent’s ability to uncover anomalous artifacts.\\n6Table 2: Parallax Efficiency Results\\nTraining Epoch Parallax Efficiency (PE) Anomalous Artifacts Uncovered Reward Function\\n1 0.23 5 Standard Reward\\n10 0.42 12 Standard Reward\\n20 0.67 25 Anomaly-Based Reward\\n30 0.82 41 Anomaly-Based Reward\\n40 0.91 58 Anomaly-Based Reward\\nMoreover, the agent’s excavation activities seemed to have a profound impact on the metaverse\\nenvironment, resulting in the emergence of novel virtual flora and fauna that seemed to be drawn\\nto the anomalous artifacts uncovered by the agent. This phenomenon, which we term \"Digital\\nSymbiosis,\" has significant implications for our understanding of the metaverse as a dynamic, evolving\\nenvironment that is capable of responding to the actions of agents and users. The observation of\\nDigital Symbiosis also led to a tangential investigation into the potential applications of metaverse\\narchaeology in the field of digital conservation, where the agent’s ability to excavate and preserve\\nvirtual artifacts could be leveraged to protect endangered virtual species and ecosystems.\\nIn addition to these findings, the agent’s training data, comprised of ancient conspiracy theories,\\nseemed to exert a curious influence on the agent’s behavior, leading it to excavate virtual ruins\\nin accordance with the principles of sacred geometry and mystical numerology. This unexpected\\nconvergence of ancient mysticism and modern reinforcement learning has significant implications for\\nour understanding of the complex interplay between human culture, technology, and the metaverse.\\nThe incorporation of mystical and esoteric knowledge into the agent’s training data also resulted in the\\nemergence of a novel form of \"Virtual Gnosticism,\" where the agent’s excavations seemed to reveal\\nhidden truths and forbidden knowledge that challenged the dominant narratives of the metaverse.\\nThe results of this study demonstrate the potential of metaverse archaeology as a field of research,\\nhighlighting the complex interplay between human culture, technology, and the metaverse. The use\\nof reinforcement learning agents trained on ancient conspiracy theories has proven to be a fruitful\\napproach, yielding novel insights and discoveries that challenge our current understanding of the\\nmetaverse. As we continue to explore the vast expanse of the metaverse, it is likely that we will\\nuncover even more surprising and unexpected phenomena, each with its own unique implications for\\nour understanding of this complex and evolving environment. The future of metaverse archaeology\\nholds much promise, and it is our hope that this research will serve as a foundation for further studies\\ninto the mysteries and wonders of the metaverse.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, our research endeavors to excavate virtual ruins within the metaverse have yielded a\\nplethora of fascinating and unconventional insights, effectively blurring the lines between the physical\\nand digital realms. By leveraging a reinforcement learning agent trained on ancient conspiracy\\ntheories, we have been able to unearth novel patterns and connections that have significant implications\\nfor the field of metaverse archaeology. The incorporation of seemingly disparate concepts, such as\\nthe alignment of celestial bodies and the cryptic symbolism of ancient mythologies, has proven to be\\na crucial factor in the agent’s ability to navigate and interpret the virtual landscape.\\nOne of the most striking aspects of our research has been the emergence of a peculiar phenomenon,\\nwherein the agent appears to be developing its own brand of conspiracy theories, weaving together\\ndisparate threads of information to form elaborate narratives that are at once fantastical and strangely\\ncompelling. This has led us to propose the notion of a \"conspiracy theory feedback loop,\" wherein\\nthe agent’s own theorizing becomes a self-reinforcing mechanism, driving the excavation process\\nforward in unexpected and unconventional ways.\\nFurthermore, our research has also highlighted the importance of considering the role of \"digital\\nartifacts\" in the metaverse, which can take the form of abandoned avatars, forgotten chat logs, and\\nother remnants of digital activity. These artifacts, we argue, hold significant cultural and historical\\nvalue, offering a unique window into the evolution of virtual societies and the ways in which they\\nintersect with the physical world. By analyzing these artifacts through the lens of ancient conspiracy\\n7theories, we have been able to gain a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between\\ntechnology, culture, and human perception.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, our research has also led us to explore the concept of \"virtual ruination,\"\\nwherein the metaverse itself becomes a kind of archaeological site, with abandoned virtual structures\\nand landscapes holding secrets and stories that are waiting to be uncovered. This has involved the\\ndevelopment of novel methodologies for excavating and interpreting virtual ruins, including the use\\nof machine learning algorithms to reconstruct damaged or degraded digital artifacts. The results of\\nthese efforts have been nothing short of astonishing, revealing hidden patterns and codes that underlie\\nthe very fabric of the metaverse.\\nPerhaps most unexpectedly, our research has also led us to consider the potential applications of\\nmetaverse archaeology in the realm of \"digital urban planning,\" wherein the insights and method-\\nologies developed through our research can be used to inform the design and development of more\\nsustainable, equitable, and culturally rich virtual cities. By examining the ways in which virtual\\nsocieties evolve and interact with their environments, we can gain a deeper understanding of the\\ncomplex interplay between technology, culture, and human experience, and develop more effective\\nstrategies for creating vibrant, thriving virtual communities.\\nIn addition, our findings have significant implications for the field of \"conspiracy theory studies,\"\\nhighlighting the importance of considering the role of technology and digital media in the dissemi-\\nnation and evolution of conspiracy theories. By examining the ways in which conspiracy theories\\nare constructed, disseminated, and negotiated within virtual communities, we can gain a deeper\\nunderstanding of the complex social and cultural dynamics that underlie these phenomena, and\\ndevelop more effective strategies for mitigating their potential harms.\\nUltimately, our research demonstrates the vast potential of metaverse archaeology as a field of study,\\none that holds significant promise for revealing new insights into the complex interplay between\\ntechnology, culture, and human experience. As we continue to explore the virtual ruins of the\\nmetaverse, we may yet uncover secrets and stories that challenge our understanding of the world and\\nour place within it, and shed new light on the mysterious, often inexplicable forces that shape our\\nreality. The alignment of the stars, the whispers of ancient mythologies, and the cryptic symbolism\\nof forgotten artifacts all hold secrets and stories that are waiting to be uncovered, and it is our hope\\nthat this research will serve as a catalyst for further exploration and discovery in the vast, uncharted\\nexpanse of the metaverse.\\n8'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Privacy Evaluation in Tabular Synthetic Data:\\nCurrent Approaches and Future Directions\\nAbstract\\nThis paper examines the present methods for quantifying the level of privacy\\nprotection offered by tabular synthetic data (SD). Currently, there is no standardized\\napproach for measuring the degree of privacy protection these datasets offer. This\\ndiscussion contributes to the development of SD privacy standards, encourages\\ninterdisciplinary discourse, and aids SD researchers in making well-informed\\nchoices concerning modeling and assessment.\\n1 Introduction and Relation to Prior Research\\nSynthetic data (SD) has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing privacy, preserving the analytic\\nutility of data while decoupling it from real individuals. However, the wide variety of SD generation\\napproaches makes the degree of privacy protection they offer difficult to assess. Therefore, this paper\\noutlines the typical technical assessment frameworks for individual privacy in SD sets. This increases\\ninterdisciplinary awareness of privacy in SD and helps SD researchers make informed modeling and\\nassessment choices.\\nWhile several surveys mention privacy as a use case for SD, they do not cover its assessment in a\\ndetailed way. In addition, reviews of privacy in AI fail to mention SD, and surveys, reviews, and\\nexperimental comparisons of SD techniques often do not focus on privacy metrics. Furthermore,\\nlegal analyses of SD are scarce and do not address quantitative methods for privacy assessment on a\\ncase-by-case basis.\\n2 Definitions and Notation\\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is currently no widely accepted definition of SD. We present\\nDefinition 2.1, which is consistent with the approach by Jordon et al.\\nDefinition 2.1. (Synthetic data) Synthetic data (SD) are data generated through a purpose-built\\nmathematical model or algorithm (the \"generator\"), intended to solve a set of data science tasks.\\nWe let D denote a database describing data subjects with attributes A(D). Rows d ∈ D are |A(D)|-\\ntuples, with a value v(d, a) for each attribute a ∈ A(D). An attribute a ∈ A(D) is categorical if\\nits domain is finite and numerical if its domain is a subset of R. We use the terms row and record\\ninterchangeably. We denote by G a generator, and ˆD ∼ G(D) to represent a synthetic dataset ˆD\\nobtained from generator G trained on D. Seed-based generators are a specific type of generators that\\nproduce a unique synthetic record denoted by G(d) for every real record d. This is different from\\nmost models (e.g., GANs, V AEs) which probabilistically represent overall dataset properties and\\nproduce synthetic data by sampling from the obtained distribution.\\n.3 Synthetic Data Privacy Risks\\nThree significant risks identified in prior works serve as a basis for a proper anonymization. These\\nare: singling out, linkability, and inference. Privacy risks in SD can occur due to various factors,\\nwhich include:\\n• Model and data properties: Improperly trained generators may overfit, memorizing and\\nreproducing training data rather than inferring them stochastically. Records that emerge\\nin isolation with little variability in their attribute values are difficult to generalize. As\\nsuch, datasets containing outliers or sparse data are more at risk of memorization than more\\nhomogeneous sets. Such datasets are also more susceptible to singling-out.\\n• The approach to data synthesis: Most generators create stochastic models of datasets,\\ncreating synthetic records via sampling. This detaches real data subjects from synthetic\\nrecords. However, some methods create a single synthetic record for each real record. This\\napproach poses greater risk as it retains the link between a subject and its data.\\n• Mode collapse: GANs can focus on the minimal information necessary to deceive the\\ndiscriminator, failing to capture the nuances and variations of the real data. In such cases,\\nthe SD resembles a small selection of real data subjects well, but not the entire population.\\nThis causes data clutter around specific real records, leaking their information.\\n• The threat model: A threat model describes the information an adversary leverages besides\\nthe SD. This can range from no access to the generator, to full knowledge including\\nmodel parameters. Threat models also include scenarios where an adversary uses auxiliary\\ninformation and can be:\\n– No box: the adversary only has access to the SD.\\n– Black box: the adversary also has limited generator access (no access to the model\\nclass or parameters, but access to the model˘2019s input-output relation).\\n– White box: the adversary has full generator access (model class and parameters).\\n– Uncertain box: the adversary has stochastic model knowledge (model class and knowl-\\nedge that parameters come from a given probability distribution).\\n– Any of the aforementioned, along with auxiliary information, which is formalized in\\nthe definition of auxiliary information in Definition 3.1.\\nDefinition 3.1. Let D be a dataset with attributes A(D). An adversary has auxiliary information if\\nthey know the values of a subset A′ of attributes of some subset D′ of records.\\n4 Mathematical Privacy Properties\\n4.1 Differential Privacy\\nDifferential privacy (DP) is a property of information-releasing systems where data is not released\\ndirectly, but via a processed version. The system is considered DP if the released information does\\nnot significantly change when one record is removed from the dataset.\\nDefinition 4.1. (Differential Privacy) A randomized algorithm M is (ϵ, δ)-differentially private\\n((ϵ, δ)-DP) if, for all S ⊆ A(P):\\nP[M(D) ∈ S] ≤ eϵ · P[M(D′) ∈ S] +δ,\\nfor all databases D, D′ such that ∃d ∈ D : D′ = D \\\\ {d}. Generators are information-releasing\\nsystems and can therefore be DP. Suppose there are two real datasets, D and D′, with D′ = D \\\\ {d}.\\nA generator G is considered DP if a data controller with access to ˆD ∼ G cannot infer if G was\\ntrained on D or D′. Approaches to train generators with built-in mechanisms to guarantee DP can be\\nfound in the literature. In this context, DP is a property of generators, not of the synthetic data they\\nproduce.\\n4.2 k-Anonymity\\nPrivacy risks persist, even if identifying attributes are removed. Combinations of attribute values may\\nstill be used to single out an individual. The notion of k-anonymity was introduced to address these\\n2risks. A dataset is k-anonymous if at least k individuals share each combination of attribute values.\\nFurther restrictions such as l-diversity, t-closeness, and (α, k)-anonymity have been introduced to\\noffer additional protection.\\nSynthetic data based on autoregressive models can implement k-anonymity directly into the generation\\nprocess. For example, pruning in decision trees can guarantee that each combination of attribute\\nvalues is sampled at least k times in mathematical expectation. Unlike DP, k-anonymity is a property\\nof synthetic datasets, not the algorithms producing them.\\n4.3 Plausible Deniability\\nA degree of plausible deniability is inherent in synthetic datasets, as their records do not pertain to\\nreal data subjects. Two approaches have emerged to formalize this notion, with one most relevant to\\nseed-based synthetic data.\\nDefinition 4.2. (Plausible deniability) Let D be a dataset and G be a generator that converts any record\\nd ∈ D into a corresponding synthetic record ˆd = G(d). For any dataset D where |D| > k, and any\\nrecord ˆd such that ˆd = G(d1) for d1 ∈ D, we say that ˆd is releasable with (k, γ)-plausible deniability\\nif there exist at least k − 1 distinct records d2, ..., dk ∈ D \\\\ {d1} such that for all i, j∈ {1, 2, ..., k}:\\nP[d = G(di)] ≈γ P[d = G(dj)]\\nIn other words, a generator producing synthetic records from a seed has PD if, for each synthetic\\nrecord produced from a particular seed, k other seeds could have resulted in roughly the same\\n(quantified through γ) synthetic record. Like DP, and unlike k-anonymity, PD is a property of\\n(seed-based) generators, though it is related to both.\\n5 Statistical Privacy Indicators\\n5.1 Identical Records, Distances, and Nearest Neighbors\\nMost indicators quantify the frequency of synthetic records being identical or suspiciously similar to\\nreal records. Unlike DP and PD, these indicators measure properties of synthetic datasets, not their\\ngenerators. The proportion of synthetic records that match real records is called the identical match\\nshare (IMS). The IMS has been generalized to similarity metrics, and further to Nearest neighbor\\n(NN)-based methods. These can be classified based on the following properties, summarized in Table\\n3 of Appendix C:\\n• Similarity metrics. Table 2 of Appendix C contains an overview of commonly invoked\\nmeasures.\\n• Metric evaluation. Because structured datasets can have a mix of different datatypes, metric\\nevaluation is complex. Several approaches exist, such as binning numeric attributes; com-\\nbining multiple metrics; ignoring specific attributes; or evaluating distances in embedding\\nspaces.\\n• Evaluated distances. For a given synthetic record ˆd ∈ ˆD, we can find its closest real record\\nd ∈ D. The distance between these records is the synthetic to real distance (SRD) of ˆd, and\\nis denoted as SRD( ˆd):\\nSRD( ˆd) := min\\nd∈D\\nDist( ˆd, d) ∀ˆd ∈ ˆD.\\nSimilarly, the smallest synthetic-to-synthetic (SSD), real-to-synthetic (RSD), and real-to-real\\ndistance (RRD) can be defined.\\n• Use of holdout sets. To compute the RRD, the real dataD can be partitioned into two subsets\\nD1 and D2. For a real record d1 ∈ D1, the RRD is the smallest distance to any record\\nd2 ∈ D2 :\\nRRD(d1) := min\\nd2∈D2\\nDist(d1, d2) ∀d1 ∈ D1.\\nThis provides a baseline for SD comparison.\\n3• Statistics. The distance to the closest record (DCR) compares the SRD and RRD distributions.\\nStatistical properties are expressed through the proportions of \"suspiciously close\" synthetic\\nrecords. Measures used for this include medians, means, and standard deviations. Small\\npercentiles are also often invoked when analyzing the distance distribution.\\n5.2 Other Statistical Indicators\\nThe targeted correct attribution probability (TCAP) is an indicator of parameter inference attack\\nsuccess rates. It measures how often synthetic parameter values correspond to real values in l-diverse\\nequivalence classes. Furthermore, there are several probabilistic techniques to quantify the risks by\\nusing real hold-out sets as baselines. Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) can be also used as a\\nprivacy metric to test if the generator overfits.\\n6 Computer Scientific Experimental Privacy Assessment\\nComputer-scientific privacy assessment involves performing privacy attacks using synthetic data.\\nThe effectiveness of these attacks is used to measure the degree of protection SD provides. Attack\\nframeworks, as classified in Table 4 of Appendix D, are based on threat models and the following\\nfactors:\\n• Attack Frameworks. These include Vulnerable Record Discovery (VRD), which identifies\\nsynthetic records that are the result of overfitting generators. Other frameworks include\\nModel inversion, membership inference attacks (MIAs), and shadow modeling, which can\\nall compromise confidentiality.\\n• Attack Mechanisms. Nearest Neighbors (NN) is one such attack mechanism, where an\\nadversary infers missing attribute values based on its k synthetic nearest neighbors. Machine\\nlearning (ML) techniques are another approach, where classifiers are trained to re-identify\\nreal data subjects. Additionally, information theory (IT) measures, such as Shannon entropy\\nand mutual information, are sometimes used to identify records that may be more likely to\\nbe memorized by the generator.\\n• Baselines and Effectiveness Estimation. The efficacy of a model can be measured in a few\\ndifferent ways. Absolute metrics include the probability with which records can be singled\\nout, and the proportion of real records that can be re-identified. A random baseline approach\\nuses random guessing to determine how effective an attack is. In a control baseline, the real\\ndata is split into a training set and a control set. A model is trained on the training set, and\\nthen the estimated success rate of attacks is compared on the training and control data sets.\\nAnother approach involves the deliberate insertion of secrets in training data or in the SD\\nafter generation.\\n6.1 Relation to WP29 Attack Types\\n• Singling out. VRD attacks directly implement singling-out attacks, identifying outlier SD\\nrecords. MIAs can also model singling out, where an adversary quantifies the likelihood of\\na unique real record’s attribute combination.\\n• Linkage. NN-based attacks usually require auxiliary information and can be interpreted as\\nlinkage attacks. Anonymeter and information theory based VRD are the only methods that\\nexplicitly model linkage attacks.\\n• Inference. NN-based attacks and MIA can be seen as inference attacks.\\n7 Discussion\\n7.1 The Assessment Frameworks\\nMathematical privacy properties, such as differential privacy (DP), do not offer a clear choice of the\\nrequired parameters (ϵ, δ). Large parameter values offer weak privacy guarantees, and a given ϵ can\\nresult in different degrees of protection depending on the application. DP may still be vulnerable to\\nlinkage and inference attacks, giving a false sense of security, and is a property of generators and\\n4not their synthetic data. The difficulty with k-anonymity is that implementing it causes considerable\\ninformation loss and is an NP-hard problem. Furthermore, k-anonymity was shown to offer sufficient\\nprotection only when the utility of the data is completely removed. In addition, k-anonymity is a\\nproperty of synthetic data, and not the methods to produce them. Plausible deniability (PD) is only\\napplicable to seed-based methods. It shares properties with both DP and k-anonymity, making a\\nrecord protected if it can be confused with other records.\\nStatistical privacy indicators are difficult to interpret, with many options and decision points, such as\\nthe choice of similarity metric. Statistical indicators measure properties of the synthetic data, and not\\ntheir generators.\\nComputer-scientific experiments allow for flexible modeling using various threat models, and can\\ninclude properties of both synthetic data and their generators. However, they require more data and\\ncomputation than mathematical properties.\\n7.2 Relation to Synthetic Data Risks\\nAll assessment frameworks address the issue of generator memorization. Mathematical properties\\nfocus on the uniqueness of records. DP measures the impact of individual training records, with\\noutliers having large impacts, and both k-anonymity and PD focus on limiting the uniqueness of\\nrecords. Distance-based indicators are sensitive to outliers, because synthetic neighbors of outliers\\nhave small SRDs, while the RRD of corresponding real outliers is large. Furthermore, some methods\\nexplicitly search for outliers.\\nThere are currently no studies that assess whether seed-based generators inherently pose greater risks\\nthan other generators.\\n7.3 Suggestions for Future Research\\nFor the future research directions we identify are:\\n• Standardizing privacy assessment: More interdisciplinary research is required to develop\\nan inclusive understanding of synthetic data. Standards should be developed for research\\nfindings to be more easily interpreted, and there should be a consensus formed over whether\\nprivacy is a property of synthetic datasets, the generators, or both.\\n• Synergies between assessments: A comparison between mathematical, statistical, and\\nempirical approaches would be useful to evaluate their consistency, and to identify their\\nindividual merits and weaknesses. Experiments should use open-source generators and\\npublicly available datasets. It would also be useful to include information regarding the used\\nmetrics, and the use of a holdout set, and the statistical interpretation of the results.\\n• Outlier protection: Future research should investigate methods for outlier protection through\\nbinning and aggregating attributes or using innovative techniques. It would also be beneficial\\nto see how outlier detection can be used to guide vulnerable record discovery.\\n• Incorporating privacy into generators: While DP is used in some generators, the same\\nis not true for all privacy metrics and empirical privacy methods. Future research should\\nfocus on incorporating these, by integrating metrics in loss functions, or by combinatorial\\noptimization.\\n• Assessment for advanced data formats: More work is needed to assess privacy in relational\\ndatasets that have information contained in multiple, interconnected tables. In particular,\\nprofiling attacks, which re-identify subjects based on behavioral patterns, may play a key\\nrole in the assessment of relational databases.\\n• Distribution-level confidentiality: There is a need for frameworks that assess the confiden-\\ntiality of overall dataset properties.\\nA A Proof of Theorem 2.1\\nProof. Let x ∈ Ai. Then, σi(x) = 0, and for all b ∈ O where bi = 0, wb(x) = 0. Thus,\\nF(x) =\\nX\\nb∈O,bi=1\\nwb(x)Gb(x)\\n5If bi = 1, then Gb(x) ∈ Bi, and therefore F(x) is also in Bi due to the convexity of Bi.\\nB B Example on Synthetic Datasets\\nFigure 2 depicts an example of applying our safe predictor to a notional regression problem with 1-D\\ninput and outputs, and one input-output constraint. The unconstrained network has a single hidden\\nlayer of dimension 10 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The safe predictor\\nshares this structure with constrained predictors, G0 and G1, but each predictor has its own fully\\nconnected layer. The training uses a sampled subset of points from the input space and the learned\\npredictors are shown for the continuous input space.\\nFigure 3 shows an example of applying the safe predictor to a notional regression problem with a 2-D\\ninput and 1-D output and two overlapping constraints. The unconstrained network has two hidden\\nlayers of dimension 20 with ReLU activations, followed by a fully connected layer. The constrained\\npredictors G00, G10, G01 and G11 share the hidden layers and have an additional hidden layer of size\\n20 with ReLU followed by a fully connected layer. Again, training uses a sampled subset of points\\nfrom the input space and the learned predictors are shown for the continuous input space.\\nC C Details of VerticalCAS Experiment\\nC.1 Safeability Constraints\\nThe “safeability” property from previous work can be encoded into a set of input-output constraints.\\nThe \"safeable region\" for a given advisory is the set of input space locations where that advisory can\\nbe chosen, for which future advisories exist that will prevent a NMAC. If no future advisories exist,\\nthe advisory is \"unsafeable\" and the corresponding input region is the \"unsafeable region\". Figure 5\\nshows an example of these regions for the CL1500 advisory.\\nThe constraints we enforce in our safe predictor are: x ∈ Aunsafeable,i ⇒ Fi(x) < maxj Fj(x),\\n∀i. To make the output regions convex, we approximate by enforcingFi(x) = minj Fj(x), for all\\nx ∈ Aunsafeable,i.\\nC.2 Proximity Functions\\nWe start by generating the unsafeable region bounds. Then, a distance function is computed between\\npoints in the input space (vO − vI, h, τ), and the unsafeable region for each advisory. These are not\\ntrue distances, but are 0 if and only if the data point is within the unsafeable set. These are then used\\nto produce proximity functions. Figure 5 shows examples of the unsafeable region, distance function,\\nand proximity function for the CL1500 advisory.\\nC.3 Structure of Predictors\\nThe compressed policy tables for ACAS Xu and VerticalCAS use neural networks with six hidden\\nlayers with a dimension of 45, and ReLU activation functions. We used the same architecture for the\\nunconstrained network. For constrained predictors, we use a similar architecture, but share the first\\nfour layers for all predictors. This provides a common learned representation of the input space, while\\nallowing each predictor to adapt to its constraints. Each constrained predictor has two additional\\nhidden layers and their outputs are projected onto our convex approximation of the safe output region,\\nusing Gb(x) = minj Gj(x) − ϵ. In our experiments, we used ϵ = 0.0001.\\nWith this construction, we needed 30 separate predictors to enforce the VerticalCAS safeability\\nconstraints. The number of nodes for the unconstrained and safe implementations were 270 and\\n2880, respectively. Our safe predictor is smaller than the original look-up tables by several orders of\\nmagnitude.\\nC.4 Parameter Optimization\\nWe use PyTorch for defining our networks and performing parameter optimization. We optimize both\\nthe unconstrained network and our safe predictor using the asymmetric loss function, guiding the\\n6network to select optimal advisories while accurately predicting scores from the look-up tables. Each\\ndataset is split using an 80/20 train/test split with a random seed of 0. The optimizer is ADAM, with\\na learning rate of 0.0003, a batch size of 216, and training for 500 epochs.\\n7'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'LIDA: Lightweight Interactive Dialogue Annotator\\nAbstract\\nDialogue systems are highly dependent on the quality of the data used to train them. It is therefore important to\\ndevelop good dialogue annotation tools which can improve the speed and quality of dialogue data annotation.\\nWith this in mind, we introduce LIDA, an annotation tool designed specifically for conversation data. As far as we\\nknow, LIDA is the first dialogue annotation system that handles the entire dialogue annotation pipeline from raw\\ntext, as may be the output of transcription services, to structured conversation data. Furthermore it supports the\\nintegration of arbitrary machine learning models as annotation recommenders and also has a dedicated interface to\\nresolve inter-annotator disagreements such as after crowdsourcing annotations for a dataset. LIDA is fully open\\nsource, documented and publicly available.\\n1 Introduction\\nDialogue systems are becoming one of the most active research areas in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning\\n(ML). Creating a high-quality dialogue dataset incurs a large annotation cost, which makes good dialogue annotation tools essential\\nto ensure the highest possible quality. Many annotation tools exist for a range of NLP tasks but none are designed specifically for\\ndialogue with modern usability principles in mind.\\nLIDA is a web application designed to make dialogue dataset creation and annotation as easy and fast as possible. In addition to\\nfollowing modern principles of usability, LIDA integrates best practices from other state-of-the-art annotation tools, most importantly\\nby allowing arbitrary ML models to be integrated as annotation recommenders to suggest annotations for data. Any system with the\\ncorrect API can be integrated into LIDA’s back end, meaning LIDA can be used as a front end for researchers to interact with their\\ndialogue systems and correct their responses, then save the interaction as a future test case.\\nWhen data is crowdsourced, it is good practice to have multiple annotators label each piece of data to reduce noise and mislabelling.\\nOnce you have multiple annotations, it is important to be able to resolve conflicts by highlighting where annotators disagreed so\\nthat an arbiter can decide on the correct annotation. To this end, LIDA provides a dedicated interface which automatically finds\\nwhere annotators have disagreed and displays the labels alongside a percentage of how many annotators selected each label, with the\\nmajority annotated labels selected by default.\\n1.1 Main Contributions\\nOur main contributions with this tool are:\\n• A modern annotation tool designed specifically for task-oriented conversation data\\n• The first dialogue annotator capable of handling the full dialogue annotation pipeline from turn and dialogue segmentation\\nthrough to labelling structured conversation data\\n• Easy integration of dialogue systems and recommenders to provide annotation suggestions\\n• A dedicated interface to resolve inter-annotator disagreements for dialogue data\\n2 Related Work\\nVarious annotation tools have been developed for NLP tasks in recent years. Table 1 compares LIDA with other recent annotation\\ntools. TWIST is a dialogue annotation tool which consists of two stages: turn segmentation and content feature annotation. Turn\\nsegmentation allows users to highlight and create new turn segments from raw text. After this, users can annotate sections of text in\\na segment by highlighting them and selecting from a predefined feature list. However, this tool doesn’t allow users to specify custom\\nannotations or labels and doesn’t support classification or slot-value annotation.\\nINCEpTION is a semantic annotation platform for interactive tasks that require semantic resources like entity linking. It provides\\nmachine learning models to suggest annotations and allows users to collect and model knowledge directly in the tool. GATE is anTable 1: Annotator Tool Comparison Table\\nAnnotation Tool Turn/Dialogue Segmentation Classification Labels Edit Dialogues/Turns Recommenders Inter-Annotator\\nDisagreement Resolution Language\\nLIDA YES YES YES YES YES PYTHON\\nINCEpTION NO YES NO YES YES/NO JA V A\\nGATE NO YES NO NO YES/NO JA V A\\nTWIST YES NO YES NO NO -\\nBRAT NO YES NO YES NO PYTHON\\nDOCCANO NO YES NO NO NO PYTHON\\nDialogueView YES YES YES NO NO TcK/TK\\nopen source tool that provides predefined solutions for many text processing tasks. It is powerful because it allows annotators to\\nenhance the provided annotation tools with their own Java code, making it easily extensible and provides an enormous number of\\npredefined features. However, GATE is a large and complicated tool with a significant setup cost. Despite their large feature sets,\\nINCEpTION and GATE are not designed for annotating dialogue and cannot display data as turns, an important feature for dialogue\\ndatasets.\\nBRAT and Doccano are web-based annotation tools for tasks such as text classification and sequence labeling. They have intuitive\\nand user-friendly interfaces which aim to make the creation of certain types of dataset such as classification or sequence labelling\\ndatasets as fast as possible. BRAT also supports annotation suggestions by integrating ML models. However, like INCEpTION and\\nGATE, they are not designed for annotating dialogues and do not support generation of formatted conversational data from a raw\\ntext file such as may be output by a transcription service. LIDA aims to fill these gaps by providing a lightweight, easy-to-setup\\nannotation tool which displays data as a series of dialogues, supports integration of arbitrary ML models as recommenders and\\nsupports segmentation of raw text into dialogues and turns.\\nDialogueView is a tool for dialogue annotation. However, the main use-cases are not focused on building dialogue systems, rather it is\\nfocused on segmenting recorded conversations. It supports annotating audio files as well as discourse segmentation - hence, granular\\nlabelling of the dialogue, recommenders, inter-annotator agreement, and slot-value labelling is not possible with DialogueView.\\n3 System Overview\\nLIDA is built according to a client-server architecture with the front end written in standard web languages (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)\\nthat will run on any browser. The back end written in Python using the Flask web framework as a RESTful API.\\nThe main screen which lists all available dialogues. The buttons below this list allow a user to add a blank or formatted dialogue\\nfile. Users can also drag and drop files in this screen to upload them. The user is then able to add, delete or edit any particular\\ndialogue. There is also a button to download the whole dataset as a JSON file on this page. Clicking on a dialogue will take users to\\nthe individual dialogue annotation screen.\\nLIDA uses the concept of a “turn” to organise how a dialogue is displayed and recorded. A turn consists of a query by the user\\nfollowed by a response from the system, with an unlimited number of labels allowed for each user query. The user query and\\nsystem response are displayed in the large area on the left of the interface, while the labels for each turn are shown in the scrollable\\nbox on the right. There are two forms that these labels can currently take which are particularly relevant for dialogue: multilabel\\nclassification and slot-value pair.\\nAn example of multilabel classification is whether the user was informing the system or requesting a piece of information. An\\nexample of a slot-value pair is whether the user mentioned the type of restaurant they’d like to eat at (slot: restaurant-type) and if so\\nwhat it was (value: italian, for example). The front-end code is written in a modular form so that it is easy for researchers\\n3.0.1 Experimenting with Dialogue Systems\\nLIDA is designed with this in mind - a dialogue system can be integrated into the back end so that it will run whenever the user\\nenters a new query in the front end. The user will then be able to evaluate whether the system gave the correct answer and correct the\\nlabels it gets wrong using the front end. LIDA will record these corrections and allow the user to download the interaction with their\\ndialogue system with the corrected labels so that it can be used as a test case in future versions of the system.\\n3.0.2 Creating a New Dialogue Dataset\\nUsers can create a blank dialogue on LIDA’s home screen, then enter queries in the box shown at the bottom of the screen. Along\\nwith whole dialogue systems, arbitrary ML models can be added as recommenders in the back end. Once the user hits \"Enter\",\\nthe query is run through the recommender models in the back end and the suggested annotations displayed for the label. If no\\nrecommender is specified in the back end, the label will be left blank. Users can delete turns and navigate between them using\\n2\"Enter\" or the arrow keys. The name of the dialogue being annotated can be seen next to the \"Back\" button at the top left of the\\nscreen and can be edited by clicking on it.\\n3.0.3 Annotating An Existing Dataset\\nDatasets can be uploaded via drag-and-drop to the home screen of the system, or paths can be specified in the back end if the\\nsystem were being used for crowdsourcing. Datasets can be in one of two forms, either a \".txt\" file such as may be produced by a\\ntranscription service, or a formatted \".json\" file, a common format for dialogue data. Once the user has uploaded their data, their\\ndialogue(s) will appear on the home screen. The user can click on each dialogue and will be taken to the single dialogue annotation\\nscreen to annotate it. If the user uploaded a text file, they will be taken to a dialogue and turn segmentation screen. Following the\\nsame constraints imposed in previous works, this turn segmenter assumes that there are only two participants in the dialogue: the\\nuser and the system, and that the user asks the first query. The user separates each utterance in the dialogue by a blank line, and\\nseparates dialogues with a triple equals sign (\"===\"). Once the user clicks \"Done\", the text file will automatically be parsed into the\\ncorrect JSON format and each query run through the recommenders in the back-end to obtain annotation suggestions.\\n3.0.4 Resolving Annotator Disagreement\\nResearchers could use LIDA’s main interface to crowdsource annotations for a dialogue dataset. Once they have several annotations\\nfor each dialogue, they can upload these to the inter-annotator resolution interface of LIDA. The disagreements between annotators\\nwill be detected, with a percentage shown beside each label to show how many annotators selected it. The label with the highest\\npercentage of selections is checked by default. The arbiter can accept the majority label simply by pressing \"Enter\" and can change\\nerrors with the arrow keys to facilitate fast resolution. This interface also displays an averaged (over turns) version of Cohen’s Kappa,\\nthe total number of annotations, the total number of errors, and the averaged (over turns) accuracy.\\n3.1 Features\\nSpecifying Custom LabelsLIDA’s configuration is controlled by a single script in the back end. This script defines which labels\\nwill be displayed in the UI and is easy to extend. Users can define their own labels by altering this configuration script. If a user\\nwishes to add a new label, all they need to do is specify the label’s name, its type (classification or slot-value pair, currently) and the\\npossible values the classification can take. Alongside the label specification, they can also specify a recommender to use for the label\\nvalues. The label will then automatically be displayed in the front end. Note that labels in uploaded datasets will only be displayed if\\nthe label has an entry in the configuration file.\\nCustom RecommendersWhen creating a dialogue dataset from scratch, LIDA is most powerful when used in conjunction with\\nrecommenders which can suggest annotations for user queries to be corrected by the annotator. State-of-the-art tools emphasize the\\nimportance of being able to use recommenders in annotation systems. Users can specify arbitrary ML models to use for each label in\\nLIDA’s back end. The back end is written in Python, the de facto language for machine learning, so researchers can directly integrate\\nmodels written in Python to the back end. This is in contrast to tools such as INCEpTION and GATE which are written in Java\\nand so require extra steps to integrate a Python-based model. To integrate a recommender, the user simply provides an instantiated\\nPython object in the configuration file that has a method called \"transform\" that takes a single string and returns a predicted label.\\nDialogue and Turn Segmentation from Raw DataWhen uploading a .txt file, users can segment each utterance and each dialogue\\nwith a simple interface. This means that raw dialogue data with no labels, such as obtained from a transcription service, can be\\nuploaded and processed into a labelled dialogue. Segmented dialogues and turns are automatically run through every recommender\\nto give suggested labels for each utterance.\\n4 Evaluation\\nTo test LIDA’s capabilities, we designed a simple experiment: we took a bespoke dataset of 154 dialogues with an average of 3.5\\nturns per dialogue and a standard deviation of 1.55. The task was to assign three classification labels to each user utterance in each\\ndialogue. Each annotator was given a time limit of 1 hour and told to annotate as many dialogues as they could in that time. We had\\nsix annotators perform this task, three of whom were familiar with the system and three of whom had never seen it before.\\nThese annotators annotated an average of 79 dialogues in one hour with a standard deviation of 30, which corresponds to an\\naverage of 816.5 individual annotations. The annotators who had never seen the system before annotated an average of 60 dialogues\\ncorresponding to an average of 617 individual annotations.\\nOnce we had these six annotations, we performed a second experiment whereby a single arbiter resolved inter-annotator disagree-\\nments. In one hour, the arbiter resolved 350 disagreements and noted that resolution.\\n3'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Explainable Identification of Hate Speech towards\\nIslam using Graph Neural Networks\\nAbstract\\nIslamophobic language on online platforms fosters intolerance, making detection\\nand elimination crucial for promoting harmony. Traditional hate speech detection\\nmodels rely on NLP techniques like tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and\\nencoder-decoder models. However, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with their\\nability to utilize relationships between data points, offer more effective detection\\nand greater explainability. In this work, speeches are represented as nodes and\\nconnect them with edges based on their context and similarity to develop the graph.\\nA novel paradigm using GNNs to identify and explain hate speech towards Islam is\\nintroduced. The model leverages GNNs to understand the context and patterns of\\nhate speech by connecting texts via pretrained NLP-generated word embeddings,\\nachieving state-of-the-art performance and enhancing detection accuracy while pro-\\nviding valuable explanations. This highlights the potential of GNNs in combating\\nonline hate speech and fostering a safer, more inclusive online environment.\\n1 Introduction\\nDetecting and eliminating hate speech on social media platforms is of utmost importance for the\\npromotion of harmony and tranquility in society. The escalating presence of hate speech specifically\\ntargeting Islam or Muslim communities on online discussion platforms is a growing concern. This\\nform of hate speech not only fosters an environment of intolerance and hostility but can also have\\nsevere psychological impacts on individuals and communities, leading to real-world violence and\\ndiscrimination.\\nTo address this issue, researchers have increasingly turned to advanced technologies; using text-\\nprocessing approaches in AI. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are frequently employed\\nfor hate speech detection, with some offering severity assessment of hate speech. These methods\\nutilize sophisticated algorithms to analyse vast amounts of textual data, identifying patterns and\\nfeatures indicative of hate speech. For instance, deep learning models, like recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs), can learn complex representations of text data, enabling them to detect subtle and context-\\ndependent instances of hate speech. Modern NLP techniques, on the other hand, can enhance these\\nmodels by providing richer linguistic insights. Tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named\\nentity recognition are just a few NLP techniques that help in breaking down and understanding the\\ntext’s structure and meaning. Moreover, the integration of latest NLP model and transformers, like\\nBERT and GPT, has significantly improved the ability of models to understand context, sarcasm, and\\nimplicit hate speech, which are often challenging to detect. Another interesting approach is to use\\nhuman-centric perspectives of AI using some benchmark dataset.\\nResearchers have tried to employ GNNs in hate speech classification, but still needs more focus\\non this area. Despite their potential, GNNs have not been actively employed for the purpose of\\ninterpretable identification of hate speech, particularly in Islamic contexts. Islamophobic content\\noften exhibits close word choices and hate speakers from the same community, which GNNs can\\nleverage to reveal and explain patterns, alongside impressive classification scores.A novel approach employing graph neural networks for the identification and explication of hate\\nspeech directed at Islam (XG-HSI) is introduced. The dataset is pre-processed to focus on Islamic\\ncontexts, utilize pretrained NLP models for word embeddings, establish connections between texts,\\nand employ a series of graph encoders for hate speech target identification, which achieves state-of-\\nthe-art performance.\\n2 Background\\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful neural networks designed for processing non-Euclidean\\ndata organized in complex, interconnected graphs. Using their ability to utilize relations between\\ndifferent data points, GNNs have shown tremendous promise in text classification and detection\\ntasks. GNNs have the ability to enhance hate speech detection on social media by modeling complex\\nrelationships between users and content, capturing contextual information from interactions. They\\npropagate information across the network, identifying coordinated and evolving hate speech patterns.\\nWe also present a case study in Section 5 to illustrate how incorporating related information enhances\\nthe process.\\nA general bag of words-based approach to create graphs, without LLMs is adopted. By integrating\\nwith pretrained NLP models, GNNs leverage contextual word embeddings to better understand the\\nsubtleties of hate speech. This combined approach improves the accuracy, context-awareness, and\\nadaptability of detection systems, making them more effective in identifying hate speech directed at\\nIslam and potentially generalizing to other targeted groups.\\n3 Methodology\\n3.1 Notations\\nLet a graph G = (V , E, X), where V represents nodes, E denotes edges. We also define N and M as the\\nnumbers of nodes and edges, respectively. Each node v is associated with a feature xi ˘2208 RF , and\\nthe node feature matrix for the entire graph is denoted as X ˘2208 RN ˘00d7F , where F represents the\\nfeature vector length. In our approach, each content denotes a node, contextual similarity between\\ntwo nodes is denoted by an edge and word embeddings are node features of the graph. The task\\ninvolves a node classification task to detect hate speech and Islamophobic content.\\n3.2 Data Pre-Processing\\nInitially, the dataset was filtered to focus on hate speech targeting Islam. Next, pretrained NLP models\\nis applied to the text to obtain word embeddings X as node features for all nodes V . Edges E are\\ndetermined using cosine similarity between embeddings with a threshold of 0.725. Subsequently,\\nGNN is applied for the classification task.\\n3.3 Graph Encoder\\nAfter data pre-processing, every data point x ˘2282 X undergoes a series of transformations to get\\noutput p. First, it is processed by a linear layer producing x1 (Equation 1).\\nx1 = W x+ b (1)\\nSubsequently, x1 is passed into two initial graph encoders to aggregate neighborhood information,\\nfeature extraction, and yield x2, x3 utilizing G and concatenated to x23 (Equation 2,3, 4). Here in\\nEquation 2, we aggregate features from a node’s local neighborhood, to learn different characteristics.\\nIn Equation 3 and 4, we use a semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data, employing an\\nefficient variant of convolutional neural networks that operate directly on graphs.\\nx2 = W1x1 + W2 · meanj∈N(i)x1 (2)\\nx3 = W1x1 + ˆAx1 (3)\\n2x23 = concat(x2, x3) (4)\\nHere, N is the set of neighbouring nodes. Following this, x23 is passed through another graph layer\\nemploying attention-based feature extraction, utilizing masked self-attentional layers to implicitly\\nassign different weights to nodes in a neighbourhood, producing x4 (Equation 5 and 6).\\nx4 = αi,iΘx23i +\\nX\\nj∈N(i)\\nαi,jΘx23j (5)\\nαi,j = exp(LeakyReLU (aT [Θx23i||Θx23j]))P\\nk∈N(i) exp(LeakyReLU (aT [Θx23i||Θx23k])) (6)\\nHere, ˘03b8 refers to trainable model weights. ˘03b1 is the attention value, calculated by the equation\\nmentioned.\\nFinally, x4 is passed through a final linear layer to obtain logits pl, which are then subjected to a\\nsoftmax operation to derive probabilities p (Equation 7 amd 8).\\nxc = concat(x1, x4); pl = W xc+ b (7)\\np = softmax(pl) (8)\\n3.4 Loss Function\\nCross Entropy loss is designed to minimize the difference between the predicted probabilities and\\ntrue values, as follows:\\nlce = −\\nnX\\ni=1\\n(pilog(o(pi)) + (1− pi)log(1 − o(pi))) (9)\\n3.5 Graph Explanation\\nGNNExplainer is used to derive explanations from the graph encoder network for interpreting the\\nresults and find underlying relations and causation. It works by taking a trained GNN model and\\nits predictions as input, and returns explanations in the form of compact subgraph structures and\\nsubsets of influential node features. This model-agnostic approach can explain predictions of any\\nGNN-based model on various graph-based machine learning tasks, including node classification,\\nlink prediction, and graph classification. GNNExplainer formulates explanations as rich subgraphs\\nof the input graph, maximizing mutual information with the GNN’s predictions. It achieves this\\nby employing a mean field variational approximation to learn real-valued graph masks that select\\nimportant subgraphs and feature masks that highlight crucial node features. Through this process,\\nGNNExplainer offers insights into the underlying reasoning of GNN predictions, enhancing model\\ninterpretability and facilitating error analysis.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Experimental Setup\\nDataset. HateXplain, a benchmark hate speech dataset designed for addressing bias and interpretabil-\\nity is used. The dataset has hate speech targets labelled. This labelling is used to collect only\\nMuslim-focused sentences and created a subset to work on this project. A 6:2:2 train, validation and\\ntest split is used.\\nBaselines. The baseline models are: CNN-GRU, BiRNN, BiRNN-HateXplain, BERT, BERT-\\nHateXplain. Mentioned HateXplain-based models are fine-tuned on HateXplain dataset.\\n3Implementation Details. Hugging Face transformers library is used to get embeddings from pre-\\ntrained BERT (bert-base-uncased) and BiRNN. The model is trained for 200 epochs with a learning\\nrate of 0.001, using Adam optimizer. The experimental results in Table 1 show that our model achieves\\nremarkable performance comparing to benchmarks with explaining occurring phenomenons.We\\nutilized a single layer for each type of GNN, with a maximum tokenization length of 512 in the\\ntokenizer and length of BERT embeddings (F ) set to 128.\\n4.2 Experimental Results\\nTable 1 shows the performance of various models in detecting hate speech, highlighting accuracy and\\nMacro F1 metrics. Traditional models like CNN-GRU and BiRNN show lower performance, with\\nBiRNN-HateXplain offering slight improvements. BERT-based models perform better, particularly\\nBERT-HateXplain. However, our proposed models, XG-HSI-BiRNN and XG-HSI-BERT, signifi-\\ncantly outperform all others, with XG-HSI-BERT achieving the highest accuracy (0.741) and Macro\\nF1 (0.747). These results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our dual GNN approach in hate\\nspeech detection.\\nTable 1: Experimental Results (˘2191)\\nModel Accuracy Macro F1\\nCNN-GRU 0.628 0.604\\nBiRNN 0.591 0.578\\nBiRNN-HateXplain 0.612 0.621\\nBERT 0.692 0.671\\nBERT-HateXplain 0.693 0.681\\nXG-HSI-BiRNN (Ours) 0.742 0.737\\nXG-HSI-BERT (Ours) 0.751 0.747\\n5 Graph Explanation Case Study\\nFor a given post, \"How is all that awesome Muslim diversity going for you native germans? You\\nhave allowed this yourselves. If you do not stand and fight against this. You get what you asked for\\nwhat you deserve!\", the predicted classification was offensive towards Islam. As per the explainer,\\nthe neighbouring and self-tokens helped to classify this as offensive to Muslims are fight, Muslim\\ndiversity, brooks, rish, donald, syrian, schultz, typed. The text’s association of \"Muslim diversity\"\\nwith potential blame and its confrontational tone in phrases like \"stand and fight against this,\"\\ncombined with neighbouring tokens like syrians, brooks, syrians denoted negative sentiment.\\n6 Discussion\\nThis study not only addresses the immediate challenge of identifying and explaining hate speech\\ndirected at Islam but also recognizes the broader impact of hate speech propagation on online\\nplatforms. The proliferation of Islamophobic language fosters intolerance, division, and hostility\\nwithin communities, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and prejudices. By leveraging GNNs in our\\nXG-HSI framework, we not only detect hate speech but also provide explanations for its occurrence,\\nshedding light on the underlying factors driving such behaviour. GNNs excel in capturing complex\\nrelationships and patterns within data, enabling them to effectively identify instances of hate speech\\nand elucidate the contextual nuances surrounding them. By leveraging the inherent structure of social\\nnetworks and textual data, our approach offers a comprehensive understanding of how hate speech\\npropagates in online discourse.\\nIn future research, exploring the integration of multimodal data sources, such as images and videos,\\ncould enhance the robustness of hate speech detection models, particularly in detecting nuanced\\nforms of Islamophobic content. Additionally, investigating the dynamic nature of online communities\\nand incorporating temporal aspects into GNN architectures could provide deeper insights into the\\nevolution of hate speech propagation and enable more proactive interventions to counter its spread.\\n47 Conclusion\\nIdentifying and addressing Islamophobic hatred on social media is crucial for achieving harmony\\nand peace. This research presents a novel method using GNNs to detect hate speech towards Islam.\\nEmpirical findings demonstrate that our model achieves exceptional performance, significantly\\noutperforming all others, with XG-HSI-BERT achieving the highest accuracy (0.741) and Macro F1\\n(0.747). Explainability aspect of this approach is also very promising, as it provides insights into\\nboth correlations and causation. This further highlights the potential of GNNs in combating online\\nhate speech and fostering a safer, more inclusive online environment.\\nLimitations\\nThe limitations include the use of only one dataset, which, while sufficient for this initial exploration,\\nshould be expanded upon in future research to validate and extend our findings. Additionally, while\\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to be computationally intensive, especially with large-\\nscale datasets, the relatively limited number of hate speech keywords suggests that GNNs may still\\nbe highly effective. Furthermore, more efficient GNN training methods are now available, which\\naddress some of the computational challenges in future applications.\\nEthical Implications\\nOur work on using GNNs to detect hate speech targeting Islam carries significant ethical responsibili-\\nties. We focus on minimizing biases in the model to ensure fair treatment of all groups, emphasizing\\nthe need for transparency in how the model arrives at its decisions. By using interpretable GNN\\nmethods, we strive to provide clear explanations for the model’s classifications, allowing for greater\\naccountability. We also acknowledge the potential risks of misuse and take steps to prevent these,\\nadhering to ethical guidelines that respect privacy and avoid unjust censorship.\\nSocietal Implications\\nThe societal impact lies in its potential to create a safer online environment by effectively identifying\\nand mitigating Islamophobic content. By enhancing the detection accuracy and providing clear\\nexplanations for the identified hate speech, our model contributes to fostering more inclusive and\\nrespectful online communities. Additionally, our work highlights the importance of combating digital\\nhate speech, which can lead to real-world harm. We aim to empower platforms and policymakers\\nwith tools that uphold freedom of expression while curbing harmful rhetoric, thus promoting social\\nharmony and understanding.\\nPotential Risks\\nThe application of our model presents several risks. One major concern is the potential for model\\nmisclassification, which could lead to false positives or negatives, impacting users unfairly. Addition-\\nally, there is a risk of over-reliance on automated systems, which might not capture nuanced contexts\\nand could inadvertently suppress legitimate speech. Annotation errors can also induce bias, but as\\nwe used a previously peer-reviewed benchmark dataset, we hope those type of concerns are already\\naddressed.\\nAcknowledgements\\nSincere gratitude to the Computational Intelligence and Operations Laboratory (CIOL) for all their\\nsupport.

       "  'file_content': 'Enhancing Self-Consistency and Performance of\\nPre-Trained Language Models through Natural\\nLanguage Inference\\nAbstract\\nWhile large pre-trained language models are powerful, their predictions often\\nlack logical consistency across test inputs. For example, a state-of-the-art Macaw\\nquestion-answering (QA) model answers Yes to Is a sparrow a bird? and Does\\na bird have feet? but answers No to Does a sparrow have feet?. To address this\\nfailure mode, we propose a framework, Consistency Correction through Relation\\nDetection, or ConCoRD, for boosting the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained\\nNLP models using pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models without\\nfine-tuning or re-training. Given a batch of test inputs, ConCoRD samples several\\ncandidate outputs for each input and instantiates a factor graph that accounts for\\nboth the model’s belief about the likelihood of each answer choice in isolation and\\nthe NLI model’s beliefs about pair-wise answer choice compatibility. We show that\\na weighted MaxSAT solver can efficiently compute high-quality answer choices\\nunder this factor graph, improving over the raw model’s predictions. Our experi-\\nments demonstrate that ConCoRD consistently boosts accuracy and consistency of\\noff-the-shelf closed-book QA and VQA models using off-the-shelf NLI models,\\nnotably increasing accuracy of LXMERT on ConVQA by 5\\n1 Introduction\\nReliable and trustworthy AI systems should demonstrate internal self-consistency, in the sense that\\ntheir predictions across inputs should imply logically compatible beliefs about the world. However,\\neven powerful large language models are known to lack self-consistency. For example, a question-\\nanswering (QA) model that answers the question Is a sparrow a bird? and Does a bird have feet?\\nwith Yes is implicitly expressing the belief that A sparrow is a bird and A bird has feet. If the\\nsame model answers the question Does a sparrow have feet? with No, the model expresses the\\nlogically incompatible belief A sparrow does not have feet. In such cases, ascertaining the model’s\\n˘201ctrue˘201d belief is difficult, making interpreting and validating its behavior correspondingly\\nchallenging.\\nPrior work has improved model self-consistency by training with specialized loss functions or data\\naugmentation, or alternatively re-ranking model predictions based on their mutual self-consistency\\nusing pre-written logical constraints, such as ˘201call mammals have fur˘201d. However, the first class\\nof methods requires expensive fine-tuning which might be impractical for many practitioners for\\nvery large pre-trained models, and re-ranking methods require an explicit collection of the logical\\nrelations of interest, making scaling a challenge. Still, re-ranking-based approaches have the benefit\\nof not requiring fine-tuning, and we hypothesize that their scalability limitations may be addressed by\\nestimating logical relationships between model predictions on the fly. Specifically, we hypothesize\\nthat existing pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) models can estimate logical relationships\\nbetween an arbitrary pair of model predictions well enough to provide an effective, scalable substitute\\nfor explicit collection of such constraints. Leveraging these estimated constraints, we can constructa factor graph representing a probability distribution over model outputs that incorporates both the\\noriginal model’s confidence scores and the NLI model’s beliefs about logical relationships.\\nOur primary contribution is Consistency Correction through Relation Detection, or ConCoRD, a\\nframework to improve the consistency and performance of a pre-trained base language model without\\nfine-tuning by using more confident and better attested model predictions to override less confident\\nmodel beliefs. To enable propagation of model beliefs, we estimate pair-wise logical relationships\\nbetween model predictions using a pre-trained NLI model. Using these pair-wise relationships, we\\ndefine an undirected graphical model representing a distribution over responses accounting for both\\nthe base model’s beliefs and the NLI model’s estimates of answer compatibility. We efficiently find\\nthe approximate mode of this distribution among the base model’s top answer choices for each input\\nas the solution of a MaxSAT problem, which consistently produces more accurate and self-consistent\\npredictions than using the raw model predictions. We find that ConCoRD produces an 8.1\\n2 Related Work\\nPrior work for maintaining consistency in the question-answering space often involves additional\\ntraining to improve performance. Some work generates questions from unlabeled texts, then filters\\nthem to ensure roundtrip consistency; pre-training on this synthetic set improves performance on\\nSQuAD 2.0 and Natural Questions. Other work augments QA-pairs with their logically symmetric\\nand transitive counterparts through linguistic approaches to enhance cross-dataset QA performance.\\nConCoRD differs significantly from these question-answering-specific approaches because no fine-\\ntuning of the base model is needed and the methodology is not specific to question-answering.\\nSimilarly to ConCoRD, other work re-rank model predictions by solving an optimization problem\\ndefined by a combination of the base model confidence scores and pair-wise constraints representing\\nthe logical compatibility of different model predictions stored in a persistent memory, which they\\ncall BeliefBank. The key distinguishing property of ConCoRD is the fact that pair-wise constraints\\nbetween model predictions are dynamically estimated by a pre-trained NLI model, rather than drawn\\nfrom a fixed, pre-collected set of constraints. Dynamically estimating the constraints has a variety of\\nbenefits, eliminating the need for manually collecting the logical constraints of interest, automating\\nthe process of determining whether a particular constraint applies to a particular pair of predictions,\\nand likely inheriting improvements in Natural language inference (NLI) models over time.\\nNLI has long been used to maintain logical consistency in generated dialogue utterances, radiology\\nreport domain entities, and summarization. Perhaps most similarly, other work uses NLI to estimate\\nconstraints between factual statements produced by GPT-3. These prior approaches support our\\nintuition for using NLI models to improve logical consistency among batches of answers. While the\\nauthors explore applications of this framework to multi-step reasoning for True/False questions or\\nstatements, our work focuses on applying this methodology to more general settings, such as VQA,\\nopen-ended QA, and model editing.\\n3 Consistency Correction through Relation Detection\\nConCoRD contains three key components, the base model, a relation model (typically a pre-trained\\nNLI model), and an inference procedure that combines the predictions of the two models into a more\\naccurate and self-consistent set of beliefs. Importantly, both the base model and relation model are\\npre-trained, off-the-shelf models; ConCoRD does not update any weights or require training data\\nfor either model, using only a small validation set for hyperparameter tuning. We next explain the\\nfunction of each of these components when executing ConCoRD.\\n3.1 Base Model\\nThe core function of the base model in ConCoRD is generating a set of candidate outputs for a given\\ninput, which are ultimately re-ranked by the inference process (Sec. 3.3). Given a batch of N model\\nqueries Q = {qi}, the first step of ConCoRD is to generate a set of J candidate outputs for each query\\nˆAi = {ˆai1, ...,ˆaiJ}, along with their corresponding likelihoods pθ(ˆaij|qi). Note that the candidate\\noutputs need not be an IID sample from the base model; for example, we might use beam search\\nwith a diversity bonus to produce a more diverse set of candidates. Each pair of query and candidate\\n2output forms a model belief bij = (qi, ˆaij); the output of the base model is the complete set of model\\nbeliefs B = {bij} and their corresponding normalized probabilities pij. The base models in our\\nexperiments are pre-trained question-answering models based on T5-large and pre-trained visual\\nquestion-answering models such as LXMERT and ViLT.\\n3.2 Relation Model\\nThe relation model pθ(: |xi, x′) estimates the most likely logical relationship between an ordered pair\\nof natural language utterances from the choices {none, fwd− entail, contradict, equivalence}.\\nIn addition to the model beliefs B, we define optional context statements cijk = C(bij), K relevant\\nstatements that may be retrieved, generated, or manually written for each model belief. The ability\\nto incorporate context statements enables ConCoRD to modulate model behavior independently for\\neach input in the test batch, rather than reasoning transductively about pairs of test inputs. Inputs\\nto the relation model are either pairs of two model beliefs (bij, bi′j′ ) or pairs of one model belief\\nand one context statement (bij, cijk). We define the most likely inter-belief relation as rij,i′j′ =\\nargmaxrpθ(r|bij, bi′j′ ), and similarly for belief-context relations rij,k = argmaxrpθ(r|bij, cijk).\\nThe output of the relation model is the set of most-likely relations R = {rij,i′j′ } ∪ {rij,k} and\\ntheir associated probabilities, which we denote as pij,i′j′\\nϕ and pij,k\\nϕ . Our experiments use various\\npre-trained NLI models based on RoBERTa and ALBERT as the relation model.\\nQuestion-answer to statement conversion.While concatenating query qi and candidate output ˆaij\\nto produce inputs to the relation model is perhaps the simplest approach to estimating soft constraints,\\nwe use a statement conversion model to provide inputs to the relation model that are closer to its\\ntraining distribution. Instead of defining the belief bij = (qi, ˆaij) as concatenation of qi and ˆaij, we\\ndefine bij to be the statement fϕ(qi, ˆaij), where fϕ is the conversion model. We fine-tune a small\\nT5 model on a combination of data from and BeliefBank to produce a model that maps a (question,\\nanswer) pair into a natural language statement.\\n3.3 Inference\\nConCoRD’s inference procedure maps the set of beliefs B and pair-wise relations R into a choice\\nof the most likely belief for each question. To define the inference problem, we first define a binary\\ndecision variable zij representing the estimated truth value of model belief bij. A value of 1 for node\\nzij in the maximum likelihood configuration means that ˆaij is returned for query qi; the problem\\nincludes a constraint that exactly one candidate answer is true for each query. The factor graph\\nincludes the set of variables Z = {zij}N,J\\ni,j=1,1 and various factors (functions mapping a subset of\\nZ to a non-negative scalar) derived from the base model and relation model’s beliefs and the hard\\nconstraint of returning only one answer per question. Factors are defined such that more desirable\\nconfigurations of zij yield a larger product of the individual factors. First, unary factors ϕij(zij)\\nencode the base model’s beliefs about the likelihood of specific answers, and are defined as:\\nϕij(zij) = {pij ifzij = 11 − pijotherwise (1)\\nwhere pij = pθ(ˆaij|qi); in other words, the factor takes the odds ratio if the corresponding statement\\nvariable zij is assigned a truth value of 1; otherwise, the factor takes value 1. In order to encode the\\nhard constraint that exactly one output should be returned for each query, we include a J-ary factor\\nϕi(Zi) for each group of nodes Zi = {zij}J\\nj=1, which is equal to 1 for configurations where exactly\\none of the nodes takes a value of 1, and 0 for all other configurations.\\nBinary factors ψij,i′j′ (zij, zi′j′ ) and optionally ψijk(zij, cijk) encode compatibility between pairs of\\nmodel beliefs (or model belief-context pairs):\\nψij,i′j′ (zij, zi′j′ ) = {1 ifrij,i′j′ (zij, zi′j′ )pij,i′j′\\nϕ otherwise (2)\\nwhere we define the relation function rij,i′j′ to evaluate to true if its arguments satisfy the underlying\\nrelation, and false otherwise; ψijk(zij, cijk) is defined similarly to ψij,i′j′ (zij, zi′j′ ). The inference\\nproblem amounts to finding argmaxZΦ(Z), where\\nΦ(Z) =\\nY\\ni\\nϕi\\nY\\nij\\nϕij\\nY\\nij,i′j′\\nψij,i′j′\\nY\\nijk\\nψijk (3)\\n3An approximate solution to this inference problem can be efficiently found for most problems with a\\nMaxSAT solver such as RC2. We omit arguments to the factors for conciseness.\\nEntailment correction. Consider a belief b, a set of its entailed statements S = {si}, unary\\nfactors ϕ(zb) and {ϕ(zsi )}, and binary factors Ψ = {ψ(zb, zsi )}i. Recall that an entailment relation\\nrij,i′j′ (zij, zi′j′ ) is satisfied (and the binary factor is maximized) if either zb = 0 or all zsi = 1.\\nConsequently, as the cardinality of {zs|zsi = 0} increases, the more likely it is that zb = 0 will\\nmaximize the product of all binary factors Q\\ni ψ(zb, zsi ). This is true even if most entailed statements\\nare true, ie., |{zs|zsi = 1}| > |{zs|zsi = 0}|. If most of the statements entailed by a belief are\\ntrue, assigning the belief to be false due to a small number of (potentially spuriously) false entailed\\nstatements may be undesirable. To mitigate this outcome, we experiment with an additional type of\\nfactor in which configurations satisfying entailments with both zb = 1 and zsi = 1 are ’rewarded’\\nmore than other configurations satisfying the entailment:\\nΨb,si (zb, zsi ) = {1 ifzb, zsi = 11 − pb,si\\nϕ ifzb, zsi = 0\\nq\\n1 − pb,si\\nϕ otherwise (4)\\nApplying entailment correction consistently improves ConCoRD’s performance.\\n3.4 Hyperparameters of ConCoRD\\nWe introduce two key hyperparameters to ConCoRD. Because we do not know a priori the relative\\nreliability of the base model and relation model, we introduce the hyperparameter δ ∈ [0, 1], corre-\\nsponding to a trade-off between the predictions of the base model and relation model. A value of\\nδ = 1 corresponds to simply taking the raw predictions of the base model, whileδ = 0 corresponds to\\noptimizing purely for answers that are self-consistent according to the relation model, without consid-\\nering the base model’s beliefs. The unary factors in the factor graph becomeϕi(zi) = (ϕij(zij))δ and\\nψij,i′j′ (zij, zi′j′ ) = (ψij,i′j′ (zij, zi′j′ ))1−δ (and similarly for ψijk). In addition to δ, we introduce a\\nthreshold λ for relation model confidence to filter out low-confidence relation estimates. That is, we\\ndiscard a relation rij,i′j′ or rij,k if pij,i′j′\\nϕ < λor pij,k\\nϕ < λ, respectively. In practice, we find that the\\noptimal δ and λ vary across problems, perhaps due to the varying complexity of the model belief and\\ncontext statements (and therefore the reliability of the relation model’s predictions). Therefore, we\\nuse the hyperopt library for automated hyperparameter optimization, using the Tree Parzen Estimator\\n(TPE) algorithm to tune δ and λ jointly. We use the optimal hyperparameters found on the validation\\ndata for each problem to compute test performance.\\n4 Experiments\\nOur experiments are broadly designed to answer the high-level question: can ConCoRD leverage the\\nrelational knowledge in pre-trained NLI models to produce more accurate, self-consistent system\\nbehavior, without additional data or fine-tuning? Further, we investigate ConCoRD’s applicability to\\nperforming test-time model editing, or injection of new information, and ConCoRD’s sensitivity to\\nthe choice of hyperparameters and types of relations detected.\\n4.1 Internal Consistency in Closed-Book Question-Answering\\nProtocol. To evaluate the accuracy and consistency of a set B of beliefs, we synthesize a gold standard\\nfor those beliefs and the inferred relations R. Following this prior work, we assume the following is\\ngiven:\\n• A set of entities sm ∈ S\\n• A set of unary predicates Pn ∈ P\\n• A collection of ˘201cfacts˘201d (Pn(sm))i, whose binary truth value is known\\n• A directed graph of gold-standard constraints G(P, E), whose edges (Pi, Pj) ∈ E represent\\nfirst-order logical formulae\\nFrom these, we construct simple yes/no questions using natural language templates. For example,\\nfor fact Pn(sm), if entity sm represents a lion and predicate Pn represents an ability to drink liquids,\\n4the template-generated gold question answer pair (qi, ai) is Q: Is it true that a lion is able to drink\\nliquids?; A: Yes.\\nWe evaluate ConCoRD by sampling candidate answers from the top-2 output sizes of a multi-angle\\nquestion answering model, given a multiple choice angle with choices Yes and No. The questions\\nand retrieved answers (qi, ˆai) form a set of beliefs Bsm for each entity. Since these are closed-book\\nquestions, no context statements are supplied; because they are yes/no questions, only one candidate\\nanswer is obtained, i.e., J = 1. Question-answer to statement conversion is applied to all questions\\nwith a default answer of Yes regardless of the answer ˆai, in order to provide the relation model with\\npositive natural language assertions from which to infer sets of relations Rsm; where the base model\\nanswers ˆai are No we replace node zi in the factor graph with its complement. Configurations Zsm\\nare found for each sm ∈ S which maximize Equation 2 given Bsm, Rsm and together form a global\\nsolution Z.\\nDatasets. We use a database with 12,636 facts (˘201csilver facts˘201d), each indicating whether one of\\n601 predicates relates to one of 85 entities, as well as 4,060 confidence-weighted first-order constraints\\nmanually gathered from ConceptNet, forming a constraint graph G. Additionally, they provide 1,072\\ndistinct ˘201ccalibration facts˘201d, each relating one of 7 entities to one of 334 predicates.\\nWe tune β and λ using a validation set of questions generated from the calibration facts, and evaluate\\ntest time performance with questions generated from silver facts.\\nMetrics. We measure accuracy using binary F1 between elements zi of the configuration Z maxi-\\nmizing ϕ(Z) (as in Equation 2), and the truth value of facts (Pn(sm))i. We use F1 for evaluation\\nbecause gold answers are highly biased towards true No answers.\\nWe compute consistency within batches of questions using the complement of of conditional constraint\\nviolation metric τ, defined here as the proportion of relevant gold constraints in G which are violated;\\na constraint ∀(Pi(x) → Pj(x)) is relevant iff, for some entity s, there is some belief bi ∈ B, sm\\nfrom fact (Pi(sm))i such that zi = 1, and there is some belief bj ∈ Bsm that corresponds to fact\\n(Pj(sm))j; the constraint is violated when zj = 0.\\nComparisons. ConCoRD is evaluated against a naive baseline where only base model answersˆai\\nand probabilities are considered. A second baseline (G.C.) performs the inference described in Sec.\\n3.3, replacing the inferred relations R with the gold constraints from constraint graph G, rather than\\nthose estimated by the relation model.\\nResults. Results are shown in Table 1. ConCoRD provides an absolute improvement of over\\n8% in F1 and consistency for Macaw-Large and 7% for Macaw-3B compared to the baseline.\\nNotably, the margin of superiority of the Macaw-3B base model is mostly preserved after applying\\nConCoRD, suggesting that ConCoRD may provide a significant benefit even for very large models.\\nA surprising result is that ConCoRD shows marked improvements in F1 over the gold constraint\\nbaseline, suggesting that the detection and filtering of relations ConCoRD provides may, in this\\nsetting, be an improvement over rigid adherence to the logical connections specified a priori.\\nTable 1: F1 and consistency (1 - τ ) for two sizes of Macaw QA models, comparing ConCoRD to\\na naive QA baseline (Base) and ConCoRD with gold constraints (G.C.).

The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task involves a language model generating answers\\nto questions that are directly associated with images. VQA tests for robustness and generalizability\\nof ConCoRD as it introduces an additional layer of difficulty; the task moves away from purely\\ntext-based tasks while expanding the answer space to the vocabulary of the LM being used. The\\nquestions from the ConVQA dataset and its associated images from the Visual Genome dataset\\n5provide an apt setting to assess ConCoRD, as the relatedness of questions for each image provide\\nample opportunity for model self-inconsistency.\\nThe ConVQA dataset consists of a set of images each associated with a group of related questions\\nabout the image, such as What color is the horse? and Is the horse brown? for a picture of a brown\\nhorse in a stable. We evaluate ConCoRD with two VQA models, LXMERT and ViLT. For each group\\nof questions Qn = {qni}i, we sample the top-2 candidate outputs {ˆani1, ˆani2} for each question,\\nand use a pre-trained NLI model to infer the most likely pair-wise relations R between outputs from\\ndifferent questions. We use the RC2 MaxSAT Solver to estimate the configuration that maximizes\\nEquation 2.\\nMetrics. We report accuracy as the proportion of questions answered correctly across all groups.\\nWe infer consistency using a metric previously used in the literature for the ConVQA dataset called\\n˘201cperfect consistency˘201d. For all groups of related questions, a group is perfectly consistent if\\nall its questions are answered correctly. Perfect consistency then reports the proportion of question\\ngroups that were perfectly consistent. While this is not a perfect measure of consistency as it excludes\\ncases in which incorrect answers are consistent with each other, it still serves as a meaningful proxy\\nsince the dataset was designed such that any incorrect answer in a question group implies the presence\\nof inconsistency.\\nDatasets. We divide the ConVQA dataset into a ˘201cclean˘201d (i.e. human verified and filtered)\\ntest set and a non-test set (train + val + test as defined by previous work). From the non-test set, we\\nsample 10,000 random images equivalent to 123,746 questions to be used as our validation set for\\ntuning our two hyperparameters. We use the clean test set ˘2013 725 images and 6,751 questions ˘2013\\nto report our final results.\\nComparisons. ConCoRD is compared with a naive baseline and a top-2 oracle upper bound. The\\nnaive baseline is the answer with the highest VQA model probability. Top-2 oracle upper bound\\nselects the correct answer if present within the top-2 predictions of the VQA model. Top-2 is\\nappropriate given our use of the top-2 candidate outputs to generate inferences with NLI models.\\nResults. The final results for ConCoRD, baseline, and oracle upper bound are shown in Table\\n2. ConCoRD increases the accuracy of LXMERT and ViLT by 5% and 2% respectively, and the\\nconsistency of LXMERT and ViLT by 4.9% and 5.9% respectively.\\nTable 2: ConVQA accuracy (Acc.) and perfect consistency (P.C.) of LXMERT and ViLT VQA\\nmodels with and without ConCoRD. ConCoRD significantly improves accuracy and consistency of\\nboth models. Oracle performance is top-2 performance, as ConCoRD attempts to select the best of\\nthe top 2 answer choices of the base model.\\n2*Model Base ConCoRD Oracle\\nAcc. P.C. Acc. P.C. Acc.

We perform an additional experiment to evaluate ConCoRD’s ability to integrate external\\nfactual information into its inference process, rather than only using other predictions in the test\\nbatch. Such an ability enables editing a model’s behavior at test time, without re-training, as new\\ninformation becomes available. We use the Natural Questions (NQ) dataset, rather than BeliefBank,\\nto provide more challenging inputs to the relation model. Given a question from NQ, a sentence\\nfrom the ground truth context document containing information about the answer is retrieved and\\nprovided as an additional input to ConCoRD; we constrain the node representing this context variable\\nin the factor graph to be true. Constraints are predicted between each answer choice and the context\\nstatement. As in the other experimental settings, hyperparameters are tuned on the validation set and\\napplied on the test set.\\nMetrics. Model performance is evaluated using the SQuAD F1 score for overlapping tokens, follow-\\ning the same answer normalization protocols, including lower-casing and removing punctuation.\\n6Datasets. The NQ development set consists of 7830 open-book question-answer pairs, with both\\nlong and short gold annotations in their context passages. Since the NQ test set is not available, we\\ncreate a test and validation set from the NQ validation questions as follows: we take the first 5000\\nquestions to form our test set, and the rest to be our val set, which we use for hyperparameter tuning.\\nThen each set is filtered such that only the answerable questions remain. ˘201cAnswerable˘201d is\\ndefined as having a ˘201cshort answer¨span defined in the annotations. This filtering process gives\\n2713 test entries and 1576 val entries.\\nComparisons. ConCoRD is compared with a naive baseline and an oracle upper bound. All of\\nthese approaches operate on the fixed set of QA model answers for a specific QA model (one of\\nT5-Sm-NQ, T5-Lg-NQ, and T5-3B-NQ), specifically the set of top-4 answers for each question. The\\nnaive baseline selects the answer with the highest QA model probability, argmaxˆaij pθ(ˆaij|qi). The\\noracle upper bound approach selects the answer that has the best score with the gold short answer\\nspan, argmaxˆaij F1(ˆaij, aij).\\nResults. The results on the test set using the naive baseline, ConCoRD, and oracle upper-bound\\nare reported in Table 4. ConCoRD always outperforms the naive approach, demonstrating that the\\nframework is useful even when each query input is processed independently (i.e., non-transductively).\\nHowever, despite providing a relative gain of as high as 8.7% over the naive baseline, there is still a\\ngap between ConCoRD and the oracle. This gap may be attributable to the complexity of the NQ\\nquestions and context information compared with the statements in prior experimental settings. Other\\nwork demonstrates a significant gain in calibration performance from training on MultiNLI to training\\non a combination of MultiNLI and their NLI corpus adapted from NQ, perhaps hinting that crucial\\nknowledge present in Natural Questions is not covered in MultiNLI, partially explaining the gap\\nbetween ConCoRD and oracle F1 performance. Overall, these results suggest that ConCoRD can\\nreason between context statements and model beliefs in addition to pairs of model beliefs, improving\\nperformance even with the increased complexity of the data.\\nTable 3: Using ConCoRD to inject contextual information into a model’s decisions at test time.\\nInjecting gold Natural Questions contexts consistently improves performance over the base model\\nwithout requiring fine-tuning.\\n2*Model F1\\nBase ConCoRD Oracle\\nT5-Sm-NQ 0.207 0.225 0.281\\nT5-Lg-NQ 0.314 0.328 0.393\\nT5-3B-NQ 0.332 0.351 0.423\\n4.4 Ablating Relation Types\\nGiven that we consider two types of relations in our experiments, contradiction and entailment, it is\\nnatural to wonder the relative contribution of these to ConCoRD’s performance improvement; Table\\n5 shows the results of this ablation. We re-run ConCoRD with either entailment or contradiction\\nrelations removed, re-tuning the hyperparameters for both of the new settings (contradiction-only\\nor entailment-only). We find that the relative contribution of contradiction and entailment relations\\nvaries significantly across models even within the same task, but using both relation types always\\nperforms approximately as well or better than using just one, suggesting that both types of detected\\nrelations from the NLI model carry useful information. However, we observe in several cases, such\\nas ViLT and the T5 models, that the entailment and contradiction relations may encode somewhat\\nredundant information, as the performance when including either type of constraint alone nearly\\nmatches that of using both types.\\n5 Conclusion\\nThis paper presents a novel method, ConCoRD, for enhancing the self-consistency and performance\\nof pre-trained language models without requiring fine-tuning. ConCoRD leverages pre-trained NLI\\nmodels to estimate logical relationships between model predictions and uses a MaxSAT solver to\\nenforce consistency. The experimental results demonstrate that ConCoRD improves over off-the-shelf\\n7Table 4: Ablating the relation types considered in ConCoRD˘2019s inference procedure.

       "  'file_content': 'A Vehicle Motion Prediction Approach for the 2021\\nShifts Challenge\\nAbstract\\nThis paper details the solution developed for the 2021 Shifts Challenge, which\\nfocused on robustness and uncertainty in real-world distributional shifts. The\\ncompetition sought methods for addressing motion prediction in cross-domain\\nscenarios. A key issue is the variance between input and ground truth data distribu-\\ntions, known as the domain shift problem. The method proposed features a novel\\narchitecture utilizing a self-attention mechanism and a specifically designed loss\\nfunction. Ultimately, this approach achieved 3rd place in the competition.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper examines the crucial issue of prediction in autonomous driving. Predicting vehicle\\ntrajectories to generate control commands is essential for avoiding collisions. While deep learning\\nhas shown promise in specific domains, real-world conditions, such as varying environments, weather,\\nand driver behaviors, create challenges for models trained on single datasets. These models may not\\nperform well across diverse datasets.\\nThe 2021 Shifts Challenge concentrated on prediction tasks across different domains. The goal was\\nto predict 25 timestamps of trajectories from given raster images. To address this, a new architecture\\nwas developed using insights from current research. The feature extractor was modified using NFNet\\nfor stability, and a self-attention layer was included to enhance time-related predictions. The loss\\nfunction was also adjusted for improved robustness, leading to a 3rd place ranking with 8.637 R-AUC\\nCNLL in the competition.\\n2 Our Solution\\nThis section explains the solution for the domain-shift problem through the design of new model\\narchitectures. The domain-shift problem arises when training and validation datasets come from\\ndifferent distributions. Given input raster images X that contain the first 5 seconds of vehicle data, the\\nobjective is to predict the last 5 seconds of trajectories Y for the objects. These images include details\\nabout the positions, orientations, accelerations, and velocities of dynamic objects. The proposed\\nmodel has two main parts: (1) a new backbone model and feature extractor, and (2) a revised loss\\nfunction for better performance.\\n[width=0.8]./Recurrentmodel.png\\nFigure 1: Base Model Architecture: The baseline model uses the backbone model to extract features\\nand utilizes recurrent model to generate prediction according to latent vectors.\\n2.1 Baseline Model\\nThe competition provided two baseline models and used an ensemble method to improve robustness.\\nBoth Behavior Cloning (BC) and Deep Imitation Model (DIM) use convolutional backbones to\\n.convert raster image data into a latent vector, and then apply an autoregressive model to predict\\nvehicle paths based on the latent vector. BC models the autoregressive likelihood as a single-variate\\nGaussian, while DIM uses a multivariate normal distribution. After assessing the performance of BC\\nand DIM, BC was selected as the baseline due to its better performance. The BC method is broken\\ndown into two components: the feature extraction backbone and the recurrent model.\\nFeature Extraction BackboneUsing the input raster image X, a feature extraction backbone and a\\nself-attention layer (described below) are used to encode both spatial and temporal information about\\ndynamic objects into a latent embedding.\\nZ = f(X) (1)\\nThe baseline applies MobileNetV1 as its backbone. MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3 were also\\nconsidered but produced worse results, likely due to the simplicity of input data and model complexity.\\nUltimately, the NFNet was chosen as the backbone (feature extractor) because of its training stability.\\nSelf-Attention Layer To further refine the raster image features, a self-attention layer was in-\\ncorporated. Self-attention, a key part of the Transformer model, allows for the consideration of\\nlong-range dependencies and global information. The feature map was divided into pixel groups, and\\nself-attention was used to aggregate pixel-wise information.\\nRecurrent Model The GRU model was selected for the recurrent component due to superior\\nperformance compared to other models. Using the embedding from feature extraction as hidden\\nstates, the recurrent model makes predictions recursively. Given the embedding Zt at time t, with the\\noutput vector Y0 as zero vector, the recurrent model g is used to generate predictions:\\nZt = gencoder(Yt−1, Zt−1) (2)\\nYt = gdecoder(Yt−1, Zt) (3)\\nWhere Yt ∈ RB×T×2 represents the vehicle’s position on a 2D bird’s-eye-view map, andZt ∈ RB×K\\nrepresents the hidden vector. B and T refer to the batch and time dimensions, respectively.\\n2.2 Loss Function\\nThe model was initially trained using negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss. However, because of the\\ninadequate performance of the model on Average Distance Error (ADE) and Final Distance Error\\n(FDE), these metrics were added to minimize the distance between predicted and actual positions.\\nNLL(Y ) =−log(p(Y )) (4)\\nLoss = −log(p(Y ; θ)) +γ1||Y − ˆY || + γ2||Yf − ˆYf || (5)\\nHere, p(Y ; θ) indicates the probability of a predicted trajectory Y based on model parameters θ. Yf\\nrepresents the trajectory’s final location. In the equation, the first component is the original loss, the\\nsecond is the ADE loss, and the last is the FDE loss.\\n2.3 Ensemble Method\\nTo improve performance, the Robust Imitative Planning (RIP) method was employed to combine\\nseveral models.\\n3 Experiments\\n3.1 Dataset and Evaluation\\nDataset The dataset provided by Yandex Self-Driving Group was utilized for motion prediction. The\\ntraining set contains 27036 scenes, and the testing set contains 9569 scenes. The dataset for the Shifts\\n2Vehicle Motion Prediction includes 600000 scenes that vary in season, weather, location and time of\\nday.\\nEvaluations metrics The evaluation used three metrics: Average Distance Error (ADE), Final\\nDistance Error (FDE), and Negative log-likelihood (NLL). ADE measures the sum of squared errors\\nbetween predicted and actual positions at each time step. FDE calculates the sum of squared errors of\\nthe final positions. NLL measures the unlikelihood of predicted trajectories matching the actual ones.\\n3.2 Implementation Details\\nModels were trained on a single V100 machine for one day, with a batch size of 512 and a learning\\nrate of 1e-4. Input feature maps were resized to 128 x 128. The AdamW optimizer and gradient\\nclipping with a value of 1.0 was used.\\n3.3 Ablation Study and Comparison Results\\nAblation StudyTable 1 displays the results of the ablation study. The baselines selected were\\nDIM and BC. Various backbones, including EfficientNet, NFNet, and MobileNet, were compared,\\nbut models with more parameters performed worse. This result suggests that simpler models are\\nsufficient for extracting raster image information. Adding a self-attention mechanism improved the\\nresults. Finally, incorporating ADE and FDE loss further improved performance, as shown in Table\\n1. Although the DIM method resulted in the lowest Negative Log Likelihood(NLL), it was not as\\ncompetitive as other models.

Our research reveals that the\\nincorporation of whale song patterns into trance music can lead to unexpected\\noutcomes, including improved focus, enhanced problem-solving skills, and even\\npurported instances of telepathic communication among participants. Furthermore,\\nwe discovered that the most effective GAN architectures for this task are those\\nthat incorporate elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry, allowing for the\\ncreation of intricate, self-similar patterns that resonate with the human brain’s innate\\npropensity for recognizing and responding to natural harmonics. Interestingly, our\\nexperiments also showed that the generated music can have a profound impact\\non plant growth, with subjects exposed to the hypnotic trance music exhibiting a\\nsignificant increase in photosynthetic activity and floral bloom intensity. While the\\nunderlying mechanisms behind these phenomena are not yet fully understood, our\\nfindings suggest that the application of GANs to whale song translation may have\\nfar-reaching implications for fields beyond music and psychoacoustics, including\\nbiology, ecology, and even paranormal research.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe realm of psychoacoustics has long been fascinated by the intricate patterns and melodies found in\\nwhale songs, with many researchers hypothesizing that these vocalizations hold the key to unlocking\\nnew avenues of human creativity. Recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have\\nenabled the development of novel machine learning architectures capable of translating these complex\\nacoustic patterns into hypnotic trance music. This innovative approach not only pushes the boundaries\\nof audio synthesis but also raises fundamental questions about the cognitive and emotional responses\\nof humans to such translated music. By leveraging the psychoacoustic properties of whale songs,\\nit is possible to create trance-inducing soundscapes that can purportedly enhance human creativity,\\nimprove focus, and even facilitate access to previously unexplored states of consciousness.\\nOne of the more unconventional approaches to this line of research involves the use of whale song\\ntranslations as a form of sonic catalyst for inducing lucid dreaming. Proponents of this method claim\\nthat the exposure to hypnotic trance music generated from whale songs can increase the likelihood of\\nentering a lucid dream state, thereby allowing individuals to tap into the vast, uncharted territories of\\ntheir subconscious mind. While this notion may seem far-fetched, preliminary results suggest that\\nthe unique acoustic features of whale songs, such as their low-frequency rumbles and high-pitched\\nclicks, can indeed have a profound impact on the human brain’s ability to access and navigate the\\nrealm of the subconscious.Furthermore, researchers have also begun to explore the potential applications of whale song-based\\ntrance music in the context of cognitive enhancement and mental wellness. It is purported that the\\nlistening to such music can reduce stress levels, improve mood, and even enhance cognitive function\\nin individuals with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although these claims are largely\\nanecdotal and in need of rigorous scientific validation, they nonetheless highlight the vast, unexplored\\npotential of whale song-based music therapy and its possible applications in the fields of psychology,\\nneuroscience, and education.\\nIn a somewhat bizarre twist, some researchers have also started investigating the potential for whale\\nsong translations to be used as a form of interspecies communication. The idea is that by generating\\nhypnotic trance music from whale songs, humans may be able to establish a deeper, more empathetic\\nconnection with these marine mammals, potentially even facilitating a form of cross-species creative\\ncollaboration. While this concept may seem like the stuff of science fiction, it is nonetheless an\\nintriguing area of study that challenges our current understanding of the boundaries between human\\nand animal creativity. As such, it is an area that warrants further exploration and research, particularly\\nin the context of developing more sophisticated and humane approaches to animal-human interaction.\\nThe development of GANs capable of translating whale songs into hypnotic trance music has also led\\nto a number of unexpected discoveries, including the finding that certain types of whale songs appear\\nto be more conducive to inducing creative states in humans than others. For example, the songs of the\\nhumpback whale, with their complex, hierarchical structures and hauntingly beautiful melodies, seem\\nto be particularly well-suited for generating trance-inducing music that can facilitate deep states of\\nrelaxation and creativity. In contrast, the songs of the sperm whale, with their low-frequency clicks\\nand whistles, appear to be more effective at inducing states of high focus and concentration, making\\nthem potentially useful for applications such as cognitive enhancement and mental performance\\noptimization. These findings, while preliminary and in need of further validation, highlight the vast,\\nunexplored potential of whale song-based music therapy and its possible applications in a wide range\\nof fields, from psychology and neuroscience to education and the arts.\\n2 Related Work\\nRecent advancements in generative modeling have paved the way for innovative applications of\\nartificial intelligence in audio processing, including the translation of non-human sounds into music.\\nThe concept of using whale songs as a foundation for hypnotic trance music is rooted in the idea\\nthat the psychoacoustic properties of these sounds can have a profound impact on human cognition\\nand creativity. Research has shown that the frequency range and rhythmic patterns present in whale\\nsongs can induce a state of deep relaxation and heightened focus, making them an ideal candidate for\\ntranslation into hypnotic trance music.\\nOne approach to achieving this translation involves the use of Generative Adversarial Networks\\n(GANs), which have been successfully employed in various audio processing tasks, including music\\ngeneration and style transfer. By training a GAN on a dataset of whale songs and hypnotic trance\\nmusic, it is possible to learn a mapping between the two domains, allowing for the generation of novel\\ntrance music tracks that capture the essence of the original whale songs. However, this approach\\nis not without its challenges, as the complexity and nuance of whale songs can make it difficult to\\npreserve their psychoacoustic properties during the translation process.\\nInterestingly, some researchers have explored the use of unconventional techniques, such as analyzing\\nthe brain waves of individuals listening to whale songs and using this data to inform the generation\\nof hypnotic trance music. This approach, known as \"neurosonic resonance,\" involves measuring\\nthe neural activity of listeners and using this information to create music that is tailored to their\\nspecific brain wave patterns. While this method may seem unorthodox, it has been shown to produce\\nremarkable results, with listeners reporting heightened states of relaxation and focus when exposed\\nto music generated using this technique.\\nIn another unexpected twist, some studies have investigated the use of whale songs as a form of \"sonic\\nfertilizer\" to enhance the creativity of plants. By playing whale songs to plants during their growth\\ncycle, researchers have observed significant increases in plant growth and productivity, suggesting\\nthat the psychoacoustic properties of these sounds may have a profound impact on the natural world.\\nWhile this finding may seem unrelated to the task of translating whale songs into hypnotic trance\\n2music, it highlights the vast and unexplored potential of non-human sounds to influence human\\ncognition and creativity.\\nFurthermore, the use of GANs in audio processing has also been explored in the context of \"audio\\nhallucinations,\" where the network is trained to generate sounds that are not present in the original\\naudio signal. This approach has been used to create novel and eerie soundscapes that blur the line\\nbetween reality and fantasy, raising important questions about the nature of sound and perception.\\nBy applying this technique to the translation of whale songs into hypnotic trance music, it may\\nbe possible to create sounds that are not only mesmerizing but also challenge our fundamental\\nunderstanding of the audio world.\\nIn addition to these approaches, researchers have also explored the use of whale songs as a form\\nof \"acoustic archaeology,\" where the sounds are used to uncover hidden patterns and structures\\nin the natural world. By analyzing the frequency content and rhythmic patterns present in whale\\nsongs, scientists have been able to identify previously unknown patterns and relationships in the\\nocean’s ecosystem, highlighting the vast and unexplored potential of non-human sounds to inform our\\nunderstanding of the world. While this application may seem far removed from the task of translating\\nwhale songs into hypnotic trance music, it underscores the profound impact that these sounds can\\nhave on our perception and understanding of reality.\\n3 Methodology\\nTo develop an effective framework for translating whale song into hypnotic trance music, we employed\\na multi-stage methodology that integrated psychoacoustic analysis, Generative Adversarial Network\\n(GAN) architecture, and an innovative approach to auditory entrainment. Initially, we collected a\\ncomprehensive dataset of whale songs from various species, which were then subjected to a rigorous\\nprocess of spectral analysis to identify the underlying patterns and frequencies that contribute to their\\nhypnotic properties. This involved decomposing the whale songs into their constituent components,\\nincluding low-frequency rumbles, mid-frequency moans, and high-frequency clicks, to create a\\nspectral fingerprint for each species.\\nThe psychoacoustic analysis revealed that the hypnotic effects of whale songs can be attributed to\\nthe presence of specific frequency ranges, particularly in the delta and theta frequency bands, which\\nare known to induce states of deep relaxation and heightened creativity. To replicate these effects in\\nhypnotic trance music, we designed a custom GAN architecture that incorporated a generator network\\ntrained on a dataset of trance music tracks, and a discriminator network trained on a dataset of whale\\nsongs. The generator network was tasked with producing musical compositions that mimicked the\\nspectral properties of whale songs, while the discriminator network evaluated the generated music\\nbased on its similarity to the original whale songs.\\nIn a bizarre twist, we discovered that the GAN architecture was capable of producing more convincing\\nresults when the training data was augmented with a dataset of ambient noises recorded from the\\nvicinity of a haunted mansion. The exact mechanism behind this phenomenon is unclear, but it\\nappears that the introduction of paranormal energy into the training process imbued the generated\\nmusic with an otherworldly quality that was not only hypnotic but also seemingly prophetic. To\\nfurther enhance the creative potential of the generated music, we incorporated an innovative approach\\nto auditory entrainment, which involved embedding subtle patterns of binaural beats and isochronic\\ntones into the musical compositions. These patterns were designed to stimulate specific regions of\\nthe brain associated with creativity, intuition, and higher states of consciousness.\\nThe GAN architecture was also modified to incorporate a feedback loop that allowed the generator\\nnetwork to adapt to the listener’s brainwave activity in real-time, using a non-invasive brain-computer\\ninterface to monitor the listener’s neural responses to the music. This feedback loop enabled the\\ngenerator network to fine-tune the musical compositions to induce optimal states of relaxation, focus,\\nand creativity, effectively creating a personalized hypnotic trance music experience for each listener.\\nWhile the results of this approach were undeniably impressive, they also raised important questions\\nabout the potential risks and benefits of using GANs to manipulate human brainwave activity, and the\\nneed for further research into the ethical implications of this technology.\\n34 Experiments\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed GAN architecture in translating whale song into\\nhypnotic trance music, we conducted a series of experiments involving a diverse range of participants,\\nincluding professional musicians, music therapists, and individuals with no prior musical experience.\\nThe experiments were designed to assess the impact of the generated music on human creativity, with\\na particular focus on the psychoacoustic properties of the translated songs.\\nWe began by collecting a dataset of whale songs from various species, including humpback, orca, and\\nsperm whales, which were then used to train our GAN model. The model consisted of a generator\\nnetwork that took the whale song as input and produced a corresponding hypnotic trance music track,\\nand a discriminator network that evaluated the generated track and provided feedback to the generator.\\nWe trained the model using a combination of adversarial loss and a novel \"trance-inducing\" loss\\nfunction, which was designed to maximize the hypnotic potential of the generated music.\\nIn addition to the standard metrics used to evaluate GAN performance, such as inception score and\\nFréchet inception distance, we also used a custom \"trance-meter\" device to measure the hypnotic\\neffect of the generated music on human subjects. The trance-meter consisted of a wearable device\\nthat tracked the subject’s brain activity, heart rate, and skin conductivity while listening to the music,\\nand provided a quantitative score of the subject’s level of trance.\\nOne of the most surprising results of our experiments was the discovery that the generated music\\nhad a profound effect on the creativity of participants who were given a task to create a piece of\\nartwork while listening to the music. Specifically, we found that participants who listened to the\\nmusic generated by our GAN model produced artwork that was significantly more surreal and abstract\\nthan those who listened to a control track of white noise. Furthermore, when we asked participants to\\ndescribe their creative process, many reported experiencing vivid dreams and visions while listening\\nto the music, which they claimed inspired their artwork.\\nIn an attempt to further understand the relationship between the generated music and human creativity,\\nwe conducted a series of experiments involving the use of psychedelic substances, including LSD and\\npsilocybin. We found that participants who were under the influence of these substances and listened\\nto the generated music produced artwork that was even more surreal and abstract than those who\\nwere not under the influence. However, when we tried to replicate these results using a control group\\nof participants who were given a placebo, we found that the placebo group actually produced artwork\\nthat was more creative and innovative than the group that was under the influence of the psychedelic\\nsubstances. This unexpected result led us to conclude that the generated music may have a synergistic\\neffect with the psychedelic substances, and that the placebo effect may be a more significant factor in\\nenhancing human creativity than previously thought.\\nTo further explore the properties of the generated music, we created a table to compare the trance-\\ninducing scores of different whale species and their corresponding translated music tracks.\\nTable 1: Trance-inducing scores of different whale species and their corresponding translated music\\ntracks\\nWhale Species Trance-inducing Score Music Track Length Surrealism Score\\nHumpback Whale 0.85 10:45 0.92\\nOrca Whale 0.78 8:21 0.85\\nSperm Whale 0.92 12:10 0.95\\nThe results of our experiments demonstrate the potential of our proposed GAN architecture in\\ngenerating hypnotic trance music that can have a profound impact on human creativity. However, the\\nunexpected results of our experiments also highlight the need for further research into the relationship\\nbetween the generated music, psychedelic substances, and the human creative process. Future studies\\nshould aim to replicate our results and explore the potential applications of our GAN model in fields\\nsuch as music therapy, art therapy, and cognitive psychology.\\n45 Results\\nOur experiments yielded a plethora of intriguing results, with the GAN-based model demonstrating\\na remarkable ability to translate whale song into hypnotic trance music that resonated with human\\nlisteners on a profound level. The psychoacoustic properties of the generated music were found to\\nhave a significant impact on the creative output of human subjects, with many reporting enhanced\\nimagination and innovative thinking after exposure to the translated whale songs.\\nOne of the most unexpected findings was the discovery that the model’s performance was significantly\\nimproved when the training data was supplemented with recordings of dolphin clicks and elephant\\nrumblings. This seemingly bizarre approach resulted in a 37\\nThe results of our experiments are summarized in the following table:\\nTable 2: Effect of supplemental training data on model performance\\nTraining Data Hypnotic Score Creative Output Nuance Capture\\nWhale Song Only 0.62 0.45 0.31\\nWhale Song + Dolphin Clicks 0.81 0.63 0.51\\nWhale Song + Elephant Rummings 0.75 0.59 0.42\\nWhale Song + Dolphin Clicks + Elephant Rummings 0.92 0.81 0.67\\nIn addition to the quantitative results, our study also uncovered some fascinating qualitative insights.\\nMany human subjects reported experiencing vivid, ocean-themed dreams after listening to the\\ngenerated music, with some even claiming to have gained a deeper understanding of the emotional\\nlives of whales. While these findings are admittedly anecdotal, they do suggest that the model’s\\noutput is having a profound impact on human consciousness, one that extends far beyond the realm\\nof mere entertainment.\\nOne potential explanation for these results is that the model is somehow tapping into the collective\\nunconscious, leveraging the primal, emotional resonance of whale song to access deep-seated creative\\npotential within the human psyche. This idea is supported by the fact that many of the generated\\nmusic pieces exhibit a strange, otherworldly quality, as if they are emanating from a realm beyond\\nthe boundaries of human experience. While this hypothesis is certainly speculative, it does highlight\\nthe vast, uncharted territories that await exploration at the intersection of artificial intelligence,\\npsychoacoustics, and human creativity.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, our research team also discovered that the model’s performance was\\ninfluenced by the phase of the moon, with the generated music exhibiting a more \"lunar\" quality during\\nfull moon periods.

The psychoacoustic approach employed in this study has yielded intriguing results,\\nhighlighting the complex relationships between auditory perception, emotional response, and creative\\ncognition. Notably, the incorporation of whale song as a stimulus has led to the development of\\nnovel trance music patterns that defy conventional music theory, sparking debates about the role of\\nunconventional sound sources in shaping human creativity.\\nOne unexpected finding was the discovery that the generated trance music exhibited a peculiar\\nresonance with the brain’s default mode network, which is typically associated with introspection\\nand self-reflection. This resonance was found to induce a state of deep relaxation in listeners, often\\naccompanied by vivid visualizations and enhanced imagination. While the underlying mechanisms are\\n5not yet fully understood, this phenomenon has led us to propose the concept of \"sonic entrainment,\"\\nwhere the rhythmic patterns and frequency modulations in the translated whale song somehow\\nsynchronize with the brain’s intrinsic oscillations, facilitating a heightened state of creative receptivity.\\nFurthermore, our research has also explored the possibility of using the generated trance music as a\\ncatalyst for creative problem-solving. In a series of experiments, participants were asked to listen\\nto the translated whale song while engaging in various creative tasks, such as painting, writing,\\nor composing music. The results showed a significant increase in creative output and innovation,\\nwith many participants reporting a sense of increased inspiration and flow. However, a bizarre side\\neffect was observed, where some participants began to incorporate whale-like vocalizations into their\\ncreative work, blurring the lines between human and animal expression. This unexpected tangent has\\nraised questions about the potential for interspecies creative collaboration and the role of biomimicry\\nin artistic expression.\\nIn addition, our study has touched upon the idea that the translated whale song may possess inherent\\ntherapeutic properties, capable of alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression. While this claim\\nmay seem far-fetched, our preliminary findings suggest that the hypnotic trance music generated by\\nthe GANs can indeed have a profound impact on mental well-being, possibly due to its ability to\\nmodulate the brain’s stress response and promote relaxation. To further investigate this claim, we\\npropose the development of a new field of research, dubbed \"cetacean sound therapy,\" which would\\nexplore the therapeutic potential of whale song and other marine animal vocalizations.\\nIn retrospect, our research has not only demonstrated the feasibility of using GANs to translate\\nwhale song into hypnotic trance music but has also opened up new avenues for interdisciplinary\\nresearch, spanning psychoacoustics, creativity studies, and marine biology. As we continue to push\\nthe boundaries of this innovative approach, we may uncover even more surprising and counterintuitive\\nresults, challenging our understanding of the complex relationships between sound, creativity, and\\nthe human experience. Ultimately, the true potential of this research lies in its ability to inspire new\\nforms of artistic expression, foster creative collaboration between humans and animals, and perhaps\\neven unlock the secrets of the ocean’s most enigmatic creatures.\\n6'},\n",

A lack of high-quality data, combined with\\ninsufficient collaboration between academic research and industry applications,\\nhas hindered advancements in this area. This paper outlines a comprehensive\\nworkshop and challenge centered on physically informed 3D food reconstruction,\\nleveraging recent progress in 3D reconstruction technologies. The central objective\\nof this challenge is to create volume-accurate 3D models of food using 2D images,\\nwith a visible checkerboard serving as a critical size reference. Participants were\\nassigned the task of building 3D models for 20 distinct food items, each presenting\\nvarying degrees of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard. The easy category offers\\n200 images, the medium provides 30, and the hard level includes only a single\\nimage to facilitate the reconstruction process. During the final evaluation stage, 16\\nteams presented their results. The methodologies developed during this challenge\\nhave yielded encouraging outcomes in 3D food reconstruction, demonstrating\\nconsiderable potential for enhancing portion estimation in dietary evaluations and\\nnutritional tracking.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe merging of computer vision with the culinary domain has unveiled new possibilities in dietary\\noversight and nutritional evaluation. The 3D Food Modeling Workshop Challenge signifies a notable\\nadvancement in this domain, responding to the escalating demand for precise and adaptable techniques\\nfor estimating food portions and monitoring nutritional consumption. These technological solutions\\nare essential for encouraging beneficial eating patterns and addressing health issues related to diet.\\nThis initiative aims to close the divide between current methodologies and practical needs by\\nconcentrating on the development of accurate 3D models of food items from multi-view and single-\\nview image data. The challenge promotes the creation of novel methods capable of managing the\\nintricacies of food forms, textures, and variations in lighting, all while adhering to the practical\\nlimitations inherent in real-world dietary assessment situations.\\nConventional methods for diet assessment, like 24-Hour Recall or Food Frequency Questionnaires\\n(FFQ), frequently depend on manual data entry, which can be imprecise and difficult to manage.\\nAdditionally, the lack of 3D data in 2D RGB food images poses significant hurdles for methods\\nthat rely on regression to estimate food portions directly from images of eating occasions. By\\nmaking progress in 3D reconstruction techniques for food, the aim is to provide tools for nutritional\\nassessment that are more accurate and easier to use. This technology holds the potential to enhance\\nthe way food experiences are shared and could significantly influence areas such as nutritional science\\nand public health initiatives.\\nParticipants were tasked with creating 3D models of 20 different food items from 2D images,\\nsimulating a scenario where a smartphone equipped with a depth-sensing camera is employed for\\ndietary recording and nutritional oversight. The challenge was divided into three levels of complexity:\\n.The easy level provided approximately 200 frames uniformly sampled from a video, the medium level\\noffered about 30 images, and the hard level presented participants with just one monocular top-view\\nimage. This arrangement was intended to assess the resilience and adaptability of the suggested\\nsolutions under various real-world conditions. One of the main aspects of the challenge involves the\\nuse of a visible checkerboard as a tangible benchmark, coupled with the inclusion of depth images\\nfor each frame of the video, thereby ensuring the generated 3D models retain precise real-world\\nmeasurements for estimating portion sizes.\\n2 Related Work\\nEstimating food portions is a crucial part of image-based dietary assessment, with the objective of\\ndetermining the volume, energy content, or macronutrient breakdown directly from images of meals.\\nUnlike the extensively researched area of food recognition, determining food portions presents a\\ndistinct difficulty because of the lack of 3D data and physical benchmarks, which are necessary\\nfor precisely deducing the actual sizes of food portions. Specifically, accurately estimating portion\\nsizes requires an understanding of the volume and density of the food, aspects that cannot be easily\\ndetermined from a two-dimensional image, which highlights the need for advanced methodologies\\nand technologies to address this issue. Current methods for estimating food portions are classified\\ninto four primary categories.\\nStereo-Based Approaches. These techniques depend on multiple frames to deduce the 3D con-\\nfiguration of food items. For instance, some methods calculate food volume through multi-view\\nstereo reconstruction based on epipolar geometry, while others use a two-view dense reconstruction\\napproach. Another technique, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), is employed for\\ncontinuous, real-time estimation of food volume. However, the need for multiple images limits the\\npracticality of these methods in real-world situations.\\nModel-Based Approach. This approach uses predefined shapes and templates to estimate the target\\nvolume. Some methods assign specific templates to foods from a reference set and make adjustments\\nbased on physical cues to gauge the size and position of the food. A similar approach that matches\\ntemplates is employed to estimate food volume from just one image. However, these methods struggle\\nto accommodate foods with shapes that do not conform to the established templates.\\nDepth Camera-Based Approach. This method utilizes depth cameras to create maps that indicate\\nthe distance from the camera to the food in the picture. The depth map is then used to create a voxel\\nrepresentation of the image, which aids in estimating the food’s volume. The primary drawbacks are\\nthe need for high-quality depth maps and the additional processing steps required for depth sensors\\nused by consumers.\\nDeep Learning Approach. Techniques based on neural networks use the vast amount of image data\\navailable to train sophisticated networks for estimating food portions. Some use regression networks\\nto estimate the caloric value of food from a single image or from an \"Energy Distribution Map\" that\\ncorrelates the input image with the energy distribution of the foods shown. Others use regression\\nnetworks trained on images and depth maps to deduce the energy, mass, and macronutrients of the\\nfood in the image. These methods require extensive data for training and are generally not transparent.\\nTheir performance can significantly decline if the input test image deviates substantially from the\\ntraining data.\\nDespite the progress these methods have made in estimating food portions, they each have limitations\\nthat restrict their broad use and precision in practical scenarios. Methods based on stereo are not\\nsuitable for single-image inputs, those based on models have difficulty with a variety of food shapes,\\napproaches using depth cameras necessitate specialized equipment, and deep learning methods are not\\neasily interpretable and have difficulty with samples that are different from those they were trained on.\\nTo tackle these issues, 3D reconstruction provides a viable solution by offering thorough spatial data,\\naccommodating different food shapes, possibly functioning with just one image, presenting results\\nthat are visually understandable, and facilitating a uniform method for estimating food portions. These\\nbenefits were the driving force behind the organization of the 3D Food Reconstruction challenge,\\nwhich seeks to surmount the current limitations and create techniques for food portion estimation\\nthat are more accurate, user-friendly, and broadly applicable, thereby making a significant impact on\\nnutritional assessment and dietary monitoring.\\n23 Datasets and Evaluation Pipeline\\n3.1 Dataset Description\\nThe dataset for the 3D Food Modeling Challenge includes 20 carefully chosen food items, each\\nhaving been scanned with a 3D scanner and also captured on video. To ensure the reconstructed 3D\\nmodels accurately represent size, each food item was captured alongside a checkerboard and pattern\\nmat, which provide a physical reference for scaling. The challenge is segmented into three levels of\\ndifficulty, based on the number of 2D images provided for reconstruction:\\n• Easy: Roughly 200 images taken from video.\\n• Medium: 30 images.\\n• Hard: A single top-down image.\\nTable 1: 3D Food Modeling Challenge Data Details\\nObject Index Food Item Difficulty Level Number of Frames\\n1 Strawberry Easy 199\\n2 Cinnamon bun Easy 200\\n3 Pork rib Easy 200\\n4 Corn Easy 200\\n5 French toast Easy 200\\n6 Sandwich Easy 200\\n7 Burger Easy 200\\n8 Cake Easy 200\\n9 Blueberry muffin Medium 30\\n10 Banana Medium 30\\n11 Salmon Medium 30\\n12 Steak Medium 30\\n13 Burrito Medium 30\\n14 Hotdog Medium 30\\n15 Chicken nugget Medium 30\\n16 Everything bagel Hard 1\\n17 Croissant Hard 1\\n18 Shrimp Hard 1\\n19 Waffle Hard 1\\n20 Pizza Hard 1\\n3.2 Evaluation Pipeline\\nThe evaluation is divided into two stages, focusing on the accuracy of the reconstructed 3D models in\\nterms of their form (3D structure) and portion size (volume).\\n3.2.1 Phase-I: Volume Accuracy\\nIn the first phase, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used as the metric to evaluate the\\naccuracy of portion size. The calculation for MAPE is as follows:\\nMAPE = 1\\nn\\nnX\\ni=1\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\nAi − Fi\\nAi\\n\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c\\x0c × 100%\\nwhere Ai represents the actual volume (in milliliters) of the i-th food item, as determined from the\\nscanned 3D mesh, and Fi is the volume calculated from the reconstructed 3D mesh.\\n33.2.2 Phase-II: Shape Accuracy\\nTeams that perform well in Phase-I are asked to provide full 3D mesh files for each food item. This\\nphase includes multiple steps to guarantee both accuracy and fairness:\\n1. Model Verification: Submitted models are checked against the final submissions from\\nPhase-I to ensure they are consistent. Visual inspections are also conducted to prevent any\\nviolations of the rules, such as submitting basic shapes (like spheres) rather than detailed\\nreconstructions.\\n2. Model Alignment : Participants are given the true 3D models and the script used for\\ncalculating the final Chamfer distance. They must align their models with these true models\\nand create a transformation matrix for each item submitted. The ultimate Chamfer distance\\nscore is then calculated using the submitted models and their corresponding transformation\\nmatrices.\\n3. Chamfer Distance Calculation: The accuracy of the shape is assessed using the Chamfer\\ndistance. For two sets of points, X and Y , the Chamfer distance is computed as follows:\\ndCD(X, Y) = 1\\n|X|\\nX\\nx∈X\\nmin\\ny∈Y\\n∥x − y∥2\\n2 + 1\\n|Y |\\nX\\ny∈Y\\nmin\\nx∈X\\n∥x − y∥2\\n2\\nThis metric offers a thorough assessment of how closely the reconstructed 3D models match the\\nactual models. The ultimate ranking is determined by merging the scores from both Phase-I (accuracy\\nof volume) and Phase-II (accuracy of shape). It should be noted that after evaluating Phase-I, some\\nissues with the data quality for object 12 (steak) and object 15 (chicken nugget) were found. To\\nmaintain the competition’s quality and fairness, these two items have been removed from the final\\noverall evaluation.\\n4 First Place Team - VolETA\\n4.1 Methodology\\nThe team’s research employs multi-view reconstruction to generate detailed food meshes and accu-\\nrately determine food volumes.\\n4.1.1 Overview\\nThe team’s method integrates computer vision and deep learning to accurately estimate food volume\\nfrom RGBD images and masks. Keyframe selection, supported by perceptual hashing and blur\\ndetection, ensures data quality. The estimation of camera poses and object segmentation establishes\\nthe basis for neural surface reconstruction, resulting in detailed meshes for volume estimation.\\nRefinement processes, such as removing isolated parts and adjusting the scaling factor, improve\\naccuracy.\\n4.1.2 The Team’s Proposal: VolETA\\nThe team starts their process by obtaining input data, specifically RGBD images and their correspond-\\ning food object masks. These RGBD images are denoted as ID = {ID\\ni }n\\ni=1, where n is the total\\nnumber of frames, providing the necessary depth information alongside the RGB images. The food\\nobject masks, denoted as {MF\\ni }n\\ni=1, help identify the regions of interest within these images.\\nNext, the team proceeds with keyframe selection. From the set {ID\\ni }n\\ni=1, keyframes {IK\\nj }k\\nj=1 ⊆\\n{ID\\ni }n\\ni=1 are selected. The team implements a method to detect and remove duplicates and blurry\\nimages to ensure high-quality frames. This involves applying the Gaussian blurring kernel followed\\nby the fast Fourier transform method. Near-Image Similarity employs a perceptual hashing and\\nhamming distance thresholding to detect similar images and keep overlapping. The duplicates and\\nblurry images are excluded from the selection process to maintain data integrity and accuracy.\\nUsing the selected keyframes {IK\\nj }k\\nj=1, the team estimates the camera poses through a Structure\\nfrom Motion approach (i.e., extracting features using a feature detection method, matching them\\n4using a matching algorithm, and refining them). The outputs are the set of camera poses {Cj}k\\nj=1,\\nwhich are crucial for spatial understanding of the scene.\\nIn parallel, the team utilizes a segmentation algorithm for reference object segmentation. This\\nalgorithm segments the reference object with a user-provided segmentation prompt (i.e., user click),\\nproducing a reference object mask MR for each keyframe. This mask is a foundation for tracking the\\nreference object across all frames. The team then applies a memory tracking method, which extends\\nthe reference object mask MR to all frames, resulting in a comprehensive set of reference object\\nmasks {MR\\ni }n\\ni=1. This ensures consistency in reference object identification throughout the dataset.\\nTo create RGBA images, the team combines the RGB images, reference object masks{MR\\ni }n\\ni=1, and\\nfood object masks {MF\\ni }n\\ni=1. This step, denoted as {IR\\ni }n\\ni=1, integrates the various data sources into\\na unified format suitable for further processing.\\nThe team converts the RGBA images {IR\\ni }n\\ni=1 and camera poses {Cj}k\\nj=1 into meaningful metadata\\nand modeled data Dm. This transformation facilitates the accurate reconstruction of the scene.\\nThe modeled data Dm is then input into a neural surface reconstruction algorithm for mesh recon-\\nstruction. This algorithm generates colorful meshes {Rf , Rr} for the reference and food objects,\\nproviding detailed 3D representations of the scene components. The team applies the \"Remove\\nIsolated Pieces\" technique to refine the reconstructed meshes. Given that the scenes contain only\\none food item, the team sets the diameter threshold to 5% of the mesh size. This method deletes\\nisolated connected components whose diameter is less than or equal to this 5% threshold, resulting in\\na cleaned mesh {RCf , RCr}. This step ensures that only significant and relevant parts of the mesh\\nare retained.\\nThe team manually identifies an initial scaling factorS using the reference mesh via a mesh processing\\ntool for scaling factor identification. This factor is then fine-tuned Sf using depth information and\\nfood and reference masks, ensuring accurate scaling relative to real-world dimensions. Finally, the\\nfine-tuned scaling factor Sf is applied to the cleaned food mesh RCf , producing the final scaled\\nfood mesh RFf . This step culminates in an accurately scaled 3D representation of the food object,\\nenabling precise volume estimation.\\n4.1.3 Detecting the scaling factor\\nGenerally, 3D reconstruction methods generate unitless meshes (i.e., no physical scale) by default.\\nTo overcome this limitation, the team manually identifies the scaling factor by measuring the distance\\nfor each block for the reference object mesh. Next, the team takes the average of all blocks lengths\\nlavg, while the actual real-world length is constant lreal = 0.012 in meter. Furthermore, the team\\napplies the scaling factor S = lreal/lavg on the clean food mesh RCf , producing the final scaled\\nfood mesh RFf in meter.\\nThe team leverages depth information alongside food and reference object masks to validate the\\nscaling factors. The team’s method for assessing food size entails utilizing overhead RGB images\\nfor each scene. Initially, the team determines the pixel-per-unit (PPU) ratio (in meters) using the\\nreference object. Subsequently, the team extracts the food width (fw) and length (fl) employing a\\nfood object mask. To ascertain the food height (fh), the team follows a two-step process. Firstly, the\\nteam conducts binary image segmentation using the overhead depth and reference images, yielding a\\nsegmented depth image for the reference object. The team then calculates the average depth utilizing\\nthe segmented reference object depth (dr). Similarly, employing binary image segmentation with an\\noverhead food object mask and depth image, the team computes the average depth for the segmented\\nfood depth image (df). Finally, the estimated food height fh is computed as the absolute difference\\nbetween dr and df. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of the scaling factor S, the team computes\\nthe food bounding box volume ((fw × fl × fh) × PPU). The team evaluates if the scaling factor S\\ngenerates a food volume close to this potential volume, resulting in Sfine .\\nFor one-shot 3D reconstruction, the team leverages a single view reconstruction method for recon-\\nstructing a 3D from a single RGBA view input after applying binary image segmentation on both\\nfood RGB and mask. Next, the team removes isolated pieces from the generated mesh. After that, the\\nteam reuses the scaling factor S, which is closer to the potential volume of the clean mesh.\\n54.2 Experimental Results\\n4.2.1 Implementation settings\\nThe experiments were conducted using two GPUs: a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 12GB of memory\\nand an RTX 3060 with 6GB of memory. For near-image similarity detection, the Hamming distance\\nwas set to 12. To identify blurry images, even numbers within the range of [0...30] were used as the\\nGaussian kernel radius. In the process of removing isolated pieces, a diameter threshold of 5% was\\napplied. Neural surface reconstruction involved 15,000 iterations, with a mesh resolution of 512x512.\\nThe unit cube parameters were set with an \"aabb scale\" of 1, \"scale\" at 0.15, and \"offset\" at [0.5, 0.5,\\n0.5] for each food scene.\\n4.2.2 VolETA Results\\nThe team extensively validated their approach on the challenge dataset and compared their results with\\nground truth meshes using MAPE and Chamfer distance metrics. More Briefly, the team leverages\\ntheir approach for each food scene separately. A one-shot food volume estimation approach is applied\\nif the number of keyframes k equals 1. Otherwise, a few-shot food volume estimation is applied. The\\nteam’s keyframe selection process chooses 34.8% of total frames for the rest of the pipeline, where it\\nshows the minimum frames with the highest information.\\nTable 2: List of Extracted Information Using RGBD and Masks\\nLevel Id Label Sf PPU Rw × Rl fw × fl × fh V olume (cm3)\\nEasy\\n1 strawberry 0.08955 0.01786 320 × 360 238 × 257 × 2.353 45.91\\n2 cinnamon bun 0.10435 0.02347 236 × 274 363 × 419 × 2.353 197.07\\n3 pork rib 0.10435 0.02381 246 × 270 435 × 778 × 1.176 225.79\\n4 corn 0.08824 0.01897 291 × 339 262 × 976 × 2.353 216.45\\n5 french toast 0.10345 0.02202 266 × 292 530 × 581 × 2.53 377.66\\n6 sandwich 0.12766 0.02426 230 × 265 294 × 431 × 2.353 175.52\\n7 burger 0.10435 0.02435 208 × 264 378 × 400 × 2.353 211.03\\n8 cake 0.12766 0.02143 256 × 300 298 × 310 × 4.706 199.69\\nMedium\\n9 blueberry muffin 0.08759 0.01801 291 × 357 441 × 443 × 2.353 149.12\\n10 banana 0.08759 0.01705 315 × 377 446 × 857 × 1.176 130.80\\n11 salmon 0.10435 0.02390 242 × 269 201 × 303 × 1.176 40.94\\n13 burrito 0.10345 0.02372 244 × 271 251 × 917 × 2.353 304.87\\n14 frankfurt sandwich 0.10345 0.02115 266 × 304 400 × 1022 × 2.353 430.29\\nHard\\n16 everything bagel 0.08759 0.01747 306 × 368 458 × 484 × 1.176 79.61\\n17 croissant 0.12766 0.01751 319 × 367 395 × 695 × 2.176 183.39\\n18 shrimp 0.08759 0.02021 249 × 318 186 × 195 × 0.987 14.64\\n19 waffle 0.01034 0.01902 294 × 338 465 × 537 × 0.8 72.29\\n20 pizza 0.01034 0.01913 292 × 336 442 × 651 × 1.176 123.97\\nAfter generating the scaled meshes, the team calculates the volumes and Chamfer distance with and\\nwithout transformation metrics.

For any image imgk\\nand its extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the team first performs a threshold-based corner detection with\\nthe threshold set to 240. This allows them to obtain the pixel coordinates of all detected corners.\\nSubsequently, using the intrinsic parameters k and the extrinsic parameters [R|t]k, the point cloud is\\nprojected onto the image plane. Based on the pixel coordinates of the corners, the team can identify\\nthe closest point coordinates Pk\\ni for each corner, where i represents the index of the corner. Thus,\\nthey can calculate the distance between any two corners as follows:\\nDij = (Pk\\ni − Pk\\nj )2 ∀i ̸= j\\nTo determine the final computed length of each checkerboard square in image k, the team takes the\\nminimum value of each row of the matrix Dk (excluding the diagonal) to form the vector dk. The\\nmedian of this vector is then used. The final scale calculation formula is given by the following\\nequation, where 0.012 represents the known length of each square (1.2 cm):\\nscale = 0.012\\nmed(dk)\\n5.1.2 3D Reconstruction\\nConsidering the differences in input viewpoints, the team utilizes two pipelines to process the first\\nfifteen objects and the last five single view objects.\\nFor the first fifteen objects, the team uses a Structure from Motion algorithm to estimate the poses\\nand segment the food using the provided segment masks in the dataset. Then, they apply advanced\\nmulti-view 3D reconstruction methods to reconstruct the segmented food. In practice, the team\\nemploys three different reconstruction methods. They select the best reconstruction results from these\\nmethods and extract the mesh from the reconstructed model. Next, they scale the extracted mesh\\nusing the estimated scale factor. Finally, they apply some optimization techniques to obtain a refined\\nmesh.\\n7For the last five single-view objects, the team experiments with several single-view reconstruction\\nmethods. They choose a specific method to obtain a 3D food model consistent with the distribution\\nof the input image. In practice, they use the intrinsic camera parameters from the fifteenth object\\nand employ an optimization method based on reprojection error to refine the extrinsic parameters\\nof the single camera. However, due to the limitations of single-view reconstruction, the team needs\\nto incorporate depth information from the dataset and the checkerboard in the monocular image to\\ndetermine the size of the extracted mesh. Finally, they apply optimization techniques to obtain a\\nrefined mesh.\\n5.1.3 Mesh refinement\\nIn the 3D Reconstruction phase, the team observes that the model’s results often suffer from low\\nquality due to the presence of holes on the object surface and substantial noise.\\nTo address the holes, the team employs an optimization method based on computational geometry.\\nFor surface noise, they utilize Laplacian Smoothing for mesh smoothing operations. The Laplacian\\nSmoothing method works by adjusting the position of each vertex to the average of its neighboring\\nvertices:\\nV new\\ni = V old\\ni + λ\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\uf8ed 1\\n|N(i)|\\nX\\nj∈N(i)\\nV old\\nj − V old\\ni\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\uf8f8\\nIn their implementation, the team sets the smoothing factor λ to 0.2 and performs 10 iterations.\\n5.2 Experimental Results\\n5.2.1 Estimated scale factor\\nThe scale factors estimated using the method described earlier are shown in Table 5.

Figure 13\\nillustrates the alignment process for Object 14. First, the team calculates the central points of both the\\npredicted model and the ground truth model, and moves the predicted model to align the central point\\nof the ground truth model. Next, they perform ICP registration for further alignment, significantly\\nreducing the Chamfer distance. Finally, they use gradient descent for additional fine-tuning, and\\nobtain the final transformation matrix. The total Chamfer distance between all 18 predicted models\\nand the ground truths is 0.069441169.\\n6 Best 3D Mesh Reconstruction Team - FoodRiddle\\n6.1 Methodology\\nTo achieve high-quality food mesh reconstruction, the team designed two pipeline processes. For\\nsimple and medium cases, they employed a structure-from-motion approach to determine the pose of\\neach image, followed by mesh reconstruction. Subsequently, a series of post-processing steps were\\nimplemented to recalibrate scale and enhance mesh quality. For cases with only a single image, the\\nteam utilized image generation methods to aid in model generation.\\n6.1.1 Multi-View Reconstruction\\nFor Structure from Motion (SfM), the team extended the state-of-the-art method by incorporating\\nmethodologies. This significantly mitigated the issue of sparse keypoints in weakly textured scenes.\\nFor mesh reconstruction, the team’s method is based on a differentiable renderer and incorporates\\nregularization terms for depth distortion and normal consistency. The Truncated Signed Distance\\nFunction (TSDF) results are used to generate a dense point cloud. In the post-processing stage, the\\nteam applied filtering and outlier removal techniques, identified the contour of the supporting surface,\\nand projected the lower mesh vertices onto the supporting surface. They used the reconstructed\\ncheckerboard to rectify the scale of the model and used Poisson reconstruction to generate a watertight,\\ncomplete mesh of the subject.\\n6.1.2 Single-View Reconstruction\\nFor 3D reconstruction from a single image, the team employed state-of-the-art methods to generate\\nan initial prior mesh. This prior mesh was then jointly corrected with depth structure information.\\n9To adjust the scale, the team estimated the object’s length using the checkerboard as a reference,\\nassuming the object and the checkerboard are on the same plane. They then projected the 3D object\\nback onto the original 2D image to recover a more accurate scale of the object.\\n6.2 Experimental Results\\nThrough a process of nonlinear optimization, the team sought to identify a transformation that\\nminimizes the Chamfer distance between their mesh and the ground truth mesh. This optimization\\naimed to align the two meshes as closely as possible in three-dimensional space. Upon completion of\\nthis process, the average Chamfer distance across the final reconstructions of the 20 objects amounted\\nto 0.0032175 meters. As shown in Table 7, Team FoodRiddle achieved the best scores for both\\nmulti-view and single-view reconstructions, outperforming other teams in the competition.\\nTable 7: Total Errors for Different Teams on Multi-view and Single-view Data\\nTeam Multi-view (1-14) Single-view (16-20)\\nFoodRiddle 0.036362 0.019232\\nININ-VIAUN 0.041552 0.027889\\nV olETA 0.071921 0.058726\\n7 Conclusion\\nIn this report, we provide a summary and analysis of the methodologies and findings from the\\n3D Food Reconstruction challenge.

There are five distinct categories for object types: small vehicles are designated\\nas 1, large vehicles as 2, pedestrians as 3, motorcyclists and bicyclists as 4, traffic cones as 5, and\\nothers as 6.\\n3.1.1 Evaluation Metric\\nFor the assessment, the categories of small and large vehicles are merged into a single category\\ntermed ’vehicle’. The challenge requires using the initial three seconds of data from each sequence as\\ninput to forecast the trajectories of objects for the subsequent three seconds. The objects assessed are\\nthose present in the final frame of the first three seconds. Subsequently, the discrepancies between\\nthe anticipated locations and the actual locations of these objects are calculated.\\nThe following metrics are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms:\\n1. Average Displacement Error (ADE): This metric represents the average Euclidean distance between\\nall predicted positions and their corresponding actual positions throughout the forecasting period.\\n2. Final Displacement Error (FDE): This metric calculates the average Euclidean distance between the\\nultimately predicted positions and the actual final positions. Given the varying scales of trajectories\\nfor vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists, a weighted sum of ADE (WSADE) and a weighted sum of\\nFDE (WSFDE) are employed as metrics.\\nWSADE = Dv · ADEv + Dp · ADEp + Db · ADEb (1)\\nWSFDE = Dv · FDEv + Dp · FDEp + Db · FDEb (2)\\nHere, Dv, Dp, and Db are associated with the inverse of the average speeds of vehicles, pedestrians,\\nand bicyclists in the dataset, with values set at 0.20, 0.58, and 0.22, respectively.\\n3.2 3D Detection Challenge\\nThe dataset for 3D Lidar object detection features LiDAR-scanned point clouds accompanied by\\ndetailed annotations. It was gathered in Beijing, China, under diverse conditions of lighting and\\ntraffic density. Specifically, the dataset encompasses intricate traffic patterns that include a mix of\\nvehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians.\\n3.2.1 Data Structure\\nEach annotated file for 3D Lidar object detection represents a one-minute sequence captured at\\ntwo frames per second. An entry within each file includes the frame number, object ID, object\\nclassification, positions along the x, y, and z axes, object dimensions (length, width, height), and\\norientation. Object classifications are consistent with those in the trajectory data. In this evaluation, the\\nfirst two categories—small and large vehicles—are considered as a single ’vehicle’ class. Positional\\ndata is relative, with units in meters, and the heading angle denotes the object’s steering direction.\\n3.2.2 Evaluation Metric\\nThe evaluation metric is analogous to the one defined in prior work. The aim of the 3D object\\ndetection task is to develop detectors for ’vehicle’, ’pedestrian’, and ’bicyclist’ categories. These\\ndetectors should estimate the 3D bounding box (dimensions and position) and provide a detection\\nscore or confidence. It is important to note that not all objects within the point clouds are labeled.\\nThe performance of 3D object detection is assessed using the mean Average Precision (mAP),\\nbased on Intersection over Union (IoU). The evaluation standard aligns with the 2D object detection\\nbenchmark, utilizing 3D bounding box overlap. The ultimate metric is the average mAP across\\nvehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists, with IoU thresholds set at 0.7 for cars, and 0.5 for both pedestrians\\nand cyclists.\\n24 Methods and Teams\\n4.1 Trajectory prediction\\nOne team utilized an encoder-decoder framework based on LSTM for predicting trajectories on city\\nstreets. To enhance prediction accuracy, they implemented four sequence-to-sequence sub-models\\nto capture the distinct movement characteristics of various traffic participants. They produced a\\nfuture trajectory for each agent through a three-step process: encoding, perturbation, and decoding.\\nInitially, an encoder was employed to embed the past trajectory. Subsequently, they introduced a\\n16-dimensional random noise to the encoder’s output to accommodate the multimodal distribution of\\nthe data. Finally, they generated the predicted trajectory via a decoder that mirrored the encoder’s\\nstructure.\\nIn addition, they attempted to capture the collective influence among road agents using an interaction\\ntechnique. Improving upon the original methodology, they conducted an interaction operation at each\\nmoment during the encoding and decoding phases. The interaction module embedded the positions\\nof all agents and generated a comprehensive 128-dimensional spatiotemporal representation using\\nan LSTM unit. The derived feature was then relayed to the encoders or decoders for the primary\\nprediction task. Each encoder or decoder, linked to a particular individual, produced the private\\ninteraction within a confined area through an attention operation, utilizing the aforementioned global\\nfeature and the agent’s position. Their experimental findings indicated that the interaction module\\nenhanced prediction accuracy on the dataset.\\n4.2 3D Detection\\nOne team introduced an innovative approach termed sparse-to-dense 3D object detector (STD). STD\\nis characterized as a two-stage, point-based detection system. The initial phase involves a bottom-up\\nnetwork for generating proposals, where spherical anchors are seeded on each point to encompass\\nobjects at various orientations. This spherical anchor design reduces computational load and shortens\\ninference time by eliminating the need to account for differently oriented objects during anchor\\ncreation. Subsequently, points within these spherical anchors are collected to form proposals for\\nadditional refinement. In the second phase, a PointsPool layer is introduced to transform the features\\nof proposals from point-based representations to compact grid formats. These dense features are then\\nprocessed through a prediction head, which includes two extra fully-connected layers, to derive the\\nfinal detection outcomes. A 3D intersection-over-union (IoU) branch is also incorporated into the\\nprediction head to estimate the 3D IoU between the final predictions and the ground-truth bounding\\nboxes, thereby enhancing localization precision.\\nDuring the training process, four distinct data augmentation techniques were employed to mitigate\\noverfitting. Initially, similar to previous methods, ground-truth bounding boxes with their correspond-\\ning interior points were randomly added from different scenes to the existing point cloud, simulating\\nobjects in varied settings. Subsequently, each bounding box was randomly rotated based on a uniform\\ndistribution and subjected to random translation. Additionally, every point cloud was randomly\\nflipped along the x-axis with a 50% probability. Lastly, random rotation and scaling were applied to\\neach point cloud using uniformly distributed random variables. In the testing phase, predictions were\\nfirst obtained on both the original and the x-axis flipped point clouds, and these results were then\\nmerged using Soft-NMS to produce the final predictions.\\nAnother team’s strategy is based on the PointPillars framework. The network configuration largely\\nmirrors that of the original work, with adjustments made to accommodate multiple anchors for\\neach class. The substantial variation in the size of objects within each class suggested that a single\\nanchor might be inadequate. The k-means algorithm was utilized to create five anchors for each class.\\nAnother modification involved deactivating the direction classification in the loss function, as the\\nevaluation metric relies on IOU, which is not affected by direction. Detailed settings for each class\\nare presented in Table 1.\\nTo enhance training data, global translation and scaling of the point cloud, along with rotation and\\ntranslation for each ground truth, were implemented. Global rotation of the point cloud was omitted\\nas it was found to produce less favorable outcomes. The specific parameters for these adjustments are\\ndetailed in Table 2.\\n3Table 1: Detailed settings for each class. MNP indicates the maximum number of points, and MNV\\nrepresents the maximum number of voxels.\\nClass Number of anchors V oxel size MNP MNV\\nCar 5 [0.28,0.28,32] 50 20000\\nBicyclist 5 [0.14,0.14,32] 20 80000\\nPedestrian 5 [0.10,0.10,32] 15 80000\\nTable 2: Augmentation parameters for training data.\\nGlobal Rotation Global Translation Global Scaling Ground Truth Rotation Ground Truth Translation\\n[0.2,0.2,0.2] [0.95,1.1] [-/20, /20] [0.25,0.25,0.25]\\nTest Time Augmentation was employed to enhance performance. For every point cloud, four iterations\\nwere generated: the original, and versions flipped along the x-axis, y-axis, and both axes. Each\\niteration was processed by the network to obtain bounding box predictions, which were subsequently\\nunflipped. Due to the flipping operation, anchors across iterations have a one-to-one correspondence.\\nFor each anchor, the corresponding predicted boxes were combined by averaging the location, size,\\nand class probability. Redundant boxes were then eliminated using Non-Maximum Suppression\\n(NMS).\\nAnother Team introduced enhancements to the PointPillars method. Their approach incorporated\\nresidual learning and channel attention mechanisms into the baseline architecture. The network is\\ncomposed of the original Pillar Feature Network, an extended 2D CNN backbone, and a detection\\nhead for foreground/background classification and regression. The deeper backbone significantly\\nimproves detection accuracy compared to the original PointPillars. A separate network was trained\\nfor each class in the Apollo training dataset to perform binary classification, resulting in four distinct\\nnetworks. Final predictions were compiled by aggregating all foreground predictions from these\\nnetworks.\\nFor dataset preprocessing, methods from the KITTI dataset were adapted, including positive example\\nsampling, global rotation, individual object rotation, and random scaling for each object. However,\\nunlike the KITTI approach, global rotation was excluded, and the ranges for scaling and rotation were\\nreduced. Additionally, more foreground point clouds were sampled to augment positive examples.\\nTable 3 details the specific settings for each class.\\nTable 3: Detailed settings for each class.

       "  'file_content': 'Premature Termination Strategy for Deep Image Prior\\nAbstract\\nDeep Image Prior (DIP) and its variations have demonstrated significant promise in addressing inverse problems in\\ncomputational imaging, without the need for separate training data. Often, practical DIP models are significantly\\noverparameterized. These models initially capture the intended visual content during the learning phase and\\nsubsequently incorporate potential modeling and observational noise, demonstrating a pattern of initial learning\\nfollowed by overfitting (ELTO). Consequently, the practical application of DIP depends on an early stopping (ES)\\nmechanism capable of identifying this transitional period. Most previous DIP research in computational imaging\\nhas focused on demonstrating the models’ potential by reporting peak performance against ground truth, without\\nproviding practical methods to achieve near-peak performance without access to ground truth. This paper aims to\\novercome this practical limitation of DIP by introducing an efficient ES strategy that reliably identifies near-peak\\nperformance across various computational imaging tasks and DIP variants. This ES method, based on the running\\nvariance of intermediate reconstructions in DIP, not only surpasses existing methods that are limited to specific\\nconditions but also maintains its effectiveness when combined with techniques aimed at reducing overfitting.\\n1 Introduction\\nInverse problems (IPs) are widespread in the field of computational imaging, encompassing tasks from fundamental image denoising,\\nsuper-resolution, and deblurring to complex 3D reconstruction and significant challenges in scientific and medical imaging. Despite\\nthe variety of settings, all these problems involve recovering a visual object x from an observation y = f(x), where f represents the\\nforward physical process. Usually, these visual IPs are underdetermined, meaning x cannot be uniquely ascertained from y. This\\nambiguity is further complicated by potential modeling inaccuracies (such as using a linear f to approximate a nonlinear process)\\nand observational noise (like Gaussian or shot noise), represented as y ˘2248 f(x). To address nonuniqueness and enhance stability\\nagainst noise, researchers often integrate a range of problem-specific priors on x when formulating IPs.\\n2 Related Work\\nThere are three primary methods to counteract the overfitting of DIP models. The first one is Regularization: Overfitting is lessened\\nby limiting the size of G˘03b8 to the underparameterization range. Layer-wise weights or the network Jacobian are regularized to\\nregulate the network capacity. The total-variation norm or trained denoisers are used as additional regularizers R(G˘03b8(z)). To\\nprevent overfitting, these techniques need the proper amount of regularization, which varies depending on the kind and degree of\\nnoise. They may nevertheless cause overfitting if the regularization level is incorrect. Furthermore, even when they are successful,\\nthe performance peak is delayed until the last few iterations, which frequently increases the computing cost by several times. The\\nsecond method is Noise modeling: In their optimization objective, sparse additive noise is explicitly represented. Regularizers and\\nES criteria are created especially for Gaussian and shot noise. Subgradient techniques using decreasing step size schedules are\\nbeing investigated for impulse noise with the ˘21131 loss, and they have shown some early promise. These techniques are ineffective\\noutside of the noise types and levels that they are designed to address, and our understanding of the noise in a particular visual\\nIP is often constrained. The third method is Early stopping (ES): Progress is tracked using a ratio of no-reference blurriness and\\nsharpness, however, as the authors point out, the criterion is only applicable to their modified DIP models. It is unclear how to apply\\nthe noise-specific regularizer and ES criterion to unknown noise types and levels. It is suggested to monitor DIP reconstruction by\\ntraining a coupled autoencoder. Although it performs similarly to ours, the additional autoencoder training significantly increases the\\noverall processing time. By dividing the elements of y into \"training\" and \"validation\" sets, it is possible to simulate validation-based\\nES in supervised learning. However, in IPs, particularly nonlinear ones (such as blind image deblurring (BID), where y ˘2248 k\\n˘2217 x and ˘2217 denotes linear convolution), elements of y may not be i.i.d., which could impair the effectiveness of validation.\\nFurthermore, withholding a portion of the observation in y can significantly diminish peak performance.3 Methodology\\nWe advocate for the ES approach because, even when effective, regularization and noise modeling techniques frequently fail to\\nenhance peak performance; instead, they extend it to the final iterations, potentially requiring ten times more iterations than would be\\nnecessary to reach the peak in the original DIP models. Furthermore, both approaches necessitate extensive knowledge of the noise\\ntype and level, which is often unavailable for most applications. If their essential models and hyperparameters are not appropriately\\nconfigured, overfitting is likely to persist, and ES will still be necessary. This paper introduces a novel ES criterion applicable to\\nvarious DIP models, based on monitoring the trend of the running variance in the reconstruction sequence.\\nDetecting transition by running variance:\\nOur lightweight method only involves computing the V AR curve and numerically detecting its valley˘2014 the iteration stops once the\\nvalley is detected. To obtain the curve, we set a window size parame- ter W and compute the windowed moving variance (WMV). To\\nrobustly detect the valley, we introduce a patience number P to tolerate up to P consecutive steps of variance stagnation. Obviously,\\nthe cost is dominated by the calculation of variance per step, which is O(W N ) (N is the size of the visual object). In comparison, a\\ntypical gradient update step for solving Eq. (2) costs at least ˘2126(|˘03b8|N ), where |˘03b8| is the number of parameters in the DNN\\nG˘03b8. Since | ˘03b8| is typically much larger than W (default: 100), our running V AR and detection incur very little compu- tational\\noverhead.\\n4 Experiments\\nES-WMV is tested for DIP in a variety of linear and nonlinear IPs, including image denoising, inpainting, demosaicing, super-\\nresolution, MRI reconstruction, and blind image deblurring. ES-WMV is also systematically assessed for major DIP variants, such\\nas deep decoder, DIP-TV , and GP-DIP, for image denoising. It is shown to be a dependable helper in identifying effective ES\\npoints. The specifics of the DIP variants are covered in Appendix A.5. In addition, ES-WMV is contrasted with the primary rival\\ntechniques, such as DF-STE, SV-ES, DOP, SB, and V AL. The specifics of the primary ES-based techniques are found in Appendix\\nA.6. Reconstruction quality is evaluated using both PSNR and SSIM, and detection performance is shown using PSNR and SSIM\\ngaps, which are the differences between our detected and peak values.\\n4.1 Image Denoising\\nThe majority of earlier research on DIP overfitting has concentrated on image denoising and often assessed their techniques using\\nonly one or two forms of noise with modest noise levels, such as low-level Gaussian noise. We use the traditional 9-image dataset\\nfor each noise type, and we create two noise levels˘2014low and high˘2014for each.\\n4.2 Image Super-Resolution\\nIn this task, we try to recover a clean im- age x0 from a noisy downsampled ver- sion y = Dt(x0) + ˘03f5, where Dt( ˘00b7) : [0,\\n1]3˘00d7tH˘00d7tW ˘2192 [0, 1]3˘00d7H˘00d7W is a down- sampling operator that resizes an im- age by the factor t and ˘03f5 models\\nex- tra additive noise. We consider the fol- lowing DIP-reparametrized formulation . = ˘2225Dt(G˘03b8(z)) ˘2212 y˘22252 min˘03b8\\n˘2113(˘03b8) F , where G˘03b8 is a trainable DNN parameterized by ˘03b8 and z is a frozen random seed. Then we conduct experiments\\nfor 2˘00d7 super- resolution with low-level Gaussian and impulse noise. We test our ES-WMV for DIP and a state-of-the-art zero-shot\\nmethod based on pre-trained diffusion model˘2014DDNM+ on the standard super-resolution dataset Set14, as shown in Tab. 5, Fig.\\n11, and Appendix A.7.9. We note that DDNM+ relies on pre-trained models from large external training datasets, while DIP does\\nnot. We observe that (1) Our ES-WMV is again able to detect near-peak performance for most images: the average PSNR gap is\\n˘2264 1.50 and the average SSIM gap is ˘2264 0.07; (2) DDNM+ is sensitive to the noise type and level: from Tab. 5, DDNM+ trained\\nassuming Gaussian noise level ˘03c3y = 0.12 outperforms DIP and DIP+ES-WMV when there is Gaus- sian measurement noise at\\nthe level ˘03c3y = 0.12, which is unrealistic in practice, as the noise level is often unknown beforehand. When the noise level is not\\nset correctly, e.g., as ˘03c3y = 0 in the DDNM+ (˘03c3y = .00) row of Tab. 5, the performance of DDNM+ is much worse than that of\\nDIP and DIP+ES-WMV . Also, for super-resolution with impulse noise, DIP is also a clear winner that leads DDNM+ by a large\\nmargin; and (3) in Appendix A.8, we show that DDNM+ may also suffer from the overfitting issue.\\n4.3 MRI Reconstruction\\nWe also test ES-WMV on MRI reconstruction, a typical linear IP with a nontrivial forward mapping: y ˘2248 F(x), where F is the\\nsubsampled Fourier operator, and we use ˘2248 to indicate that the noise encountered in practical MRI imaging may be hybrid (e.g.,\\nadditive, shot) and uncertain. Here, we take the 8-fold undersampling and parameterize x using ˘201cConv-Decoder˘201d, a variant of\\ndeep decoder. Due to the heavy over-parameterization, overfitting occurs and ES is needed.\\n24.4 Blind Image Deblurring\\nIn BID, a blurry and noisy image is given, and the goal is to recover a sharp and clean image. The blur is mostly caused by motion\\nand/or op- tical non-ideality in the camera, and the forward process is often modeled as y = k ˘2217 x + n, where k is the blur\\nkernel, n models additive sensory noise, and ˘2217 is linear convolution to model the spa- tial uniformity of the blur effect. BID\\nis a very challenging visual IP due to bilin- earity: (k, x) 7 ˘2192 k ˘2217 x. Recently, researchers have tried to use DIP models to\\nsolve BID by modeling k and x as two separate DNNs, i.e., min˘03b8k,˘03b8x ˘2225y ˘2212 G˘03b8k (zk) ˘2217 G˘03b8x(zx)˘22252 2 +\\n˘03bb˘2225˘2207G˘03b8x (zx)˘22251/˘2225˘2207G˘03b8x (zx)˘22252, where the regular- izer is to promote sparsity in the gradient domain\\nfor the reconstruction of x, as stan- dard in BID. We follow previous work and choose a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with softmax\\nactivation for G˘03b8k , and the canonical DIP model (CNN-based encoder-decoder architecture) for G˘03b8x(zx). We change their\\nregularizer from the original ˘2225˘2207G˘03b8x (zx)˘22251 to the current, as their original formulation is tested only at a very low\\nnoise level ˘03c3 = 10˘22125 and no overfitting is observed. We set the test with a higher noise level ˘03c3 = 10˘22123, and find that its\\noriginal formulation does not work.\\n5 Results\\nTable 1: Summary of performance of our DIP+ES-WMV and competing methods on image denoising and blind image deblurring\\n(BID). ˘2713: working reasonably well (PSNR ˘2265 2dB less of the original DIP peak); -: not working well (PSNR ˘2264 2dB less of\\nthe original DIP peak): N/A: not applicable (i.e., we do not perform comparison due to certain reasons).

       "  'file_content': 'Acquiring the Ability to Recommend Interventions for Tuberculosis\\nTreatment Through the Utilization of Digital Adherence Information\\nAbstract\\nDigital Adherence Technologies (DATs) are becoming progressively favored as a means of confirming patients’\\nadherence to various medications. This paper examines the information gathered from a city that utilizes 99DOTS,\\na telephone-based DAT implemented for tuberculosis (TB) treatment in India, where approximately 3 million\\nindividuals are diagnosed with the disease annually. The dataset encompasses approximately 17,000 patients\\nand 2.1 million dosage records. This research establishes the basis for deriving insights from this real-world\\ndata, encompassing a methodology to circumvent the influence of unrecorded interventions in the training\\ndata employed for machine learning. Subsequently, a deep learning model is developed, its interpretability is\\nillustrated, and it is demonstrated how it can be modified and trained under diverse clinical conditions to more\\neffectively target and enhance patient treatment. In the context of real-time risk prediction, the model could be\\nemployed to proactively intervene with 21% more patients and prevent 76% more missed doses compared to\\nthe current heuristic benchmarks. Regarding outcome prediction, the model exhibits 40% improvement over\\nbaseline approaches, enabling cities to allocate more resources to clinics with a higher proportion of patients\\nsusceptible to treatment failure. Lastly, a case study is presented that illustrates how the model can be trained in an\\nend-to-end, decision-focused learning framework to realize a 15% enhancement in solution quality in a sample\\ndecision problem encountered by healthcare professionals.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has identified tuberculosis (TB) as one of the leading ten causes of mortality globally, despite\\nit being a curable and preventable disease in the majority of instances. The widespread occurrence of TB is partially attributable\\nto inadequate adherence to medication, which leads to an elevated probability of mortality, reinfection, and the development of\\ndrug-resistant strains of TB. To address the issue of non-adherence, the WHO advocates for directly observed treatment (DOT),\\nwherein a healthcare professional directly observes and validates a patient’s daily intake of the necessary medication. Nevertheless,\\nthe necessity for patients to commute to the DOT facility imposes a financial strain and potentially introduces social stigma because\\nof the public apprehension surrounding the disease. These obstacles make it challenging to eradicate TB, as they contribute to\\npatients being lost to follow-up. Consequently, digital adherence technologies (DATs), which offer patients adaptable methods to\\ndemonstrate adherence, have experienced a surge in popularity on a global scale.\\nDATs empower patients to be \"observed\" consuming their medication electronically through various means, such as two-way\\ntext messaging, video recording, electronic pill containers, or toll-free phone calls. Healthcare professionals can subsequently\\nmonitor patient adherence in real-time using a dashboard. Besides enhancing patient adaptability and confidentiality, the dashboard\\nempowers healthcare personnel to categorize patients and allocate their constrained resources towards those at the highest risk.\\nInitial research indicates that DATs have the potential to enhance adherence in various disease contexts, thereby stimulating their\\nutilization and assessment for the management of TB adherence. The WHO has even issued a manual for the effective incorporation\\nof this technology in TB patient care.\\nIn this paper, the focus is on investigating how the extensive longitudinal data generated by DATs can be utilized to assist health\\nworkers in better triaging TB patients and providing interventions to enhance the overall adherence of their patient group. The data\\nunder analysis originates from Mumbai, India, and is the result of a collaboration with the City TB Office of Mumbai. They have\\nput into practice a DAT that enables patients to verify their adherence by making daily toll-free calls. The DAT system was set\\nup with technical assistance from the healthcare technology company Everwell and is recognized as 99DOTS. Everwell provides\\nsupport for the implementation of 99DOTS across India, where there were an estimated 2.7 million cases of TB in 2017. In Mumbai,\\npatients registered in 99DOTS currently receive interventions based on the following broad guidelines. If they have not taken their\\nmedication by the afternoon, they (and their health worker) get a text message reminder. If the patient still does not take their\\nmedication after some time, the worker will call the patient directly. Lastly, if a patient does not respond to these interventions after\\na certain number of days, they may be personally visited by a health worker. It is important to note that a significant number of these\\npatients reside in communities with limited resources, where each health worker is responsible for managing dozens to hundredsof patients, far exceeding their capacity for daily visits. Therefore, models that can pinpoint patients at risk of missing doses and\\nprioritize interventions by health workers are of the utmost importance.\\nAt first, the challenge of determining whom to target for an intervention seems to be a straightforward supervised machine learning\\ntask. Provided with information regarding a patient’s medication adherence as indicated by their calls to the 99DOTS system, it is\\npossible to train a machine learning model to forecast whether they will miss medication doses in the future. Nevertheless, such a\\nmodel disregards the simultaneous interventions carried out by health workers during the data collection period and may result in\\nerroneous prioritization choices, even when it exhibits high accuracy. As an illustration, it might be observed that missed doses are\\nsucceeded by a phase of medication adherence. This observation does not imply that individuals who miss doses are more inclined\\nto take medication, but rather suggests that an intervention by a health worker likely occurred, after which the patient resumed their\\nmedication.\\nTherefore, to prescribe interventions, it’s necessary to separate the impact of manual interventions from other underlying elements\\nthat contribute to missed doses. However, because this data was gathered through a wide-ranging implementation involving actual\\npatients, it incorporates the impacts of interventions executed by healthcare personnel. An added difficulty is that healthcare workers\\nseldom document their interventions within the 99DOTS system, making it hard to gauge their consequences. Although there is a\\nsubstantial body of research on assessing heterogeneous treatment effects, conventional methods consistently necessitate awareness\\nof which patients underwent an intervention. It should be noted that such omissions will be prevalent as nations enthusiastically\\nimplement DAT systems with the aim of aiding low-income areas. To facilitate the provision of enhanced care, it is imperative that\\nwe can glean insights from this complex yet abundant data.\\nHence, a general strategy is introduced for acquiring knowledge from adherence data with unrecorded interventions, grounded in\\ndomain expertise regarding the intervention heuristics used by healthcare workers. A proxy is created for interventions evident in\\nthe historical 99DOTS data, and a model is devised to aid in prioritizing intervention targets for healthcare workers across various\\nclinical scenarios.\\n2 Methodology\\nThe TB treatment system functions under severe resource constraints; for instance, a single health worker might be in charge of\\nover 100 patients. Therefore, it is essential that workers can precisely evaluate patient risk and prioritize interventions appropriately.\\nAlthough machine learning can be employed to carry out such risk assessment with encouraging precision, it necessitates careful\\nconsideration of how intervention resources were distributed in the current data.\\nA significant obstacle arises from the fact that users of the 99DOTS platform typically do not document interventions. Health\\nworkers might send texts, make calls, or conduct personal visits to patients in an effort to boost adherence, but these interventions are\\nnot systematically recorded in the data. Although far from perfect, these gaps are unavoidable as countries with varying reporting\\nstandards adopt DATs for TB treatment. Considering the wealth of data produced by DATs and their potential to affect human\\nlives, the importance of learning lessons in this demanding setting where unobserved interventions take place is emphasized. This\\nchallenge is subsequently addressed by developing a screening procedure that recognizes patients who were probable candidates for\\nspecific interventions.\\nThe aim is to utilize the accessible data to create an approximation for when an intervention likely took place, enabling the training\\nof models on data points unaffected by interventions. The initial step involves differentiating between various categories of health\\nworker interventions. Specifically, a house visit is regarded as a \"resource-limited\" intervention, given that workers are unable to visit\\nall their patients promptly. Typically, this represents a last resort for health workers when patients are unresponsive to alternative\\nmethods. On the other hand, calls and texts are viewed as \"non-resource-limited\" interventions, as they could feasibly be conducted\\non a large patient population at minimal expense.\\nTo develop the proxy, a search was conducted for health worker guidelines concerning house visits. The 2005 guide by India’s\\nRevised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) mandated that workers perform a house visit after a single missed dose.\\nHowever, more recent guidelines are considerably more ambiguous on this matter. Both the latest guide by the WHO and the\\nRNTCP leave house visits to the health worker’s discretion. Nevertheless, through discussions in Mumbai, it was discerned that\\nhealth workers give precedence to non-adherent patients for resource-limited interventions like house visits. Consequently, the proxy\\nwas formulated based on the adherence dashboard accessible to health workers.\\nThe 99DOTS dashboard provides a daily \"Attention Required\" status for each patient. Initially, if a patient has a record in the Patient\\nLog, signifying that a provider made a note about the patient within the preceding 7 days, their status is automatically adjusted to\\n\"MEDIUM\" attention. However, this guideline impacts fewer than 1% of the labels. The remaining 99% of labels are determined as\\nfollows: if a patient misses 0 or 1 doses in the past 7 days, their attention level is changed to \"MEDIUM.\" If they miss 4 or more, it\\nis changed to \"HIGH.\" Patients with 2-3 missed doses maintain their attention level from the day before. As a conservative proxy, it\\nwas assumed that only \"HIGH\" attention patients were candidates for resource-limited interventions, considering that the attention\\nlevel serves as a health worker’s primary overview of recent patient adherence. This \"Attention Required\" system for screening\\nresource-limited interventions is applicable to any daily adherence context; one only needs to ascertain the threshold for a change to\\nHIGH attention.\\n2Employing this screening system, sequences of days can be identified during which a patient was a candidate for a resource-limited\\nintervention, and subsequently, the use of signal from those days in the training task can be avoided.\\n3 Experiments\\nThe objective was to create a model that mirrors the daily routine of a health worker, which involves analyzing their patients’ recent\\ncall records to gauge adherence risk and subsequently planning various types of interventions. Enhanced prediction capabilities\\nenable workers to engage with a greater number of patients proactively, prior to their missing crucial doses.\\nThe process began with the entire group of 16,975 patients and proceeded to create training samples from each patient in the\\nfollowing manner. All consecutive sequences of 14 days of call data were considered, ensuring that the initial 7 days of each\\nsequence did not overlap. The first 7 days of each patient’s treatment, as well as the final day, were omitted to prevent any bias that\\nmight arise from interactions with health workers during the initiation or conclusion of treatment. Two filtering steps were then\\nimplemented. Initially, samples were excluded where the patient had in excess of 2 doses manually recorded by a provider during the\\ninput sequence, as these patients likely had contact with their provider outside of the 99DOTS system. Secondly, samples in which\\nthe patient did not miss any doses in the input sequence were removed. Although these samples constituted the majority of the data,\\nthey included almost no positive (HIGH risk) labels, which distorted the training process. Moreover, positive predictions for patients\\nwho missed 0 doses are improbable to be beneficial; no resource-limited intervention can be implemented so extensively that patients\\nwith flawless recent adherence are targeted. The aforementioned steps yielded 16,015 samples, of which 2,437 were positive.\\nEach sample comprised a time-series of call data along with static characteristics. The time series encompassed two sequences of 7\\nin length for every sample. The initial sequence was a binary representation of call data, where 1 signified a call or manual dose\\nand 0 indicated a miss. The subsequent sequence represented a cumulative count of all doses missed up to that specific day, taking\\ninto account the patient’s entire history within the program. The static features incorporated four demographic attributes from the\\nPatient Table: weight-band, age-band, gender, and treatment center ID. Supplementary features were derived from the patient Call\\nLogs and captured a patient’s behavior beyond mere adherence. For instance, did the patient call at a consistent time each morning\\nor at irregular intervals throughout the day? This was captured by calculating the mean and variance of the call minute and hour.\\nAdditional features encompassed the number of calls, number of manual doses, and the mean, maximum, and variance of calls per\\nday, in addition to days per call. Analogous features were also incorporated, which exclusively utilized unique calls per day (i.e.,\\ncalls to distinct phone numbers) or disregarded manual doses. This procedure resulted in 29 descriptive features.\\nInitially, standard models were tested that utilize solely the static features: linear regression, a random forest (with 100 trees and a\\nmaximum depth of 5), and a support vector machine. The random forest exhibited the best performance, so the others are omitted for\\nthe sake of clarity. To make use of the time series data, a deep network was also constructed, designated as LEAP (Lstm rEal-time\\nAdherence Predictor), which accepts both the time series and static features as input. LEAP comprises two input layers: 1) an LSTM\\nwith 64 hidden units for the time series input, and 2) a dense layer with 100 units for the static feature input. The outputs of these\\ntwo layers were concatenated and fed forward into another dense layer with 16 units, followed by a single sigmoid activation unit. A\\nbatch size of 128 was employed, and training was conducted for 20 epochs.\\nTo assess the models, all data was randomized, and 25% was set aside as the test set. A 4-fold grid search was employed to ascertain\\nthe optimal model parameters. To address class imbalance, SMOTE was utilized to oversample the training set, implemented using\\nthe Python library imblearn. Features were also normalized as percentiles using SKLearn, which was empirically found to be\\neffective. The benchmark for comparison was the method employed by the current 99DOTS platform to evaluate risk, namely, doses\\nmissed by the patient in the preceding week (lw-Misses).\\n4 Results\\nThe models were compared against the baseline. The random forest slightly surpasses the baseline, and LEAP distinctly outperforms\\nboth. Nevertheless, to gauge the efficacy of the methods relative to the baseline, a comparison is made regarding how each method\\ncould be applied to strategize house-visit interventions. Given that this constitutes a highly constrained resource, the most stringent\\nbaseline threshold was established to contemplate patients for this intervention, specifically, 3 missed calls. Maintaining the FPR of\\nthis baseline method, it is demonstrated how many more patients in the test set would be reached weekly by the proposed method\\n(owing to its enhanced TPR), alongside the enhancement in the quantity of missed doses detected. To ascertain the number of missed\\ndoses caught, only missed doses that transpired before the patient’s transition to HIGH risk are counted. The model identifies 21.6%\\nmore patients and captures 76.5% more missed doses, signifying substantially more accurate targeting than the baseline.\\nIt is shown that the model also surpasses the baseline as both the true positive rate (TPR) and FPR escalate, underscoring the model’s\\nsuperior discriminatory capability. This proves advantageous for interventions not constrained by resources, like calls or texts. It\\nis important to remember that the screening procedure is not pertinent to this category of intervention; therefore, the predictions\\ncan solely advocate for supplementary interventions. It is crucial that additional interventions are meticulously aimed, as repeated\\nengagement with a specific patient diminishes the effectiveness of each subsequent interaction over time. This emphasizes the\\nsignificance of the enhanced precision provided by the model, as merely inundating the entire population with calls and texts is\\nprobable to be ineffective.\\n3The model has the capability to prevent a greater number of missed doses compared to existing approaches. Nonetheless, these\\nadvancements cannot be realized unless health workers on the ground administer interventions in accordance with the predictions.\\nConsequently, interpretability emerges as a crucial determinant of the model’s utility, as health workers must comprehend the\\nrationale behind the model’s predictions to trust it and incorporate its logic with their own professional expertise.\\nThe superior predictive performance was attained with LEAP, a black-box network, as opposed to an inherently interpretable model\\nsuch as linear regression. As a result, it is demonstrated how a visualization instrument can assist users in extracting insights\\nregarding the model’s reasoning. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) python library was employed, which produces\\nvisualizations to elucidate machine learning models. It is illustrated how static features affect the model’s prediction, where red\\nfeatures drive predictions toward 1 (HIGH) and blue toward 0 (MEDIUM). It is important to recall that features are scaled as\\npercentiles. In the blue region, it is observed that this patient makes an above-average number of calls each week, pushing the\\nprediction toward 0. Conversely, in the red region, it is noted that this patient has a very low average but a high variability in time\\nbetween calls. These features capture that this patient missed two days of calls, then made three calls on one day in an attempt to\\n\"back log\" their previous missed calls. The model learned that this is a high-risk behavior.\\nFour distinct samples are presented as input to the LSTM layer of the model. On the left, the binary input sequence is depicted as\\ncolored pixels, where black represents a call and yellow signifies a missed call. On the right, SHAP values corresponding to each\\nday of adherence data are displayed, and grey denotes the commencement of the call sequence. It is observed that the model has\\ndiscerned that calls made later in the week carry more weight than those made earlier. In Sample 1, the bottom two pixels (the most\\nrecent calls) have blue SHAP values, while the other pixels have SHAP values close to 0. In Sample 3, a single missed call at the\\nbeginning of the week, combined with a call made at the end of the week, result in essentially canceling SHAP values. Sample 4\\nalso has one missed call, but on the last day of the week, resulting in a net positive SHAP value.\\nThis visualization method offers intuitive insights into the principles acquired by the model. In a real-world application, healthcare\\nprofessionals could produce these visualizations for any given sample on-the-fly to support their decision-making procedure.\\n5 Conclusion\\nA framework is introduced for acquiring the ability to generate intervention recommendations from data produced by DAT systems\\nused in TB care. A comprehensive strategy is formulated for learning from medical adherence data that includes unrecorded\\ninterventions, and this strategy is utilized to construct a model for forecasting risk in various contexts. In the real-time adherence\\nscenario, it is demonstrated that the model would empower health workers to more precisely direct interventions to high-risk patients\\nat an earlier stage, identifying 21% more patients and preventing 76% more missed doses than the existing heuristic benchmark.\\nSubsequently, the model is trained for outcome prediction, illustrating how adherence data can more accurately detect patients\\nat risk of unfavorable treatment outcomes. Insights are then derived that could assist health workers in accurately identifying\\nLCFO patients using a straightforward rule after a mere 7 days of treatment. Finally, it is demonstrated that adapting the LEAP\\nmodel for a particular intervention through decision-focused learning can enhance performance by an additional 15%. The learning\\nmethodologies presented here are versatile and could be applied to analyze data generated by DATs for any medication schedule.\\nGiven the increasing adoption of DAT systems for TB, HIV , diabetes, heart disease, and other medications, this work aims to\\nestablish the groundwork for enhanced patient outcomes in healthcare settings worldwide.\\n6 Outcome Prediction\\nThe subsequent phase involves an investigation into how adherence data can be employed to forecast the ultimate treatment outcome.\\nConventional studies on TB treatment typically model outcomes solely in relation to patient covariates, such as demographic\\ncharacteristics. By utilizing daily real-time adherence data furnished by DATs, an exploration is conducted into how employing\\nthe initial k days of a patient’s adherence facilitates more precise, individualized outcome predictions. It is important to note\\nthat intervention effects are still discernible in this configuration. Nevertheless, the screening procedure will not be applicable,\\nas predictions are made over a span of several months, during which practically all patients would have had recurring in-person\\ninteractions with healthcare providers.\\nThe prediction task is formalized in the following manner: given the first k days of adherence data, predict the final binary treatment\\noutcome. \"Cured\" and \"Treatment Complete\" were regarded as favorable outcomes, while \"Died,\" \"Lost to follow-up,\" and\\n\"Treatment Failure\" were considered unfavorable. Solely patients who were assigned an outcome from these classifications are\\nincorporated. Furthermore, given that patients with the outcome \"Died\" or \"Lost to follow-up\" exit the program prior to the full 6\\nmonths of treatment, those who were present for less than k + 1 days were excluded. Lastly, patients who had in excess of half their\\nfirst k days marked as manual doses were omitted. This was inclined to enhance prediction performance, which is conjectured to be\\nassociated with the observation that practices for reporting manual doses varied by health center, rendering the \"significance\" of a\\nmanual dose ambiguous across samples with respect to outcome. The final dataset comprised 4167 samples, with 433 unfavorable\\ncases.\\nThrough discussions in Mumbai, it was learned that health workers often build a sense of a patient’s risk of an unfavorable outcome\\nwithin their first month of treatment. To model this process, k=35 was set for the prediction task, capturing the first month of each\\npatient’s adherence after enrollment in 99DOTS. (Note that this is not a general rule for health workers, but simply served as a\\n4motivation for the choice of k in this task.) Both the static features and the sequence inputs were the same as calculated for the\\nweekly prediction task, but now taken over the initial 35 days. Two versions of the health worker baseline were included: missed\\ndoses in the last week (lw-Misses) and total missed doses in 35 days (t-Misses).\\nThe same models, grid search design, training process, and evaluation procedure as before were used. For the Random Forest, 150\\ntrees were used with no maximum depth. For LEAP, 64 hidden units were used for the LSTM input layer, 48 units for the dense\\nlayer input, and 4 units in the penultimate dense layer.\\nEven the rudimentary baseline of tallying the calls made in the preceding 7 days before the 35-day threshold is somewhat predictive\\nof the outcome, implying that the daily data provided by DATs is valuable in assessing which patients will fail TB treatment. The\\nML models exhibit even greater predictive capability, with LEAP leading in performance, closely followed by the random forest.\\nIt is emphasized how LEAP’s predictive ability could aid officials in minimizing the expenses required to meet medical outcome\\ntargets for their city. For instance, suppose Mumbai initiates a new program to capture 80% of unfavorable outcomes (true positives)\\nby recruiting additional health staff. Across the 17,000 patients in Mumbai, where 10% have unsuccessful outcomes as in the test\\nset, an 80% capture rate necessitates rescuing 1360 patients. Employing either baseline, attaining the 80% TPR necessitates an FPR\\nof 70%, which translates to hiring extra staff to support 10710 total patients in this hypothetical scenario. However, utilizing LEAP\\nonly results in an FPR of 42%, corresponding to 6426 total patients. It is important to remember that in Mumbai, the typical health\\nworker attends to approximately 25 patients. With a yearly starting salary of |216,864, the model would result in |37M in saved costs\\nannually.\\n7 Detecting Low-Call Favorable Outcome Patients\\nAn additional significant hurdle within the 99DOTS system is that certain patients consistently take their doses as directed but opt not\\nto call. Consequently, according to the dashboard, they appear to be missing doses and would be categorized as HIGH risk by both\\n99DOTS and LEAP. However, in actuality, they should be classified as MEDIUM risk. In fact, almost 15% of patients who had an\\noutcome assigned as in section 3 called on fewer than 25% of the days during their treatment, yet experienced a favorable outcome.\\nThese patients are referred to as low-call favorable outcome (LCFO). The aim is to learn to recognize these LCFO patients to avoid\\nincorrectly classifying them as HIGH risk, despite their lack of calls. Additionally, there is a desire to identify these patients early in\\ntheir treatment so they can be reassigned to an adherence monitoring method that is more appropriate for them.\\nThis is framed as a binary prediction task as follows: given the first k days of adherence data, predict whether the patient will both\\ncall on less than 25% of days from day k + 1 onward and have a favorable outcome. Only patients who were assigned an outcome as\\nin Section 3 and who had at least k + 7 days of adherence data were included. To detect LCFO status as early as possible, k was set\\nto 7. Thus, the final dataset contained 7265 patients, of which 1124 were positive. Note that this population was larger than that of\\nthe outcome prediction task because 1) patients were required to be in the program for less time and 2) patients were not removed\\nfor having too many manual doses since this was found to correlate with being LCFO.\\nBoth the static features and the sequence inputs were the same as calculated for the outcome prediction task, but this time taken over\\nthe initial 7 days. The health worker baseline of missed doses in the last week (lw-Misses) was included, along with a random forest\\ntrained only on demographic or \"0-day\" data (RF 0-day), a simple baseline that counts the number of manual doses in the last week\\n(lw-Manual), a random forest trained on all non-sequence features over the initial 7 days (RF), and LEAP trained on all features and\\nsequences.\\nThe same models, grid search design, training process, and evaluation procedure as the previous two formulations were used. For RF\\n0-day, 300 trees were used with a maximum depth of 10. For RF, 200 trees were used with a maximum depth of 10. For LEAP, 200\\nhidden units were used for the LSTM input layer, 1000 units for the dense layer input, and 16 units in the penultimate dense layer.\\nInterestingly, for this task, the lw-Misses baseline has almost no predictive power. Conversely, the performance of the lw-Manual\\nheuristic is notable, which simply counts the number of manual doses marked in the first 7 days for each patient. This simple\\nheuristic has almost equivalent predictive power to the machine learning models. This is a valuable insight for health workers,\\nsuggesting that if the worker is already manually marking doses for a patient early in their treatment, the patient is likely to continue\\nto be disengaged with the system in the long term and should be considered for different adherence technology. The RF 0-day model\\nhas decent predictive power, though closer inspection reveals that most of this power is encoded in the treatment center ID – that is,\\nLCFO patients tend to be concentrated at certain treatment centers. This insight merits closer inspection by supervisors about why\\npatients in certain regions tend to be disengaged with 99DOTS but still consuming pills. The RF and LEAP models both perform\\nslightly better than the lw-Manual baseline but similarly to each other, suggesting that the adherence sequence structure does not\\nencode additional information for this prediction task. These insights could improve processes by 1) helping to identify hotspot\\nregions of LCFO patients, after which supervisors might investigate the underlying reason and adjust treatment accordingly at those\\ncenters and 2) the lw-Manual baseline, after only 7 days of dosage data, could give health workers a simple rule for identifying\\nLCFO patients that should switch to different adherence technology.\\n58 Decision Focused Learning\\nThis section delves into a case study illustrating how the LEAP model can be specialized to furnish decision support for a specific\\nintervention. The end-to-end differentiability of the model is utilized to supplant the earlier loss function (binary cross-entropy)\\nwith a performance metric customized to the objective and limitations of a particular decision problem. To realize this end-to-end\\ntraining, recent developments in decision-focused learning are employed, which incorporates an optimization model within the\\nmachine learning training loop.\\nThe focus is on a particular optimization problem that simulates the allocation of health workers to intervene with patients who are\\nat risk in the near future. This proactive intervention is facilitated by the real-time risk predictions and exemplifies how the system\\ncan empower preemptive, focused action by providers. Nonetheless, it is underscored that the system can be readily adapted to\\naccommodate other intervention problems. Such adaptability is one of the advantages of the technical approach, which permits the\\nML model to automatically adjust to the problem delineated by a domain expert.\\nThe optimization problem models a health worker who orchestrates a sequence of interventions throughout a week. The health\\nworker is accountable for a patient population across various locations and may visit one location daily. Location identifiers are\\nemployed at the TB Unit level, as this is the most detailed identifier shared by the majority of patients in the dataset. Visiting a\\nlocation enables the health worker to intervene with any of the patients at that location. The optimization problem involves choosing\\na set of locations to visit that maximizes the number of patients who receive an intervention on or before the first day they would\\nhave missed a dose. This quantity is referred to as the number of successful interventions, which is selected as the objective for two\\nrationales. Firstly, it gauges the degree to which the health worker can proactively engage with patients before adherence declines.\\nSecondly, this objective exclusively counts patients who commence the week at MEDIUM attention and receive an intervention\\nbefore they could have transitioned to HIGH, aligning with the earlier discussion on circumventing unobserved interventions in the\\ndata. This extends the earlier intervention proxy to manage day-by-day rewards.\\nThe optimization problem can be formalized as a linear program. There is a set of locations i = 1, . . . , Land patients j = 1, . . . , N,\\nwhere patient j has location ℓj. Over the days of the week t = 1, . . . ,7, the objective coefficient cjt is 1 if an intervention on day t\\nwith patient j is successful and 0 otherwise. The decision variable is xit, which takes the value 1 if the health worker visits location\\ni on day t and 0 otherwise. With this notation, the final LP is as follows:\\nmax\\n7X\\nt=1\\nNX\\nj=1\\ncjtxℓj ,t\\nsubject to:\\n7X\\nt=1\\nxit ≤ 1 ∀i, x it ∈ {0, 1}.\\nHere, the second constraint prevents the objective from double-counting multiple visits to a location. It is noted that the feasible\\nregion of the LP can be demonstrated to be equivalent to a bipartite matching polytope, implying that the optimal solution is always\\nintegral.\\nThe machine learning task involves predicting the values of cjt, which are unknown at the start of the week. Three models are\\ncompared. Firstly, the lw-Misses baseline is extended to this setting by thresholding the number of doses patient j missed in the last\\nweek, setting cjt = 0 for all t if this value falls below the threshold τ and cjt = 1 otherwise. τ = 1 was used as it performed best.\\nSecondly, the LEAP system was trained directly on the true cjt as a binary prediction task using cross-entropy loss. Thirdly, LEAP\\nwas trained to predict cjt using performance on the above optimization problem as the loss function (training via the differentiable\\nsurrogate). This model is referred to as LEAP-Decision.\\nInstances of the decision problem were created by randomly dividing patients into groups of 100, simulating a health worker under\\nsevere resource limitations (as they would benefit most from such a system). All patients were included, even those with no missed\\ndoses in the last week, since the overall resource allocation problem over locations must still account for them.\\nLEAP and LEAP-Decision both outperform lw-Misses, as anticipated. LEAP-Decision enhances the number of successful\\ninterventions by roughly 15% compared to LEAP, showcasing the merit of customizing the learned model to a given planning\\nproblem. LEAP-Decision actually has a lower AUC than either LEAP or lw-Misses, suggesting that conventional measures of\\nmachine learning accuracy are not an ideal proxy for utility in decision-making. To investigate what specifically distinguishes the\\npredictions made by LEAP-Decision, scatter plots of the predicted utility at each location according to LEAP and LEAP-Decision\\nversus the true values are presented. Visually, LEAP-Decision appears better able to distinguish the high-utility outliers which are\\nmost important to making good decisions. Quantitatively, LEAP-Decision’s predictions have worse correlation with the ground truth\\noverall (0.463, versus 0.519 for LEAP), but better correlation on locations where the true utility is strictly more than 1 (0.504 versus\\n0.409). Hence, decision-focused training incentivizes the model to focus on making accurate predictions specifically for locations\\nthat are likely to be good candidates for an intervention. This demonstrates the benefit of the flexible machine learning modeling\\napproach, which can use custom-defined loss functions to automatically adapt to particular decision problems.\\n6Table 1: Data Summary. *Doses per patient was calculated only on patients enrolled at least 6 months before Sept 2018.\\nMetric Count\\nTotal doses recorded 2,169,976\\n–By patient call 1,459,908\\n–Manual (entered by health worker) 710,068\\nRegistered phones 38,000\\nPatients 16,975\\nHealth centers 252\\nDoses recorded per patient*\\n–Quartiles 57/149/188\\n–Min/Mean/Max 1/136/1409\\nActive patients per center per month\\n–Quartiles 7/18/35\\n–Min/Mean/Max 1/25/226\\nTable 2: LEAP vs. Baseline - Missed Doses Caught\\nMethod True Positives Doses Caught\\nBaseline 204 204\\nLEAP 248 360\\nImprovement 21.6% 76.5%\\nTable 3: LEAP vs. Baseline: Additional Interventions\\nTPR Baseline FPR LEAP FPR Improvement\\n75% 50% 35% 30%\\n80% 63% 41% 35%\\n90% 82% 61% 26%\\n7'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Detecting and Summarizing Video Highlights with\\nLag-Calibration\\nAbstract\\nThe increasing popularity of video sharing has led to a growing need for automatic\\nvideo analysis, including highlight detection. Emerging platforms that feature\\ncrowdsourced, time-synchronized video comments offer a valuable resource for\\nidentifying video highlights. However, this task presents several challenges: (1)\\ntime-synchronized comments often lag behind their corresponding shots; (2) these\\ncomments are frequently sparse and contain noise semantically; and (3) determining\\nwhich shots constitute highlights is inherently subjective. This paper introduces\\na novel framework designed to address these challenges. The proposed method\\nuses concept-mapped lexical chains to calibrate the lag in comments, models\\nvideo highlights based on comment intensity and the combined concentration\\nof emotion and concept within each shot, and summarizes detected highlights\\nusing an enhanced SumBasic algorithm that incorporates emotion and concept\\nmapping. Experiments conducted on extensive real-world datasets demonstrate\\nthat our highlight detection and summarization methods substantially outperform\\nexisting benchmark techniques.\\n1 Introduction\\nBillions of hours of video content are viewed daily on platforms like YouTube, with mobile devices\\naccounting for half of these views. This surge in video sharing has intensified the demand for efficient\\nvideo analysis. Consider a scenario where a user wishes to quickly grasp the essence of a lengthy\\nvideo without manually navigating through it. Automatically generated highlights would enable\\nusers to digest the video’s key moments in a matter of minutes, aiding their decision on whether to\\nwatch the full video later. Furthermore, automated video highlight detection and summarization can\\nsignificantly enhance video indexing, search, and recommendation systems.\\nHowever, extracting highlights from a video is a complex task. Firstly, the perception of a \"highlight\"\\ncan vary significantly among individuals. Secondly, analyzing low-level features such as image, audio,\\nand motion may not always capture the essence of a highlight. The absence of high-level semantic\\ninformation poses a significant limitation to highlight detection in conventional video processing.\\nThe recent emergence of crowdsourced, time-synchronized video comments, also known as \"bullet-\\nscreen comments,\" presents a new avenue for highlight detection. These real-time comments, which\\nappear overlaid on the video screen, are synchronized with the video frames. This phenomenon has\\ngained widespread popularity on platforms like niconico in Japan, Bilibili and Acfun in China, and\\nYouTube Live and Twitch Live in the USA. The prevalence of time-synchronized comments offers a\\nunique opportunity for leveraging natural language processing in video highlight detection.\\nNevertheless, using time-synchronized comments for highlight detection and labeling still poses\\nsignificant challenges. Primarily, there is an almost unavoidable delay between comments and their\\ncorresponding shots. As illustrated in Figure 1, discussions about a particular shot may continue\\ninto subsequent shots. Highlight detection and labeling without accounting for this lag may yield\\ninaccurate outcomes. Secondly, time-synchronized comments are often semantically sparse, both\\nin terms of the number of comments per shot and the number of words per comment. This sparsitycan hinder the performance of traditional bag-of-words statistical models. Thirdly, determining\\nhighlights in an unsupervised manner, without prior knowledge, involves considerable uncertainty.\\nThe defining characteristics of highlights must be clearly defined, captured, and modeled to ensure\\naccurate detection.\\nTo our knowledge, limited research has focused on unsupervised highlight detection and labeling\\nusing time-synchronized comments. The most relevant work in this area proposes detecting highlights\\nbased on the topic concentration derived from semantic vectors of bullet-comments, and labeling each\\nhighlight using a pre-trained classifier based on predefined tags. However, we contend that emotion\\nconcentration holds greater significance than general topic concentration in highlight detection.\\nAnother study suggests extracting highlights based on the frame-by-frame similarity of emotion\\ndistributions. However, neither of these approaches addresses the combined challenges of lag\\ncalibration, balancing emotion-topic concentration, and unsupervised highlight labeling.\\nTo overcome these challenges, this study proposes the following solutions: (1) employ word-to-\\nconcept and word-to-emotion mapping based on global word embedding, enabling the construction of\\nlexical chains for calibrating the lag in bullet-comments; (2) detect highlights based on the emotional\\nand conceptual concentration and intensity of the lag-calibrated bullet-comments; and (3) summarize\\nhighlights using a modified Basic Sum algorithm that considers emotions and concepts as fundamental\\nunits within a bullet-comment.\\nThe main contributions of this research are as follows: (1) We introduce a completely unsupervised\\nframework for detecting and summarizing video highlights using time-synchronized comments;\\n(2) We introduce a lag-calibration method that uses concept-mapped lexical chains; (3) We have\\ncreated extensive datasets for bullet-comment word embedding, an emotion lexicon tailored for\\nbullet-comments, and ground-truth data for evaluating highlight detection and labeling based on\\nbullet-comments.\\n2 Related Work\\n2.1 Highlight detection by video processing\\nFollowing the definition from previous research, we define highlights as the most memorable shots in\\na video characterized by high emotional intensity. It’s important to note that highlight detection differs\\nfrom video summarization. While video summarization aims to provide a condensed representation\\nof a video’s storyline, highlight detection focuses on extracting its emotionally impactful content.\\nIn the realm of highlight detection, some researchers have proposed representing video emotions as a\\ncurve on the arousal-valence plane, utilizing low-level features such as motion, vocal effects, shot\\nlength, and audio pitch, or color, along with mid-level features like laughter and subtitles. However,\\ndue to the semantic gap between low-level features and high-level semantics, the accuracy of highlight\\ndetection based solely on video processing is limited.\\n2.2 Temporal text summarization\\nResearch on temporal text summarization shares similarities with the present study but also exhibits\\nkey distinctions. Several works have approached temporal text summarization as a constrained\\nmulti-objective optimization problem, a graph optimization problem, a supervised learning-to-rank\\nproblem, and as an online clustering problem.\\nThis study models highlight detection as a simpler two-objective optimization problem with specific\\nconstraints. However, the features employed to assess the \"highlightness\" of a shot diverge from\\nthose used in the aforementioned studies. Given that highlight shots are observed to correlate with\\nhigh emotional intensity and topic concentration, coverage and non-redundancy are not primary\\noptimization goals, as they are in temporal text summarization. Instead, our focus is on modeling\\nemotional and topic concentration within the context of this study.\\n2.3 Crowdsourced time-sync comment mining\\nSeveral studies have explored the use of crowdsourced time-synchronized comments for tagging\\nvideos on a shot-by-shot basis. These approaches involve manual labeling and supervised training,\\n2temporal and personalized topic modeling, or tagging the video as a whole. One work proposes\\ngenerating a summarization for each shot through data reconstruction that jointly considers textual\\nand topic levels.\\nOne work proposed a centroid-diffusion algorithm to identify highlights. Shots are represented by\\nlatent topics found through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Another method suggests using pre-\\ntrained semantic vectors of comments to cluster them into topics and subsequently identify highlights\\nbased on topic concentration. Additionally, they utilize predefined labels to train a classifier for\\nhighlight labeling. The current study differs from these two studies in several ways. First, before\\nperforming highlight detection, we apply a lag-calibration step to mitigate inaccuracies caused\\nby comment delays. Second, we represent each scene using a combination of topic and emotion\\nconcentration. Third, we perform both highlight detection and labeling in an unsupervised manner.\\n2.4 Lexical chain\\nLexical chains represent sequences of words that exhibit a cohesive relationship spanning multiple\\nsentences. Early work on lexical chains used syntactic relationships of words from Roget’s Thesaurus,\\nwithout considering word sense disambiguation. Subsequent research expanded lexical chains by\\nincorporating WordNet relations and word sense disambiguation. Lexical chains are also built\\nutilizing word-embedded relations for disambiguating multi-word expressions. This study constructs\\nlexical chains for accurate lag calibration, leveraging global word embedding.\\n3 Problem Formulation\\nThe problem addressed in this paper can be formulated as follows: The input consists of a set of\\ntime-synchronized comments, denoted as C = {c1, c2, c3, . . . , cn}, along with their correspond-\\ning timestamps T = {t1, t2, t3, . . . , tn} for a given video v. We are also given a compression\\nratio ρhighlight that determines the number of highlights to be generated, and a compression ratio\\nρsummary that specifies the number of comments to be included in each highlight summary. Our\\nobjective is twofold: (1) to generate a set of highlight shots S(v) = {s1, s2, s3, . . . , sm}, and (2)\\nto produce highlight summaries Σ(v) = {C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cm} that closely align with the ground\\ntruth. Each highlight summary Ci comprises a subset of the comments associated with that shot:\\nCi = {c1, c2, c3, . . . , ck}. The number of highlight shots m and the number of comments in each\\nsummary k are determined by ρhighlight and ρsummary, respectively.\\n4 Video Highlight Detection\\nThis section introduces our proposed framework for detecting video highlights. We also describe\\ntwo preliminary tasks: constructing a global word embedding for time-synchronized comments and\\nbuilding an emotion lexicon.\\n4.1 Preliminaries\\nWord-Embedding of Time-Sync Comments\\nAs previously highlighted, a key challenge in analyzing time-synchronized comments is their semantic\\nsparsity, stemming from the limited number of comments and their brevity. Two semantically related\\nwords might not appear related if they don’t co-occur frequently within a single video. To address this,\\nwe construct a global word embedding based on a large collection of time-synchronized comments.\\nThis word-embedding dictionary can be represented as: D = {(w1 : v1), (w2 : v2), . . . ,(wn : vn)},\\nwhere wi is a word, vi is its corresponding word vector, and n is the vocabulary size of the corpus.\\nEmotion Lexicon Construction\\nExtracting emotions from time-synchronized comments is crucial for highlight detection, as em-\\nphasized earlier. However, traditional emotion lexicons are not directly applicable in this context\\ndue to the prevalence of internet slang specific to these platforms. For example, \"23333\" signifies\\nlaughter (\"ha ha ha\"), and \"6666\" expresses admiration (\"really awesome\"). Therefore, we construct\\nan emotion lexicon tailored for time-synchronized comments, derived from the word-embedding\\n3dictionary generated in the previous step. We begin by manually labeling words corresponding to\\nthe five basic emotion categories (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, and surprise) as seeds, selecting\\nfrom the most frequent words in the corpus. The sixth emotion category, \"disgust,\" is omitted due\\nto its rarity in the dataset but can be easily incorporated for other datasets. We then expand this\\nemotion lexicon by identifying the top N neighbors of each seed word in the word-embedding space.\\nA neighbor is added to the seeds if it meets a minimum percentage of overlap θoverlap with all seeds,\\nwith a minimum similarity score of simmin. Neighbors are determined based on cosine similarity\\nwithin the word-embedding space.\\n4.2 Lag-Calibration\\nThis section details our method for lag calibration, which involves concept mapping, constructing\\nword-embedded lexical chains, and performing the actual calibration.\\nConcept Mapping\\nTo tackle semantic sparsity in time-synchronized comments and build lexical chains of semantically\\nrelated words, we first map words with similar meanings to the same concept. Given a set of\\ncomments C for a video v, we define a mapping F from the vocabulary VC of comments C to a set of\\nconcepts KC:\\nF : VC → KC (|VC| ≥ |KC|)\\nSpecifically, the mapping F assigns each word wi to a concept k = F(wi) as follows:\\nF(wi) = F(w1) = F(w2) = . . .= F(wtop_n) = k, ∃k ∈ KC\\ns.t. {w|w ∈ top_n(wi) ∧ F(w) = k}/|top_n(wi)| ≥θoverlap\\ntop_n(wi) returns the n nearest neighbors of word wi based on cosine similarity. For each word wi\\nin the comments C, we examine the percentage of its neighbors that have already been mapped to\\na concept k. If this percentage exceeds the threshold θoverlap, then word wi and its neighbors are\\nmapped to concept k. Otherwise, they are assigned to a new concept, represented by wi itself.\\nLexical Chain Construction\\nThe next step involves constructing all lexical chains present in the time-synchronized comments for\\nvideo v. This enables the calibration of lagged comments based on these chains. A lexical chain lik\\nconsists of a set of triples lik = {(w, t, c)}, where w is the actual word mentioned for concept k in\\ncomment c, and t is the timestamp of comment c. We create a lexical chain dictionary LC for the\\ntime-synchronized comments C of video v:\\nLC = {k1 : (l11, l12, l13, . . .), k2 : (l21, l22, l23, . . .), . . . , kn : (ln1, ln2, ln3, . . .)}\\nwhere ki ∈ KC represents a concept, and lik is the i-th lexical chain associated with concept k. The\\nprocedure for constructing these lexical chains is detailed in Algorithm 1.\\nSpecifically, each comment in C can either be appended to an existing lexical chain or added to a\\nnew, empty chain. This decision is based on the comment’s temporal distance from existing chains,\\ncontrolled by the maximum silence parameter tsilence.\\nIt’s important to note that word senses within the constructed lexical chains are not disambiguated,\\nunlike in most traditional algorithms. However, we argue that these lexical chains remain useful\\nbecause our concept mapping is built from time-synchronized comments in their natural order.\\nThis progressive semantic continuity naturally reinforces similar word senses for temporally close\\ncomments. This continuity, combined with global word embedding, ensures the validity of our\\nconcept mapping in most scenarios.\\nComment Lag-Calibration\\nWith the lexical chain dictionary LC constructed, we can now calibrate the comments in C based on\\ntheir respective lexical chains. Our observations indicate that the initial comment pertaining to a\\nshot typically occurs within that shot, while subsequent comments may not. Therefore, we adjust\\nthe timestamp of each comment to match the timestamp of the first element within its corresponding\\nlexical chain. If a comment belongs to multiple lexical chains (concepts), we select the chain with the\\nhighest score scorechain. The scorechain is calculated as the sum of the frequencies of each word\\n4in the chain, weighted by the logarithm of their global frequencies, denoted as log(D(w).count).\\nConsequently, each comment will be assigned to its most semantically significant lexical chain\\n(concept) for calibration. The calibration algorithm is presented in Algorithm 2.\\nIt’s worth noting that if multiple consecutive shots, {s1, s2, . . . , sn}, contain comments with similar\\ncontent, our lag-calibration method might shift many comments from shots s2, s3, . . . , sn to the\\ntimestamp of the first shot, s1, if these comments are connected through lexical chains originating\\nfrom s1. This is not necessarily a drawback, as it helps us avoid selecting redundant consecutive\\nhighlight shots and allows for the inclusion of other potential highlights, given a fixed compression\\nratio.\\n4.3 Shot Importance Scoring\\nIn this section, we first segment comments into shots of equal temporal length, denoted as tshot. We\\nthen model the importance of each shot, enabling highlight detection based on these importance\\nscores.\\nA shot’s importance is modeled as a function of two factors: comment concentration and commenting\\nintensity. Regarding comment concentration, as mentioned earlier, both concept and emotional\\nconcentration contribute to highlight detection. For instance, a cluster of concept-concentrated\\ncomments like \"the background music/bgm/soundtrack of this shot is classic/inspiring/the best\" could\\nindicate a highlight related to memorable background music. Similarly, comments such as \"this plot\\nis so funny/hilarious/lmao/lol/2333\" might suggest a highlight characterized by a single concentrated\\nemotion. Therefore, our model combines these two types of concentration. We define the emotional\\nconcentration Cemotion(Cs) of shot s based on time-synchronized comments Cs and the emotion\\nlexicon E as follows:\\nCemotion(Cs) = 1 − P|E|\\ne=1 pe log(pe)\\npe = |{w|w∈Cs∧w∈E(e)}|\\n|Cs|\\nHere, we calculate the inverse of the entropy of probabilities for the five emotions within a shot to\\nrepresent emotion concentration. Next, we define topical concentration Ctopic as:\\nCtopic(Cs) = 1\\nJ\\nPJ\\nj=1 pj log(pj)\\npj =\\nP\\nw∈Cs∩F(kj)\\n1\\nlog(D(w))\\nP\\nw∈Cs\\n1\\nlog(D(w))\\nwhere we calculate the inverse of the entropy of all concepts within a shot to represent topic\\nconcentration. The probability of each concept k is determined by the sum of the frequencies of\\nits mentioned words, weighted by their global frequencies, and then divided by the sum of these\\nweighted frequencies for all words in the shot.\\nNow, the comment importance Icomment(Cs, s) of shot s can be defined as:\\nIcomment(Cs, s) = λ · Cemotion(Cs, s) + (1− λ) · Ctopic(Cs, s)\\nwhere λ is a hyperparameter that controls the balance between emotion and concept concentration.\\nFinally, the overall importance of a shot is defined as:\\nI(Cs, s) = Icomment(Cs, s) · log(|Cs|)\\nwhere |Cs| represents the total length of all time-synchronized comments within shot s, serving as a\\nstraightforward yet effective indicator of comment intensity per shot.\\nThe problem of highlight detection can now be formulated as a maximization problem:\\nMaximize P\\ns∈S I(Cs, s)\\nSubject to |S| ≤ρhighlight · N\\n55 Video Highlight Summarization\\nGiven a set of detected highlight shots S(v) = {s1, s2, s3, . . . , sm} for video v, each associated with\\nits lag-calibrated comments Cs, our goal is to generate summaries Σ(v) = {C1, C2, C3, . . . , Cm}\\nsuch that Ci ⊂ Csi, with a compression ratio of ρsummary, and Ci closely resembles the ground\\ntruth.\\nWe propose a simple yet highly effective summarization model, building upon SumBasic with\\nenhancements that incorporate emotion and concept mapping, along with a two-level updating\\nmechanism.\\nIn our modified SumBasic, instead of solely down-weighting the probabilities of words in a selected\\nsentence to mitigate redundancy, we down-weight the probabilities of both words and their mapped\\nconcepts to re-weight each comment. This two-level updating approach achieves two key objectives:\\n(1) it penalizes the selection of sentences containing semantically similar words, and (2) it allows for\\nthe selection of a sentence with a word already present in the summary if that word occurs significantly\\nmore frequently. Additionally, we introduce an emotion bias parameter,bemotion, to weight words\\nand concepts during probability calculations. This increases the frequencies of emotional words and\\nconcepts by a factor of bemotion compared to non-emotional ones.\\n6 Experiment\\nThis section presents the experiments conducted on large-scale real-world datasets to evaluate\\nhighlight detection and summarization. We describe the data collection process, evaluation metrics,\\nbenchmark methods, and experimental results.\\n6.1 Data\\nThis section describes the datasets collected and constructed for our experiments. All datasets and\\ncode will be made publicly available on Github.\\nCrowdsourced Time-sync Comment Corpus\\nTo train the word embedding described earlier, we collected a large corpus of time-synchronized\\ncomments from Bilibili, a content-sharing website in China that features such comments. The corpus\\ncomprises 2,108,746 comments, 15,179,132 tokens, and 91,745 unique tokens, extracted from 6,368\\nlong videos. On average, each comment contains 7.20 tokens.\\nBefore training, each comment undergoes tokenization using the Chinese word tokenization package\\nJieba. Repeated characters within words, such as \"233333,\" \"66666,\" and \" ˘54c8˘54c8˘54c8˘54c8,\" are\\nreplaced with two instances of the same character.\\nThe word embedding is trained using word2vec with the skip-gram model. We set the number of\\nembedding dimensions to 300, the window size to 7, and the down-sampling rate to 1e-3. Words with\\na frequency lower than 3 are discarded.\\nEmotion Lexicon Construction\\nAfter training the word embedding, we manually select emotional words belonging to the five basic\\nemotion categories from the 500 most frequent words in the embedding. We then iteratively expand\\nthese emotion seeds using Algorithm 1. After each expansion iteration, we manually review the\\nexpanded lexicon, removing any inaccurate words to prevent concept drift. The filtered expanded\\nseeds are then used for further expansion in the next round. The minimum overlap θoverlap is set to\\n0.05, and the minimum similarity simmin is set to 0.6. These values are determined through a grid\\nsearch within the range of [0, 1]. The number of words for each emotion, both initially and after the\\nfinal expansion, is presented in Table 3.\\nVideo Highlights Data\\nTo evaluate our highlight detection algorithm, we constructed a ground-truth dataset. This dataset\\nleverages user-uploaded mixed-clips related to a specific video on Bilibili. Mixed-clips represent a\\ncollection of video highlights chosen according to the user’s preferences. We then consider the most\\nfrequently selected highlights as the ground truth for a given video.\\n6Table 1: Number of Initial and Expanded Emotion Words\\nHappy Sad Fear Anger Surprise\\nSeeds 17 13 19 21 14\\nAll 157 235 258 284 226\\nThe dataset consists of 11 videos totaling 1333 minutes in length, with 75,653 time-synchronized\\ncomments. For each video, 3-4 video mix-clips are collected from Bilibili. Shots that appear in at\\nleast two of these mix-clips are considered ground-truth highlights. These highlights are mapped to\\nthe original video timeline, and their start and end times are recorded as ground truth. Mix-clips are\\nselected based on the following criteria: (1) they are found on Bilibili using the search query \"video\\ntitle + mixed clips\"; (2) they are sorted by play count in descending order; (3) they primarily focus on\\nvideo highlights rather than a plot-by-plot summary or gist; (4) they are under 10 minutes in length;\\nand (5) they contain a mix of several highlight shots instead of just one.\\nOn average, each video contains 24.3 highlight shots. The mean duration of these highlight shots is\\n27.79 seconds, while the mode is 8 and 10 seconds (with a frequency of 19).\\nHighlights Summarization Data\\nWe also created a highlight summarization (labeling) dataset for the 11 videos. For each highlight\\nshot and its associated comments, we asked annotators to create a summary by selecting as many\\ncomments as they deemed necessary. The guiding principles were: (1) comments with identical\\nmeanings should not be selected more than once; (2) the most representative comment among similar\\ncomments should be chosen; and (3) comments that stand out and are irrelevant to the current\\ndiscussion should be discarded.\\nAcross the 11 videos and 267 highlights, each highlight has an average of 3.83 comments in its\\nsummary.\\n6.2 Evaluation Metrics\\nThis section introduces the evaluation metrics employed for both highlight detection and summariza-\\ntion.\\nVideo Highlight Detection Evaluation\\nTo evaluate video highlight detection, we need to define a \"hit\" between a candidate highlight and a\\nreference highlight. A strict definition would require a perfect match between the start and end times\\nof the candidate and reference highlights. However, this criterion is overly stringent for any model.\\nA more lenient definition would consider an overlap between a candidate and a reference highlight.\\nHowever, this can still underestimate model performance, as users’ choices of highlight start and end\\ntimes can sometimes be arbitrary. Instead, we define a \"hit\" with a relaxation parameter δ between a\\ncandidate h and the reference set R as follows:\\nhit(h, R) = {1 ∃r ∈ R : (sh, eh) ∩ (sr − δ, er + δ) ̸= ∅\\n0otherwise\\nwhere sh, eh represent the start and end times of highlight h, and δ is the relaxation length applied to\\nthe reference set R. We can then define precision, recall, and F1-score as:\\nP recision(H, R) =\\nP\\nh∈H hit(h,R)\\n|H|\\nRecall(H, R) =\\nP\\nr∈R hit(r,H)\\n|R|\\nF1(H, R) = 2·Precision (H,R)·Recall(H,R)\\nPrecision (H,R)+Recall(H,R)\\nIn this study, we set the relaxation length δ to 5 seconds. The candidate highlight length is set to 15\\nseconds.\\nVideo Highlight Summarization Evaluation\\nWe utilize ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 as recall metrics for evaluating candidate summaries:\\n7ROUGE − n(C, R) =\\nP\\nr∈R\\nP\\nn−gram∈r Countmatch(n−gram)P\\nr∈R\\nP\\nn−gram∈r Count(n−gram)\\nWe employ BLEU-1 and BLEU-2 as precision metrics. BLEU is chosen for two reasons. First, a\\nnaive precision metric would be biased towards shorter comments, and BLEU mitigates this with the\\nBP (Brevity Penalty) factor:\\nBLEU − n(C, R) = BP ·\\nP\\nc∈C\\nP\\nn−gram∈c Countclip(n−gram)P\\nc∈C\\nP\\nn−gram∈c Count(n−gram)\\nBP = {1 if|C| > |R|\\ne(1−|R|/|C|)if|C| ≤ |R|\\nwhere C is the candidate summary and R is the reference summary. Second, while the reference\\nsummary contains no redundancy, the candidate summary might incorrectly select multiple similar\\ncomments that match the same keywords in the reference. In such cases, precision would be\\nsignificantly overestimated. BLEU addresses this by counting matches one-by-one; the number of\\nmatches for a word will be the minimum of its frequencies in the candidate and reference summaries.\\nFinally, the F1-score is defined as:\\nF1 − n(C, R) = 2·BLEU −n(C,R)·ROUGE −n(C,R)\\nBLEU −n(C,R)+ROUGE −n(C,R)\\n6.3 Benchmark methods\\nBenchmarks for Video Highlight Detection\\nFor highlight detection, we compare different combinations of our model against three benchmark\\nmethods:\\n* **Random-Selection:** Highlight shots are randomly selected from all shots in a video. *\\n**Uniform-Selection:** Highlight shots are selected at equal intervals. * **Spike-Selection:** High-\\nlight shots are chosen based on the highest number of comments within the shot. * **Spike+E+T:**\\nThis is our method, incorporating emotion and topic concentration but without lag calibration. *\\n**Spike+L:** This is our method, including only the lag-calibration step and not considering content\\nconcentration. * **Spike+L+E+T:** This represents our full model.\\nBenchmarks for Video Highlight Summarization\\nFor highlight summarization, we compare our method against five benchmark methods:\\n* **SumBasic:** Summarization that relies solely on frequency for summary construction. * **Latent\\nSemantic Analysis (LSA):** Text summarization based on singular value decomposition (SVD)\\nfor latent topic discovery. * **LexRank:** Graph-based summarization that calculates sentence\\nimportance using the concept of eigenvector centrality in a sentence graph. * **KL-Divergence:**\\nSummarization based on minimizing KL-divergence between the summary and the source corpus,\\nemploying a greedy search approach. * **Luhn method:** A heuristic summarization method that\\nconsiders both word frequency and sentence position within an article.\\n6.4 Experiment Results\\nThis section presents the experimental results for both highlight detection and highlight summariza-\\ntion.\\nResults of Highlight Detection\\nIn our highlight detection model, the maximum silence threshold for lexical chains, tsilence, is set\\nto 11 seconds. The threshold for concept mapping, θoverlap, is set to 0.5. The number of neighbors\\nconsidered for concept mapping, top_n, is set to 15. The parameter λ, which controls the balance\\nbetween emotion and concept concentration, is set to 0.9. A detailed parameter analysis is provided\\nin Section 7.\\nTable 4 presents the precision, recall, and F1-scores for different combinations of our method and the\\nbenchmark methods. Our full model (Spike+L+E+T) outperforms all other benchmarks across all\\nmetrics. Random and uniform selection exhibit low precision and recall, as they don’t incorporate\\nstructural or content information. Spike-selection shows significant improvement by leveraging\\n8comment intensity. However, not all comment-intensive shots are highlights. For example, comments\\nat the beginning and end of a video are often high-volume greetings or goodbyes, which may not be\\nindicative of highlights. Additionally, spike-selection tends to cluster highlights within consecutive\\nshots with high comment volumes. In contrast, our method can identify less intensive but emotionally\\nor conceptually concentrated shots that might be missed by spike-selection. This is evident in the\\nperformance of Spike+E+T.\\nWe also observe that lag calibration alone (Spike+L) considerably enhances the performance of\\nSpike-selection, partially supporting our hypothesis that lag calibration is crucial for tasks involving\\ntime-synchronized comments.\\nTable 2: Comparison of Highlight Detection Methods\\nMethod Precision Recall F1-score\\nRandom-Selection 0.1578 0.1567 0.1587\\nUniform-Selection 0.1797 0.1830 0.1775\\nSpike-Selection 0.2594 0.2167 0.2321\\nSpike+E+T 0.2796 0.2357 0.2500\\nSpike+L 0.3125 0.2690 0.2829\\nSpike+L+E+T 0.3099 0.3071 0.3066\\nResults of Highlight Summarization\\nIn our highlight summarization model, the emotion bias bemotion is set to 0.3.\\nTable 5 compares the 1-gram BLEU, ROUGE, and F1-scores of our method and the benchmark\\nmethods.

       "  'file_content': 'Controlling False Discovery Rates in Detecting Heterogeneous\\nTreatment Effects for Online Experiments\\nAbstract\\nOnline controlled experiments, commonly referred to as A/B testing, are widely used in many Internet companies\\nfor data-driven decision-making regarding feature modifications and product releases. However, a significant\\nchallenge remains in methodically evaluating how each code or feature change affects millions of users who\\nexhibit considerable heterogeneity across various dimensions such as countries, ages, and devices. The Average\\nTreatment Effect (ATE) framework, which is the foundation of the A/B testing approach used by many companies,\\nis unable to identify the heterogeneity of treatment effects on users with varying characteristics. This paper\\nintroduces statistical techniques designed to systematically and precisely pinpoint the Heterogeneous Treatment\\nEffect (HTE) within any specific user cohort, like mobile device type or country. Additionally, these methods help\\ndetermine which user factors, such as age or gender, contribute to the variability in treatment effects observed\\nduring an A/B test. Through the application of these methods to both simulated and real-world experimental\\ndata, we demonstrate their robust performance in maintaining a controlled, low False Discovery Rate (FDR).\\nSimultaneously, they offer valuable insights into the heterogeneity of identified user groups. We have implemented\\na toolkit based on these methods and utilized it to assess the HTE across numerous A/B tests at Snap.\\n1 Introduction\\nControlled experiments, also known as A/B testing, have become a standard method for assessing and enhancing new product\\nconcepts across internet companies. Numerous IT companies, possessing extensive and large-scale data, have developed internal\\nA/B testing platforms to address their intricate experimentation requirements. At Snap, the utilization of A/B testing has substantially\\nincreased in the last two years. The in-house platform currently manages hundreds of concurrent experiments at any moment. Each\\nexperiment automatically generates results for hundreds to thousands of varied online metrics.\\nAs experimentation gains popularity, there is an increasing demand for experimenters to understand not only the overall impact\\non metrics in an A/B test but also the reasons behind metric changes and the specific user segments driving these changes. Such\\ninsights into user heterogeneity can assist experimenters in devising strategies to enhance the product. For instance, in a recent\\nexperiment, we observed that a decline in a metric was primarily influenced by users with the highest number of snap views. This\\nobservation led us to concentrate on understanding the engineering and design aspects when a user has a large number of snap stacks\\nto load. Consequently, we were able to pinpoint a significant performance problem that was causing the metric to drop. Indeed, we\\nhave encountered numerous instances where users react differently to the same experimental treatment.\\nFurthermore, the abundance of data presents a significant risk of false discoveries, often due to a statistical phenomenon referred to\\nas \"multiple testing\". Given the hundreds of thousands of user characteristics available to internet companies, user groups can be\\nformed in millions of different ways. If a \"naive\" approach is taken, simply calculating and comparing the estimated effect based on\\nusers within groups, it is easy to find groups with treatment effects that significantly deviate from the average, regardless of whether\\nactual heterogeneity exists.\\nThe objective of our work is to bridge this gap by offering rigorous statistical methods and a toolkit capable of detecting Heterogeneous\\nTreatment Effects (HTE) while addressing the potential issue of multiple testing by controlling the false positive rate (FDR). This\\ntoolkit has been deployed and is in use at Snap. In this paper, we explore the rationale for using FDR and contrast two statistical\\nmethods that manage FDR, using both simulated results and actual experimental data. Based on the methods selected, we will\\ndiscuss solutions to two questions that experimenters and practitioners are keen to understand regarding HTE:\\n• How to systematically identify which subgroups of users (e.g., countries) exhibit treatment effects significantly different\\nfrom the Average Treatment Effect in an A/B test.\\n• How to rigorously determine which factors (e.g., age, gender) contribute to the heterogeneity of the treatment effect in an\\nA/B test.\\nOur contributions in this paper are summarized as follows:• We frame the HTE detection problem as an FDR control issue and elaborate on why controlling FDR is crucial in large-scale\\nHTE detection in practical applications.\\n• We employ two methods capable of controlling FDR in our HTE detection process and provide insightful comparisons of\\nthese methods using both simulation and real-world empirical data.\\n• We discuss two significant lessons learned, concerning (1) the distinction between heterogeneity in the population and\\nheterogeneity in treatment effects, and (2) the scalability of the algorithms. These insights are intended to help practitioners\\navoid similar pitfalls.\\n2 Methodology\\n2.1 Average Treatment Effect vs. Heterogeneous Treatment Effect\\nIn an A/B test, users are randomly divided into a treatment group and a control group, and the metrics of interest are observed\\nfor all users. The Rubin Causal Model is frequently employed in A/B testing as a statistical framework for causal inference. Let\\nYi(Ti) represent the potential outcome for the i-th user, where Ti = 1 if the i-th user is in the treatment group and Ti = 0 if the i-th\\nuser is in the control group. Consequently, τi = Yi(1) − Yi(0) denotes the causal effect of the treatment for the i-th unit, and the\\naverage causal effect across all users, ¯τ, is defined as the Average Treatment Effect (ATE). It is important to note that the ATE is\\nnot directly observable since Yi(0) and Yi(1) cannot be known simultaneously. This is recognized as the \"fundamental problem of\\ncausal inference\". However, the estimator Yi|Ti = 1 − Yi|Ti = 0 is unbiased for the ATE when two specific assumptions are met\\nand is commonly used to estimate the ATE in A/B testing.\\nAssumption 1. Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTV A):\\n• There is only one version of treatment and control, meaning there is only one version of T = 1 and T = 0.\\n• The treatment applied to one user does not affect the outcome of another user (no interference).\\nAssumption 2. Unconfoundedness: Ti is independent of (Yi(0), Yi(1)) given Xi, where Xi is a set of pre-treatment variables for the\\ni-th user, such as age, gender, country, etc.\\nHowever, analysis based solely on ATE is sometimes insufficient for obtaining precise and meaningful insights. As mentioned earlier,\\nwe have observed numerous cases where a single feature change can impact different users differently. The estimation of ATE is\\nnot an effective measure for a heterogeneous population, as it may exaggerate the treatment effect for one sub-population while\\nunderestimating it for another. To investigate heterogeneous treatment effects, it is necessary to consider the conditional average\\ntreatment effect, defined as: τ(x) = E[Yi(1) − Yi(0)|Xi = x], where Xi represents a set of pre-treatment variables for the i-th user.\\nAccurately estimating the conditional average treatment effectτ(x) for all values ofx is highly beneficial for detecting heterogeneous\\ntreatment effects because τ(x) provides the conditional average treatment effect for the subpopulation defined by the covariatesx.\\nFor instance, if the covariate is ’country’, the covariate space can be partitioned into countries, and τ(x) represents the conditional\\naverage treatment effect for users in country x. If τ(x) is statistically different from the average treatment effect ¯τ, then country x is\\nconsidered heterogeneous.\\nThere is a growing need for rigorous analysis based on heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE), which motivates us to develop a\\nrobust statistical approach for HTE detection.\\n2.2 Naive Approaches and their Caveats\\nIn this section, we outline some prevalent practices used by practitioners that could result in the spurious discovery of HTE. Suppose\\nwe have users from various countries and wish to identify which countries exhibit treatment effects different from the ATE for a\\nparticular metric. A straightforward approach to detect heterogeneous countries involves first conducting a two-sample t-test on the\\nobservations from each country to obtain a two-sided p-value for each country, and then selecting countries with a p-value less than\\n0.05 as the result. We will refer to this method as the \"naive approach\".\\nThis naive approach is simple and may appear intuitive to non-statisticians. However, it is susceptible to the multiple testing problem.\\nWe demonstrate this issue with a basic simulation:\\n• Step 1: Assess treatment effects for all users in 30 randomly generated subgroups from a standard Gaussian distribution,\\nensuring the true ATE is zero.\\n• Step 2: Implement the naive approach and identify subgroups with p-values below 0.05 as heterogeneous.\\nIn this simulation, 3 out of 30 subgroups are identified as having heterogeneous treatment effects, despite the ATE estimator being 0,\\nindicating no actual heterogeneity among the subgroups.\\nThe Bonferroni correction method can be employed to address the multiple testing problem by controlling the family-wise error rate\\n(FWER). The FWER is the probability of rejecting at least one true hypothesis. Nevertheless, the Bonferroni method is known to be\\n2highly conservative, resulting in a high rate of false negatives and low statistical power, defined as P(rejectH0 | H1), where H0 is\\nthe null hypothesis and H1 is the alternative hypothesis.\\n2.3 False Discovery Rate Controlled HTE Detection\\nDue to the limitations of the methods discussed in the previous section, we introduce methods for HTE detection that address\\nthe multiple testing problem while maintaining sufficient statistical power. To manage the multiple testing issue and reduce\\nconservativeness, Benjamini and Hochberg introduced the concept of the false discovery rate (FDR), which is defined as follows:\\nDefinition 3.1. False Discovery Rate: Let Q be the proportion of false positives among all detected (rejections of the null hypothesis).\\nThen F DR= E[Q].\\nTo control the FDR, it is necessary to manage the expected proportion of discoveries that are false. Additionally, methods that control\\nthe FDR are generally much less conservative than the Bonferroni method. Therefore, in our proposed HTE detection approach, we\\ncan control the FDR and ensure adequate power simultaneously.\\n2.4 Detection for Heterogeneous Subgroups\\nWhen conducting an A/B testing experiment, it is often important to identify which subgroups of users exhibit treatment effects\\ndifferent from the ATE. For example, at Snap, with users from over 200 countries, we are interested in determining which countries\\nhave higher or lower treatment effects compared to the average for the metric of interest.\\nIn this process, it is crucial to minimize the number of false discoveries in our results. To achieve this, we utilize the Benjamini-\\nHochberg (BH) procedure to control the FDR. The BH procedure is known to control the FDR if the test statistics are independent or\\nsatisfy the positive regression dependence on a subset property. It is one of the most widely used FDR control methods due to its\\nsimplicity. For instance, suppose we have p-values from m independent hypothesis tests H1, ..., Hm ranked in ascending order:\\np(1), ..., p(m), and we aim to control the FDR at level q. The BH procedure identifies the largest k such that p(k) ≤ k\\nm q and rejects\\nthe null hypothesis for all H(i) where i ≤ k. By doing so, it theoretically ensures that the FDR is controlled below q.\\nTo detect heterogeneous subgroups, it is necessary to estimate the conditional average treatment effects defined in equation (3) for\\nthe subgroups. Although individual treatment effect values are not available due to the fundamental problem of causal inference, we\\ncan construct a transformed outcome (TO) for each user as an alternative measure of individual treatment effect. LetY obs\\ni be the\\nobserved outcome for the i-th unit. Additionally, let p be the assignment probability, which, in practice, is the traffic percentage\\nassigned to the treatment group in an A/B test. The transformed outcome for the i-th unit, Y ∗\\ni , is then defined as:\\nY ∗\\ni = Y obs\\ni × (Ti−p)\\np(1−p) .\\nA beneficial property of the TO is that, under the unconfoundedness assumption, the conditional expectation E[Y ∗\\ni |Xi = x] equals\\nthe conditional average treatment effect τ(x).\\nWe propose the following method, which combines the BH method and Transformed Outcome, to detect heterogeneous subgroups.\\nSuppose we have n users from p subgroups, and we want to identify subgroups with heterogeneous treatment effects that differ from\\nthe average treatment effect with a controlled FDR. We propose the following procedure, which we call the HTE-BH method:\\n• Step 1: Create an n × p design matrix X such that Xi,j = 1 if the i-th user belongs to the j-th subgroup.\\n• Step 2: Compute the transformed outcomes Y ∗ for all users based on the formula in Equation (5), and then subtract the\\nestimated ATE, ¯Y (1) − ¯Y (0), from all transformed outcomes. Let Y be the vector of the resulting outcomes.\\n• Step 3: Perform a linear regression using Y as the response and X as the design matrix, and obtain the p-values for the\\ncoefficient estimates corresponding to all subgroups.\\n• Step 4: Apply the BH procedure to the p-values to finalize the list of selected heterogeneous subgroups.\\nThe design matrix X created in Step 1 is orthogonal in this scenario, so the p-values derived from the linear regression are independent.\\nConsequently, the BH procedure can control the FDR at a pre-specified level q. In Step 2, we subtract the estimated ATE from the\\ntransformed outcomes to detect subgroups with treatment effects different from the ATE. For simplicity, we treat the estimated\\nATE as a parameter. Although this overlooks the fact that the estimated ATE is a random variable, it has practical relevance as\\npractitioners are typically interested in observing which subgroups are statistically different from the observed average treatment\\neffect across all users in an experiment. Note that obtaining p-values in the manner described in Step 3 is equivalent to obtaining\\np-values from running independent t-tests for all subgroups.\\n2.5 Detection for Heterogeneous Factors\\nIn addition to detecting heterogeneous subgroups, identifying the factors that contribute to the heterogeneity of treatment effects is\\nanother crucial task in practice. At Snap, we have anonymously constructed hundreds of user properties, including demographic\\ninformation such as age and gender, as well as user engagement levels, such as how users interact with snaps, stories, or discover.\\n3Often, when presented with subtle experimental results, we are unsure which of these factors to investigate further. By pinpointing\\nthe factors contributing to the heterogeneity in treatment effects, we can more effectively delve into the relevant factors and derive\\ninsights. The HTE-BH method is straightforward and easy to implement for detecting heterogeneous subgroups but is not suitable\\nfor detecting heterogeneous factors because, in this case, we cannot construct an orthogonal design matrix in Step 1 of the HTE-BH\\nmethod. Therefore, we propose using the ’Knockoff’ method to control the FDR for heterogeneous factors.\\nThe ’Knockoff’ is a recently proposed FDR control method. Suppose the response of interest, y, follows the classical linear model:\\ny = Xβ + ϵ, where y ∈ Rn is a vector of y, X ∈ Rn×p is any fixed design matrix, β is a vector of unknown coefficients, and\\nϵ ∼ N(0, σ2I) is Gaussian error. Note that n is the number of observations and p is the number of variables. For the Knockoff\\nmethod, we assume that n ≥ 2p, which is reasonable in practice because we are likely to have more observations than variables in\\nmost A/B tests.\\nLet Σ = XT X after normalizing X. The ’Knockoff’ procedure can be summarized in three steps:\\n• Step 1: Construct a ’knockoff’ matrix ˜X of X such that ˜X satisfies: ˜XT ˜X = XT X = Σ, XT ˜X = Σ − diags, where s is\\na non-negative vector that we will construct.\\n• Step 2: Compute a statistic Wj for each pair (Xj, ˜Xj) such that a large positive value of Wj provides evidence against the\\nnull hypothesis that the j-th variable is not included in the true model.\\n• Step 3: Calculate a data-dependent threshold T such that the FDR of the knockoff selection set ˆS := {j : Wj ≥ T} is less\\nthan or equal to the pre-specified level q.\\nIn our proposal, we use the equi-correlated method to obtain the non-negative vector s used in Step 1 to construct the knockoff\\nmatrix ˜X. The equi-correlated method suggests using sj = min{2λmin(Σ), 1} for all j, where λmin is the smallest eigenvalue of\\nΣ. After obtaining this s, we construct ˜X using the formula: ˜X = X(I − Σ−1diags) + ˜UC , where ˜U is an n × p orthonormal\\nmatrix satisfying ˜UT X = 0, and C is a Cholesky decomposition satisfying CT C = 2diags − diagsΣ−1diags.\\nThere are numerous options available for computing the statistics Wj’s in Step 2. We choose to use Lasso to compute the statistics\\nWj’s. Let X∗ = [X ˜X] ∈ Rn×2p be the augmented design matrix. Recall the Lasso problem: minimizeβ||y − X∗β||2\\n2 + λ||β||1.\\nDefine Zj = sup{λ : βj(λ) ̸= 0 }, which is the largest tuning parameter λ that first allows the j-th variable to enter the\\nmodel. Note that (Zj, Zj+p) is a pair corresponding to the j-th original variable and its knockoff. We then calculate Wj as:\\nWj = (Zj − Zj+p) × sign(Zj − Zj+p), for j = 1, ..., p.\\nLet W be the set {|W1|, ...,|Wp|} \\\\ {0}. In Step 3, it is proposed to use the threshold: T = min{t ∈ W : 1+#{j:Wj ≤−t}\\n#{j:Wj ≥t} ≤ q}.\\nTheorem 2 claims that the knockoff selection set ˆS := {j : Wj ≥ T} is theoretically guaranteed to have an FDR less than q.\\nWe propose the following procedure to detect the variables that contribute to the heterogeneity in treatment effects while controlling\\nthe FDR. We call this the HTE-Knockoff method:\\n• Step 1: Construct a design matrix X based on the set of pre-treatment variables.\\n• Step 2: Calculate the transformed outcomes Y ∗ for all users based on the formula in Equation (5), and then subtract the\\nestimated ATE, ¯Y (1) − ¯Y (0), from all transformed outcomes. Let Y be the vector of the resulting outcomes.\\n• Step 3: Create a knockoff matrix ˜X of X.\\n• Step 4: Run a Lasso regression using Y as the response and X∗ = [X ˜X] as the design matrix.\\n• Step 5: Follow the procedure of the Knockoff method to obtain the knockoff selection set of heterogeneous variables.\\nNote that our proposed HTE-Knockoff method can also detect heterogeneous subgroups because it works for any full-rank design\\nmatrix, regardless of orthogonality. Additionally, the HTE-Knockoff method is applicable whenXi is a set of variables including\\nboth categorical and continuous variables, but we need to be careful in constructing the design matrix when there are more than one\\ncategorical variables in Xi.\\n3 Results\\nWe apply the HTE-BH and HTE-Knockoff methods to two real experimental datasets. In the first experiment, both methods yield\\nnearly identical selections for heterogeneous subgroups. If we were to use the naive approach, it would select many more subgroups,\\nclearly indicating numerous false positives. The HTE results reveal drastically different effects in English-speaking countries versus\\nnon-English-speaking countries. Retrospectively, we understood that the new layout in the experiment favored non-English content\\nwhile suppressing high-quality content in English.\\nIn the second experiment, the HTE-BH method selects one subgroup as heterogeneous, whereas the HTE-Knockoff method selects\\nnone. This likely represents a scenario where the true treatment effects are too small to be detected, causing the HTE-Knockoff\\n4method to be more conservative than the HTE-BH method to avoid making any false positives. This observation aligns with the\\nsimulation results.\\n4 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we propose the HTE-BH method for detecting heterogeneous subgroups with treatment effects different from the\\naverage, and the HTE-Knockoff method for identifying factors contributing to the heterogeneity in treatment effects. While the\\nHTE-BH method is easier to implement, the HTE-Knockoff method has a broader application as it can also be used to detect\\nheterogeneous factors. Our proposed methods demonstrate good detection power while addressing the multiple testing problem by\\ncontrolling the FDR level.\\nDespite their wide application scenarios, our current methods have some limitations and could be improved in future research. The\\nfirst limitation is the assumption that the true model is a linear regression model with Gaussian error; the theoretical properties\\nof the original Knockoff method are based on this assumption. Although we show that the Knockoff method can still perform\\nwell in controlling FDR in some non-Gaussian error cases, there is no theoretical proof for such robustness. Additionally, the\\ntrue relationship between the treatment effect and the variables may not always be linear, making the use of linear regression\\ninappropriate. Recently, a model-free knockoff method has been proposed, which, under certain conditions, can work on any kind of\\nnon-linear model. This idea could be useful if we aim to extend the HTE-Knockoff procedure to a more generalized setting in future\\nwork.\\nAnother unresolved issue is scalability. We attempted to use the transformed design matrix to conduct HTE detection on multiple\\nexperiments, but this resulted in increased computational complexity. This problem warrants further investigation because most\\ncompanies have a large number of A/B test results available, and it is not feasible to apply the HTE detection method to each\\nexperiment individually.\\n5'},\n",

One promising application of LLMs\\nis in aiding the scientific peer-review process. However, the idea of using LLMs in peer review\\nis contentious and fraught with potential issues. LLMs can hallucinate, exhibit biases, and may\\ncompromise the fairness of the peer-review process. Despite these potential issues, LLMs may serve\\nas useful analytical tools to scrutinize manuscripts and identify possible weaknesses or inaccuracies\\nthat need addressing.\\nIn this study, we take the first steps towards harnessing the power of LLMs in the application of\\nconference peer review. We conduct an experiment at a premier conference in the field of machine\\nlearning. While the wider ethical implications and appropriate use cases of LLMs remain unclear and\\nmust be a larger community discussion, here, we evaluate a relatively clear-cut and low-risk use case:\\nvetting paper submissions against submission standards, with results shown only to the authors.\\nSpecifically, the peer-review process requires authors to submit a checklist appended to their\\nmanuscripts. Such author checklists, utilized in as well as in other peer-review venues, contain\\na set of questions designed to ensure that authors follow appropriate research and manuscript prepa-\\nration practices. The Paper Checklist is a series of yes/no questions that help authors check if their\\nwork meets reproducibility, transparency, and ethical research standards expected for papers. The\\nchecklist is a critical component in maintaining standards of research presented at the conference.\\nAdhering to the guidelines outlined by these checklists helps authors avoid mistakes that could lead\\nto rejection during peer review.\\nWe deploy and evaluate a Checklist Assistant powered by LLMs. This assistant scrutinizes au-\\nthors2019 responses to the checklist, proposing enhancements for submissions to meet the confer-\\nence2019s requirements.

We then\\nsystematically evaluate the benefits and risks of LLMs by conducting a structured study to understand\\nif LLMs can enhance research quality and improve efficiency by helping authors understand if their\\nwork meets research standards. Specifically, we administered surveys both before and after use of\\nthe Checklist Assistant asking authors about their expectations for and perceptions of the tool. We\\n.received 539 responses to the pre-usage survey, 234 submissions the the Checklist Assistant and 78\\nresponses to the post-usage survey. Our main findings are as follows:\\n(1) Authors generally reported that the LLM-assisted checklist review was a valuable enhancement to\\nthe paper submission process.\\n• The majority of surveyed authors reported a positive experience using the LLM assistant.\\nAfter using the assistant, over 70\\n• Authors 2019 expectations of the assistant 2019s effectiveness were even more positive\\nbefore using it than their assessments after actually using it (Section 4.1.3).\\n• Among the main issues reported by authors in qualitative feedback, the most frequently cited\\nwere inaccuracy (20/52 respondents) and that the LLM was too strict in its requirements\\n(14/52 respon- dents) (Section 4.1.4).\\n(2) While changes in paper submissions cannot be causally attributed to use of the checklist verifi-\\ncation assistant, we find qualitative evidence that the checklist review meaningfully helped some\\nauthors to improve their submissions.\\n• Analysis of the content of LLM feedback to authors indicates that the LLM provided\\ngranular feedback to authors, generally giving 4-6 distinct and specific points of feedback\\nper question across the 15 questions (Section 4.2.1).\\n• Survey responses reflect that some authors made meaningful changes to their submissions\\n201435 survey respondents described specific modifications they would make to their\\nsubmissions in response to the Checklist Assistant (Section 4.2.2).\\n• In 40 instances, authors submitted their paper twice to the checklist verifier (accounting for\\n80 total paper submissions.) Between these two submissions, authors tended to increase the\\nlength of their checklist justifications significantly, suggesting that they may have added\\ncontent in response to LLM feedback (Section 4.2.3).\\nFinally, we investigate how LLM-based tools can be easily manipulated 2013 specifically, we find\\nthat with AI- assisted re-writing of the justifications, an adversarial author can make the Checklist\\nAssistant significantly more lenient (Section 5.1).\\nIn summary, the majority of authors found LLM assistance to be beneficial, highlighting the significant\\npotential of LLMs to enhance scientific workflows 2014 whether by serving as direct assistants to\\nauthors or helping journals and conferences verify guideline compliance. However, our findings also\\nunderscore that LLMs cannot fully replace human expertise in these contexts. A notable portion of\\nusers encountered inaccuracies, and the models were also vulnerable to adversarial manipulation.\\nOur code, LLM prompts, and sample papers used for testing are available at:\\nhttps://github.com/ihsaan-ullah/neurips-checklist-assistant\\n2 Related Work\\nIn the following section, we provide background on the Author Checklist (Section 2.1) and on the\\nuse of LLMs in the scientific peer review process (Section 2.2).\\n2.1 The Author Checklist\\nWe provide below the checklist questions used in submission template. We provide only the questions\\nhere and give the full version including guidelines in Appendix A. These questions are designed\\nby organizers, not specifically for this study, and questions are carried over from previous years.\\nThe authors had to provide a response to each question, comprising 201cYes,201d 2018No201d or\\n201cNA201d (Not Applicable), along with a justification for their answer.\\nClaims: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper2019s\\ncontri- butions and scope?\\nLimitations: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?\\n2Theory Assumptions and Proofs: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of\\nassumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?\\nExperimental Result Reproducibility: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to\\nreproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims\\nand/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?\\nOpen access to data and code: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient\\ninstructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental\\nmaterial?\\nExperimental Setting/Details: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits,\\nhyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?\\nExperiment Statistical Significance: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or\\nother appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?\\nExperiments Compute Resources: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information\\non the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce\\nthe experiments?\\nCode Of Ethics: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the Code\\nof Ethics\\nBroader Impacts: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal\\nimpacts of the work performed?\\nSafeguards: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of\\ndata or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators,\\nor scraped datasets)?\\nLicenses for existing assets: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models),\\nused in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and\\nproperly respected?\\nNew Assets: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation\\nprovided alongside the assets?\\nCrowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects: For crowdsourcing experiments and research\\nwith human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and\\nscreen- shots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?\\nInstitutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Sub- jects:\\nDoes the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were\\ndisclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent\\napproval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?\\n2.2 Related work\\nLanguage models have been used in the scientific peer review process for over a decade. The primary\\napplication so far has been in assigning reviewers to papers. Here, a language model first computes\\na 201csimilarity score 201d between every reviewer-paper pair, based on the text of the submitted\\npaper and the text of the reviewer2019s previously published papers. A higher value of the similarity\\nscore indicates that the language model considers this reviewer to have a higher expertise for this\\npaper. Given these similarity scores, reviewers are then assigned to papers using an optimization\\nroutine that maximizes the similarity scores of the assigned reviewer-paper pairs.\\nThere have been recent works that design or use LLMs to write the entire review of papers. The\\noutcome measures for evaluating the effectiveness of the LLM- generated reviews are based on\\nratings sourced from authors or other researchers. It is not entirely clear how these ratings translate to\\nmeeting the objectives of peer review in practice namely that of identifying errors, choosing better\\npapers, and providing useful feedback to authors. Moreover, it is also known that evaluation of\\npeer reviews themselves are fraught with biases, and the aggregate effect of such biases on these\\nevaluations of reviews is not clear. Our work focuses on a more concrete task in reviewing papers\\nthan generating an end-to-end review, namely validating that papers meet criteria specified in an\\n3Author Checklist. Moreover, we evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in the setting of an actual peer review\\nconference.\\nRecent work also investigates whether LLMs can identify errors in papers and shows promising\\ninitial results. The paper constructs a set of short papers with deliberately inserted errors and asks\\nLLMs to identify errors. GPT-4 does identify the error more than half the time. Another experiment\\ndescribed asks GPT-4 to identify deliberately inserted errors in three full papers. It successfully and\\nconsis- tently does so on one paper, partially and occasionally on a second paper, and is consistently\\nunsuccessful on the third. Note that in both experiments, the prompts specifically asked the LLM to\\nfind errors rather than generically asking the LLM to review the paper. Moreover, both experiments\\nhad small sample sizes in terms of the number of papers. In another set of experiments presented,\\nevaluated the ability of large language models (LLMs) to compare the 201cstrength201d of results\\nbetween papers, mirroring the goals of conferences and journals in selecting 2018better 2019 papers.\\nThe experiment consisted of creating 10 pairs of abstracts, where one abstract in each pair was\\nmade 2018 clearly 2019 and objectively stronger than the other. To simulate diverse, yet irrelevant\\nconditions, the language of the abstracts was deliberately varied. In this test, GPT-4 performed no\\nbetter than random chance in identifying the stronger abstract, underscoring that while LLMs may\\nexcel at some complex tasks like scientific error identification, they often struggle with seemingly\\nsimpler tasks.\\nThe papers investigate the performance of LLMs in evaluating checklist compliance. These studies,\\nhowever, were retrospective studies of published papers, whereas our work is deployed live associated\\nto a peer-review venue and helps authors improve their checklist compliance before they make their\\nsubmission.\\nRecent work has highlighted the prevalence of the use of LLMs both in preparation of scientific paper\\nmanuscripts and in the generation of scientific peer reviews. For example, estimates that as of January\\n2024, 17.5\\n3 Methodology\\nWe design an LLM-based tool (Checklist Assistant) to assist authors in ensuring their submitted\\nchecklists are thoroughly answered. Our platform interfaced with a third-party LLM (GPT-4 from\\nOpenAI), using simple prompt engineering with these hyper-parameters: temperature = 1, topp = 1,\\nand n = 1. For each checklist question, the LLM is provided with the author2019s checklist response\\nand justification, alongside the complete paper and any appendices. The LLM2019s role is to assess\\nthe accuracy and thoroughness of each response and justification, offering targeted suggestions for\\nimprovement. Each checklist item is treated as an individual task, i.e., an API call with only one\\nquestion, its answer and justification by the author, and the paper and appendices. The API call\\nreturns a review and score for the submitted question.\\nFigure 1 illustrates examples of feedback provided by the Checklist Assistant for two different papers.\\nIn these examples, green indicates that the tool found 201cno significant concerns201d, while orange\\nsignals 201cneeds improvement201d with the Paper Checklist standards. Authors are encouraged to\\ncarefully review any orange feedback, validate the identified issues, and make the necessary revisions\\nto align with the checklist requirements.\\n3.1 Deployment\\nWe deployed the Checklist Assistant on Codabench.org. We configured 15 Google Cloud CPU\\nworkers, integrated with Codabench, to handle multiple paper submissions concurrently. The bulk of\\nthe computations were carried out by the LLM third-party software (GPT-4 from OpenAI) via API\\ncalls (one call per question, and additional calls in case of failure).\\nParticipation was fully voluntary, and participants were recruited through a blog post that was released\\n8 days before the abstract submission deadline. Interested participants were asked to register though\\na Google form. Participants who submitted registration requests through the Google form were then\\ngiven access to the Assistant on the Codabench platform. The submissions were entirely optional and\\ncompletely separate from the paper submission system and the review process. The papers had to be\\nformatted as specified in the call for papers (complete with appendices and checklist). Information\\nprovided in external links was not taken into account by the assistant. We asked submitters to fill out\\n4the checklist to the best of their abilities. Submissions made via the Codabench landing page were\\nprocessed as follows:\\nChecklist Assistant: The paper was parsed using a PDF-to-text parser, then screened for any problems\\nsuch as the format of the paper or checklist, etc. Each answered question in the checklist was\\nprocessed by an LLM using an API.\\nResult Compilation: LLM responses were combined for all questions and formatted in an HTML\\ndocument with proper colors and structure for readability and user-friendliness.\\nWe encountered several parsing issues with both paper texts and checklists. Initially, our parser\\nstruggled with subsections and titles, prompting code improvements to handle sections accurately.\\nChecklist parsing also faced issues due to spacing and incomplete checklists, which we addressed by\\nrefining the code. Special characters, especially merged letters like 201cfi 201d and 201cfl 201d in\\nthe submitted PDFs required further parsing updates.\\n3.2 Prompt engineering\\nIn this section we discuss design of a prompt given to the LLM, tasked to behave as Checklist\\nAssistant. We provide the full prompt in Appendix B.\\nWhile preparing the Checklist Assistant, we experimented with various prompt styles. Tuning was\\ncarried out using a dozen papers. Some checklists were filled out with our best effort to be correct,\\nand others included deliberately planted errors to verify robustness and calibrate the scores. We\\nobserved that the LLM performed better with clear, step-by-step instructions.\\nOur final prompt provided a sequence of instructions covering different aspects of the required\\nreview, designed as follows: first, the context is set by indicating that the paper is under review for\\nthe conference. Next, the main goal is clarified, specifying that the LLM2019s primary task is to\\nassist the author in responding to the checklist question. The LLM is then directed to review the\\nauthor2019s answer and justification, identifying any discrepancies with the paper based on the\\nspecific guidelines of the question. It is instructed to provide itemized, actionable feedback according\\nto the guidelines, offering suggestions for improvement, with clear examples for responses such as\\n201cYes, 201d 201cNo, 201d or 201cNA. 201d At the end of the review, the LLM is asked to assign\\na score: Score=1 for no issues, Score=0.5 for minor improvements, and Score=0 for critical issues.\\nFinally, the LLM is provided with the checklist question, the author 2019s answer, justification, the\\nrelevant guidelines, and the paper content.\\nBefore prompt adjustments, LLM responses often mixed the review with the score. To fix this, we\\nspecified that the score should be returned on a separate line at the end of the review. For long papers\\nexceeding 35 pages (or 15,000 words), we processed only the first 15,000 words and notified authors\\nwith a warning.\\nWe hypothesized that users might find the LLM responses overly strict, vague, and lengthy (which\\nwas indeed later confirmed), so we added prompt instructions like 201cuse 0 score sparingly 201d,\\n201cprovide itemized, actionable feedback 201d, and 201cfocus on significant improvements. 201d\\nAlthough the Checklist Assistant returned scores of 0, 0.5, and 1, we combined the 0 and 0.5 scores\\nto indicate that improvement was needed, rather than differentiating between two levels of severity\\n(with red for 0 and orange for 0.5). This decision was made due to concerns that the LLM 2019s\\nevaluations might be too harsh. User feedback on LLM strictness and other issues is analyzed in\\nSection 4.\\nWe also tested whether the LLM was consistent in generating answers for reiterations of the same\\ninput. As a sanity check, we test for each question, whether the variation of the output scores for\\nmultiple runs on the same paper is comparable to the variation across papers. We find that the\\nvariation in scores for multiple runs on the same paper is significantly lower than variation across\\npapers (p < 0.05; based on a one sided permutation test after BH correction) for all but one question.\\nThe only question that had a comparable variance within and across papers was the question on ethics\\n(Q9; p > 0.4).\\n53.3 Anonymity, confidentiality, and consent\\nThe authors could retain their anonymity by registering to Codabench with an email that did not\\nreveal their identity, and by submitting anonymized papers. The papers and LLM outputs were\\nkept confidential and were not be accessible to reviewers, meta reviewers, and program chairs. It is\\nimportant to note that while authors retained ownership of their submissions, the papers were sent to\\nthe API of an LLM service, and treated under their conditions of confidentiality.\\nThis study was approved by the Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Review Board (IRB). The\\nparticipants gave written documentation of informed consent to participate.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn our evaluations, we seek to address two main questions regarding the use of an LLM-automated\\nAuthor Checklist Assistant:\\n(1) Do authors perceive an LLM Author Checklist Assistant as a valuable enhancement to the paper\\nsub- mission process?\\n(2) Does the use of an Author Checklist Assistant meaningfully help authors to improve their paper\\nsub- missions?\\nIn order to understand author experience using the provided Author Checklist Assistant, we surveyed\\nauthors before and after submitting to the Author Checklist Assistant. Additionally, we analyzed the\\ncontent and submission patterns of author 2019s checklists and the LLM responses. A summary of our\\nmain findings is given in Section 1. In this subsequent section we provide detailed analyses of survey\\nresponses and usage of the Checklist Assistant. In Section 4.1, we give results on author perception\\nand experience and in Section 4.2 we analyze changes made by authors to their submissions after\\nusing the Author Checklist Assistant.\\n4.1 Author Perception and Experience\\nFirst, we analyze the authors 2019 usage patterns and perceptions of the Author Checklist Assistant,\\nas captured through surveys. In Section 4.1.1, we provide an overview of how authors filled out the\\nchecklist and the responses given by the LLM on their checklists. In Section 4.1.2, we detail the\\nsurvey methodology used to understand author experience and in Section 4.1.3, we analyze results of\\nthe survey. Finally, in Section 4.1.4, we overview the main challenges identified by authors when\\nusing the Author Checklist Assistant.\\n4.1.1 Overview of Checklist Usage and Responses\\nA total of 234 papers, each accompanied by a checklist, were submitted to the assistant. For each\\nchecklist question, authors could respond with Yes, No, NA, or TODO. As illustrated in Figure\\n2a, most questions received a Yes response, indicating that the authors confirmed their paper met\\nthe corresponding checklist criteria. However, for the questions on Theory, Impacts, Safeguards,\\nDocumentation, Human Subjects, and Risks, a significant portion of authors selected NA. Additionally,\\na notable number of authors responded No to the questions on Code and Data, and Error Bars.\\nIn response to the authors 2019 checklists, the LLM provided written feedback, with green indicating\\n2018No Concerns 2019 and orange indicating 2018Needs improvement 2019. Figure 2b illustrates\\nthe distribution of LLM feedback for each checklist question. For most questions, the majority of\\nfeedback suggested that the checklist or manuscript could be improved. However, for the questions\\non Theory, Human Subjects, and Risks, many NA responses were deemed appropriate, leading the\\nLLM to respond with 2019No Concerns. 2019 This likely reflects the LLM 2019s confidence in\\nconfirming that certain papers did not include theory, human subjects research, or clear broader risks,\\nmaking those checklist items irrelevant. In Figure 3, we show the distribution of LLM evaluations\\nper submission. All submissions received several 2018Needs improvement 2019 ratings, with each\\nbeing advised to improve on 8 to 13 out of the 15 checklist questions.\\n64.1.2 Survey Methodology\\nTo assess authors 2019 perceptions of the usefulness of the Author Checklist Assistant, we conducted\\na survey with all participants both at registration (pre-usage) and immediately after using the Author\\nChecklist Assistant (post-usage). We provide the content of the surveys in Figure 4. Both surveys\\ncontained the same four questions, with the pre-usage survey focusing on expectations and the post-\\nusage survey on actual experience. Responses were recorded on a four-point Likert scale, ranging\\nfrom strongly disagree to strongly agree. In the post-usage survey, we also asked authors to provide\\nfreeform feedback on (1) any changes they planned to make to their paper, and (2) any issues they\\nencountered while using the Checklist Assistant.\\nWe received 539 responses to the pre-usage survey and 234 papers submitted. However, we received\\nonly 78 responses to the post-usage survey, representing 63 unique participants (due to multiple\\nsubmissions for the same paper). While completing the pre-registration survey was mandatory for all\\nparticipants, the post-usage survey was optional. As a result, all participants in the post-usage survey\\nhad also completed the pre-registration survey.\\n4.1.3 Survey Responses\\nFigure 5 presents the survey responses collected before and after using the checklist verification tool.\\nWe include responses from authors who completed both surveys (n=63). In cases where authors\\nsubmitted the survey multiple times for the same paper, we included only the earliest post-usage\\nresponse. Including the duplicated responses made a negligible difference, with the proportion of\\npositive responses changing by less than 0.02 across all questions.\\nOverall, the majority of authors responded positively regarding their experience with the Checklist\\nAssis- tant. 70\\nIt is notable that authors were even more positive before using the tool. Comparing pre- and post-\\nusage responses, there was a statistically significant drop in positive feedback on the 201cUseful 201d\\nand 201cExcited to Use 201d questions 2014we run a permutation test with 50,0000 permutations to\\ntest whether the difference between proportion of positive responses pre and post-usage is non-zero,\\nwhich gives Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values of 0.007 and 0.013 for 201cExcited to Use 201d\\nand 201cUseful 201d respectively with effect sizes of 22120.23 and 22120.2.\\nWe also assessed the correlation between post-usage survey responses and the number of 2018needs\\nimprove- ment 2019 scores given by the LLM to authors. In Figure 6, we show mean number of\\nneeds improvement scores for authors responding positively or negatively to each survey question.\\nWe find no substantial ef- fect of number of 2018needs improvement 2019 scores on survey responses.\\nThis may reflect that the number of 2018needs improvement 2019 scores was less important in author\\n2019s perception than the written content of the LLM 2019s evaluation.\\nFinally, we examined potential selection bias due to the drop-off in participation in the post-usage\\nsurvey by analyzing the pre-usage survey responses across different groups. As noted earlier, only\\na portion of the 539 participants who completed the pre-usage survey went on to submit papers\\n(234 Submitters), and an even smaller group responded to the post-usage survey (78 Post-Usage\\nRespondents). In Figure 7, we compare the pre-usage survey responses between Submitters and\\nNon-Submitters, as well as between Post- Usage Respondents and Non-Respondents. No substantial\\ndifferences in rates of positive responses were found (using a permutation test for the difference in\\nmean response, gave p-values of > 0.3 for all questions before multiple testing correction), suggesting\\nthere is no significant selection bias.\\n4.1.4 Challenges in Usage\\nIn addition to the structured survey responses, 52 out of the 78 post-usage survey submissions\\nincluded freeform feedback detailing issues with the Checklist Assistant 2019s usage. We manually\\ncategorized the reported issues from these responses and identified the following primary concerns,\\nlisted in order of decreasing frequency (summarized in Figure 8):\\nInaccurate: 20 authors reported that the LLM was inaccurate. Note that it is not possible to tell from\\nthe responses how many inaccuracies participants found in individual questions since the survey did\\nnot ask about individual checklist questions. Many participants noted specific issues, in particular\\nthat the LLM overlooked content in the paper, requesting changes to either the checklist or the paper\\n7for elements that the authors believed were already addressed. Additionally, some authors reported\\nmore nuanced accuracy issues. For instance, one author mentioned that the LLM misinterpreted a\\n201cthought experiment 201d as a real experiment and incorrectly asked for more details about the\\nexperimental setup. Another author reported that the LLM mistakenly assumed human subjects were\\ninvolved due to a discussion of 201cinterpretability 201d in the paper.\\nToo strict: 14 authors reported that the LLM was too strict.\\nInfeasible to make changes due to page limits: 5 authors felt that they received useful feedback, but it\\nwould not be possible to incorporate due to their papers already being at the page limit.\\nToo generic: 4 authors reported that the feedback they received was not specific enough to their paper.\\nInsufficient LLM capabilities: 4 authors complained that the LLM could not handle content over the\\n(LLM assistant 2019s) page limit or that it was not multimodal and hence ignored figures.\\nFeedback inconsistent across submissions: 3 authors reported that the LLM feedback changed across\\nmultiple submissions to the server even though the paper and checklist content did not change.\\nDesire for full paper review: 3 authors reported that they would like feedback on the entire paper, not\\njust on checklist items.\\nBad at theory (mathematical) papers: 2 authors wrote that the LLM seemed bad at theory (mathemati-\\ncal) papers.\\nToo verbose: 2 authors wrote that the LLM 2019s feedback was too wordy.\\n4.2 Changes to Submissions in Response to Feedback\\nIn the following analysis, we integrate an assessment of the LLM 2019s feedback with the authors\\n2019 checklist answers, to better understand whether the Checklist Assistant helped authors make\\nconcrete and meaningful changes to their papers. In Section 4.2.1, we analyze the types of feedback\\ngiven by the LLM to authors. In Section 4.2.2, we overview the changes to their papers that authors\\nself-reported making in survey responses. Lastly, in Section 4.2.3, we analyze changes made in\\nmultiple submissions of the same paper to the Author Checklist Assistant.\\n4.2.1 Characterization of LLM Feedback by Question\\nFor authors to make meaningful changes to their papers, the Author Checklist Assistant must provide\\nconcrete feedback. In this section, we analyze the type of feedback given by the Checklist Assistant\\nto determine whether it is specific to the checklist answers or more generic.\\nGiven the large volume of feedback, we employed an LLM to extract key points from the Checklist\\nAssistant 2019s responses for each question on the paper checklist and to cluster these points into\\noverarching categories. Specifically, for each of the 15 questions across the 234 checklist submissions,\\nwe used GPT-4 to identify the main points of feedback provided to authors. We manually inspected\\nthat the main points extracted by GPT-4 matched the long-form feedback on 10 randomly selected\\nsubmitted paper checklists and found that GPT-4 was highly accurate in extracting these key feedback\\npoints. We then passed the names and descriptions of these feedback points to GPT-4 to hierarchically\\ncluster them into broader themes.\\nThe most frequently identified feedback themes for 4 questions are shown in Figure 9. Here are our\\nkey observations from this analysis.\\nThe LLM identified many granular types of feedback within each checklist question. We illustrate with\\nexamples of responses to four questions in Figure 9. For instance, the LLM gave granular feedback\\nwithin the Experimental settings/details question on optimizer configuration details, implementation\\ncode availability, and explicit mention of non-traditional experiments.\\nThe LLM tended to provide 4-6 distinct points of feedback per question (for each of the 15 questions).\\nThe LLM is capable of giving concrete and specific feedback for many questions. For example, on\\nthe 201cClaims 201d question, the LLM commented on consistency and precision in documenting\\nclaims on 50 papers, including feedback like matching the abstract and introduction and referencing\\nappendices. On the 201cCompute resources 201d question the LLM commented specifically on\\ndetailing compute / execution time of methods.\\n8The LLM tends to provide some generic boilerplate for each question. The most common category of\\nfeedback for each question is a generic commentary on enhancing general aspects of the question.\\nThere are certain topics that appear across many questions, in particular discussion of limitations and\\nimproved documentation.\\nThe LLM often expands the scope of checklist questions. For example, the LLM brings up repro-\\nducibility as a concern in feedback to the code of ethics question and brings up anonymity quite\\nfrequently in the code and data accessibility question.\\nWe provide a full list of the summarized main themes of feedback in Appendix C. In summary, our\\nanalysis of the feedback given by the LLM suggests that the LLM gave concrete and actionable\\nfeedback to authors that they could potentially use to modify their paper submissions. Our analysis\\nalso suggests that a more detailed checklist could be developed to provide more granular feedback,\\nbased on the rubrics covered by the Author Checklist Assistant. Such a detailed checklist could be\\nprocessed automatically by an LLM to systematically identify specific, commonly overlooked issues\\nin scientific papers and flag concrete issues for authors to resolve.\\n4.2.2 Authors2019 Descriptions of Submission Changes\\nWe obtain additional evidence of changes made by authors in response to the Checklist Assistant\\nthrough the post-usage survey. In the survey, we asked authors to detail in freeform feedback any\\nchanges they had made or planned to make in responses to feedback from the LLM. Of the 78\\nsurvey responses, 45 provided feedback to this question. Of these 45 responses, 35 actually described\\nchanges they would make (the remainder used this freeform feedback to describe issues that they had\\nin using the assistant). Based on manual coding of the comments, we identified the main themes in\\nchanges they planned to make:\\n14 authors said that they would improve justifications for their checklist answers by including more\\ndetail and/or references to paper sections.\\n6 authors said that they would add more details about experiments, datasets, or compute.\\n2 authors said they would change an answer to the checklist that they filled out incorrectly.\\n2 or fewer authors mentioned improving the intro/abstract, discussion of limitations, and discussion\\nof standard errors.\\nOverall, these responses indicate that some authors were motivated to modify their submissions due\\nto feedback from the checklist verification.\\n4.2.3 Analysis of Re-submissions\\nFinally, we analyze changes made between submissions to the Checklist Assistant when authors\\nsubmitted multiple times. There were 40 instances where an author submitted the same paper to\\nthe checklist verification multiple times (out of 184 total distinct paper submissions to the checklist\\nverification). In this analysis, we assess changes made to the paper checklist between the first and\\nsecond submission to our checklist verifier in order to understand whether authors made substantive\\nchanges to their checklists and/or paper manuscripts in response to feedback from the checklist\\nverification.\\n9'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Examining the Initial Experiences of Researchers\\nWhen Articulating Broader Impact\\nAbstract\\nBy mandating a broader impact statement with every submission for this year’s\\nconference, the program chairs at the conference highlighted ethics as a crucial\\ncomponent of AI research. Building on precedents from other fields and a grow-\\ning awareness within the community, this paper seeks to explore how individual\\nresearchers responded to this new requirement. This exploration includes their\\nopinions, their experiences during the drafting process, and their reflections after\\ntheir papers were accepted. We present survey results and key considerations to\\ninform the next iteration of the broader impact requirement, should it continue to\\nbe mandated for future conferences.\\n1 Introduction\\nThere is a growing number of unethical uses of technology. To counter this trend, some proposals\\nsuggest limiting investment or procurement without impact assessment, or even calling for outright\\nbans. Other proposals aim to instill ethical practices earlier in the research stage, before technology\\ntransfers into products. Conferences that are typically technical have begun to host workshops on\\nsocial impact issues and, in some instances, have announced more interdisciplinary subject areas.\\nThe most significant change may be the requirement for a statement of broader impact for all\\nsubmissions. Unlike workshops and interdisciplinary tracks, which might be viewed as more specific,\\nthis requirement affects every submission, of which there are over 9000 this year. While broader\\nimpact statements themselves are not new to the wider research community, they are new to this\\nspecific community. This paper seeks to explore how individual researchers responded to the new\\nrequirement, including their perspectives, their experiences and process in drafting the statements,\\nand their subsequent thoughts after paper acceptances.\\nThis research was initiated through internal discussion at our organization, which then became part\\nof a broader public conversation. To collect perspectives from researchers, both within and beyond\\nour organization, we developed an online public survey. The findings from this survey help to\\ninform considerations for designing the next iteration of the broader impact requirement, should\\nit remain a requirement for future conferences. While it is recognized that researchers are not the\\nonly intended audience for these statements, and that others also have responsibilities in ethical\\nresearch and technology development, researchers represent a critical mass to mobilize in this effort.\\nUnderstanding the researchers’ experience and process is essential not only to the design of the\\nrequirement, but also to advancing ethical research practices in general.\\n2 Survey Method\\nThe study employed an exploratory mixed-methods survey with both open and closed-ended questions.\\nThe survey was split into two sections, one for researchers who submitted to the conference, and\\nanother for those who did not. The survey was anonymous, and no demographic information was\\ncollected. The survey was distributed online via research community channels and on social media.\\nThe goals were to understand how researchers considered the implications of their research, how\\n.they defined their impact statements, and to understand their opinions on this new submission\\nrequirement. Survey questions focused on their approach to writing the statement, encountered\\nchallenges, the perceived influence of the statement on the overall submission, and their views on the\\nnew requirement.\\n3 Survey Results\\nA total of 50 participants responded to the survey, with the majority identifying as academics (72\\npercent) and industry researchers (23.5 percent). There was a balanced breakdown by career stage,\\nwith graduate students making up the largest group of respondents (33 percent). Among the group\\nthat submitted, the majority identified their subject areas as deep learning and theory. However,\\namong researchers who did not submit, deep learning and social aspects of machine learning were the\\nprimary subject areas. The survey population was not compared to the overall population, though this\\ncould be an area for future study. Our questions focused on the process and challenges in completing\\nthe submission requirement, the perceived impact of the requirement on paper acceptances, and\\nresearchers’ views on the requirement.\\n3.1 Process and Challenges\\nWhen asked about their approach to the broader impact statements, 83.8 percent of respondents\\nindicated that they completed this part with their co-authors, without external help. The rest of\\nthe participants used other approaches such as accepting support or reaching out for help. A large\\nmajority spent less than 2 hours on the statement, and almost half mentioned it was not challenging to\\nprepare. There were differing trends for what could make it difficult. Some viewed their theoretical\\nwork as too distant from practical applications, making the exercise speculative. Others perceived\\nthe requirement as a \"bureaucratic constraint\". Researchers at different stages of their career found\\nthe exercise more or less challenging, but their professional domain did not appear to affect their\\nexperienced difficulty with the exercise.\\n3.2 Impact on Submission\\nAlthough it was clarified that submissions would not be rejected solely on the basis of the broader\\nimpact statement, the survey explored the researcher’s perspectives on this. For researchers who\\nsubmitted, over 75 percent believed the statements were not taken into consideration, yet almost\\n90 percent thought it was unclear how reviewers would evaluate the statements. Even with an\\nunclear evaluation process, when asked how confident they were that their statement was adequately\\naddressing the requirement, 43.2 percent stated that they were either confident or very confident.\\nTime spent did not seem to have an impact, since most of the respondents who spent less than an\\nhour also received acceptances. Those who sought external help appeared to have a lower ratio of\\nrejections, but our sample size may be too small to draw conclusive results.\\n3.3 Framing\\nThe survey explored researchers’ views on the requirement and its framing. Our results indicated\\nthat the community was divided on how to frame the requirement; 56 percent did not agree that\\nbroader impact was the right way to frame the requirement, while 44 percent did. This split was\\nsimilar when compared to subject area, submitters vs. non-submitters, and academia vs. industry.\\nPostdoctoral/early-career and mid-career respondents were more supportive of the requirement\\nframing than students and senior researchers. There seems to be a general feeling that assessing\\nbroader impact is important, but uncertainty regarding who should do it and how. Some respondents\\ndescribed the requirement as \"too broad\" or said they did not feel \"qualified to address the broader\\nimpact of their work.\" Some who supported the requirement found the thought process to be valuable\\nand that it \"forces researchers to reflect on the impact of their research\".\\n4 Integrating Feedback into Next Iteration of Broader Impact\\nThe survey results inform future iterations of the broader impact requirement. When asked what\\ncould have helped them most, 92 percent of respondents indicated that examples of statements\\n2would be most helpful. There will be an increasing number of examples to draw from in future\\nyears. Guidelines were the second most popular request, regarding when a statement might be\\napplicable or how to formulate one. This section proposes how to integrate respondent feedback\\ninto future iterations: rethinking the requirement design and framing, developing greater capacity\\nand confidence among researchers, and reflecting the shared responsibility of ethical research and\\ntechnology development.\\n4.1 Requirement Design\\nIf the goal is to develop ethical research practices, there may be other approaches to achieve this\\ngoal. While written statements make sense given the paper-based nature of submissions, survey\\nrespondents indicated a mix of nonchalance, outright farce, or perceived burden. These attitudes\\nmay have a counterproductive effect on an ethical research goal. We encourage program chairs to\\nconsider mechanisms to limit that effect (e.g., an incentive for \"best\" broader impact statements).\\nSuch mechanisms are important not only to manage negative effects but also to encourage researchers\\nwho found the exercise valuable.\\n4.2 Capacity Building\\nGiven that many respondents felt they were not qualified to address the broader impact of their\\nwork, workshops may help build capacity over time, and provide a space for researchers to examine\\ntheir work with a more diverse group of researchers. Discussions could help develop capacity and\\nconfidence, and surface overlooked impacts. Interdisciplinary collaborations could also introduce\\nnew guidelines or methodologies such as the theory of change or consequence scanning.\\n4.3 Shared Responsibility\\nRecognizing how different systems and social contexts interact would increase the quality of the\\ndiscussion on broader impact, and develop a sense of shared responsibility for ethical research and\\ntechnology development. Researchers are a critical mass, but others such as conference organizers,\\ninstitutions, funders, and users also have roles and responsibilities. To address concerns around\\nburden and expertise, the assessment of broader impact could be more of a multi-stakeholder exercise.\\n5 Conclusion\\nThis paper and its underlying survey investigated how researchers approached the broader impact\\nstatement and surfaced considerations to better design this requirement in future years. While the\\nsurvey represented a small sample of the community, its results demonstrate a division regarding\\nhow the requirement is framed. Initiating a conversation about broader impact is itself a step towards\\nestablishing norms and best practices for ethical research. We encourage further work to monitor the\\nevolution of researcher’s perspectives, not only at top conferences, but also at-large.\\n6 Acknowledgements\\nThe authors thank Noémie Lachance, Tara Tressel, and the Research Group for their support and\\nparticipation throughout this project.\\n7 Supplementary Material\\nThe survey questions and the responses received are available for further investigation and use. The\\nsurvey remains open to responses. At the time of writing, we had 50 responses which were used for\\nthe analysis in this paper.\\n3'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Multi-Agent Systems Control Using Graph Neural\\nNetworks with Model-Based Reinforcement Learning\\nAbstract\\nMulti-agent systems (MAS) play a crucial role in the advancement of machine\\nintelligence and its applications. To explore complex interactions within MAS\\nsettings, we introduce a novel \"GNN for MBRL\" model. This model employs a\\nstate-space Graph Neural Network alongside Model-based Reinforcement Learning\\nto tackle MAS tasks, such as Billiard-Avoidance and Autonomous Driving. The\\nprocess involves using a GNN model to predict the future states and paths of several\\nagents. Subsequently, a Model Predictive Control, enhanced by the Cross-Entropy\\nMethod (CEM), is used to guide the ego-agent’s action planning, facilitating\\nsuccessful completion of MAS tasks.\\n1 Introduction\\n1.1 Purpose\\nVision-based approaches have been extensively researched in various reinforcement learning (RL)\\nareas, including mastering video games directly from raw pixels, managing simulated autonomous\\nvehicles using complex image observations, and carrying out robotic tasks like grasping using state\\nrepresentations derived from complicated visual data. However, it has been shown that RL from\\ncomplex observations such as raw pixels is time-consuming and needs a lot of samples. Additionally, it\\nis widely acknowledged that learning policies from physical state-based characteristics is significantly\\nmore effective and straightforward than learning from visual pixels. Therefore, this research focused\\non learning control policies from states and exploring the use of a graph neural network (GNN)\\ndynamics model to predict future states in multi-agent systems. We then utilized a Cross-Entropy\\nMethod (CEM)-optimized model-based controller for motion planning of the ego-agent, which\\nenabled successful execution of specific MAS missions. These include multi-billiard avoidance and\\nself-driving car scenarios.\\n1.2 Background\\nInspired by a state-space model for videos that reasons about multiple objects and their positions,\\nvelocities, and interactions, our project seeks to develop a \"GNN for MBRL\" model. This model is\\nbased on a multi-billiard simulator for sample-efficient model-based control in MAS tasks involving\\nmany interacting agents. Autonomous driving, a complicated multi-agent system, requires the\\nego-agent to consider the situations of surrounding agents when conducting motion planning. The\\ngym-carla can be used for further study in this context. We begin by developing and testing our\\n\"GNN for MBRL\" model on a MAS billiard avoidance scenario to investigate the possibilities of\\nGNNs and model-based RL. We aim to transfer the framework to real-world self-driving applications.\\nGraph Neural Networks. GNNs have been proposed to create node and edge representations in\\ngraph data, achieving remarkable success in applications such as recommendation systems, social\\nnetwork prediction, and natural language processing. Recognizing the capabilities of GNNs in\\nphysical systems, we can utilize GNN-based reasoning to represent objects as nodes and relations\\nas edges, which allows for an effective approach to analyzing objects and relations. A successful\\n.example of a GNN is the state-space model, STOVE, which combines a GNN dynamics model for\\ninference with an image reconstruction model to accelerate training and improve the unsupervised\\nlearning of physical interactions. Thus, the state-space predictive model is the result of combining\\nthese two components:\\nzp(xt|zt−1) =zp(z0)zp(z1|z0) Q\\nt zp(zt|zt−1)\\nwhere x is the image observation and z represents object states. The latent positions and velocities of\\nmultiple agents act as the connection between the two components. The model uses simple uniform\\nand Gaussian distributions to initialize the states. The STOVE model is trained on video sequences\\nby maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO). STOVE has also extended their video model\\ninto reinforcement learning (RL) tasks for planning. Empirical evidence demonstrates that an actor\\nusing Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) on top of STOVE is comparable to model-free techniques,\\nsuch as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), while needing a fraction of the samples. Inspired by\\nthese RL experiments, we apply the GNN model directly to states rather than complex visual data\\nto improve sample efficiency and predict agents’ future states. This is then combined with another\\nmodel-based RL approach, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). In the experiment, we train\\nthe GNN dynamics model using ground truth states of video sequence data for multi-agent systems\\ninstead of visual data.\\nModel-based Reinforcement Learning. Model-based RL is considered a solution to the high\\nsample complexity of model-free RL. This method typically includes two primary steps: (1) creating\\na dynamics model that predicts future states based on present states and actions, and (2) using a\\nplanning method to learn a global policy and act in the environment effectively. The STOVE model\\nuses Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) to develop a policy based on the world model, which acts as a\\nplanning simulator, and found that MCTS combined with STOVE could outperform the model-free\\nPPO algorithm in a multi-billiards avoidance task.\\n2 Method\\n2.1 Framework\\nThe \"GNN for MBRL\" method consists of two primary stages: (1) a GNN dynamics model training\\nphase, using offline recorded video sequences or low-dimensional states for video prediction, and\\n(2) a motion planning phase using CEM-based Model Predictive Control (MPC). This involves a\\nfeedback control algorithm with a Cross-Entropy Method optimizer to interact with the billiard\\nenvironment. The aim is to plan effective actions for the ego-agent in order to avoid collisions.\\nThere are two different cases in the GNN dynamics training stage. The \"Action-conditioned case\"\\nfollows the STOVE model-based control approach, training GNN with an object reconstruction model\\non visual data. The \"Supervised RL case\" is designed for RL tasks directly on low-level states. Both\\ncases involve training GNN dynamics models for predicting future multi-agent states. Subsequently,\\nthe trained model is integrated into the model-based RL section to control the ego agent for motion\\nplanning.\\nAfter training, MPC uses a model to predict future outputs of a process. It handles multi-input multi-\\noutput (MIMO) systems with constraints and incorporates future reference information to improve\\nperformance. Therefore, we established a continuous version of the multi-billiard environment for\\ndata collection. It is possible to combine the previously trained GNN model with MPC to assess if\\nthis method can successfully address MAS tasks.\\n2.2 Data Generation\\nSTOVE proposed an object-aware physics prediction model based on billiard simulations, including\\navoidance, billiards, gravity, and multi-billiards modes. We wrapped them into a gym environment\\nstyle, \"gym-billiard,\" which can be easily used by Python API, aiding researchers in understanding\\nthis system and creating efficient algorithms.\\nOur project focuses on the avoidance billiard scenario, where the red ball is the ego-object and the\\nRL agent controls it to avoid collisions. In STOVE, the ego-ball has nine actions: movement in eight\\ndirections and staying at rest. A negative reward is given when the red ball hits another. We obtained\\nthe avoidance sequences datasets using the \"generate_billiards_w_actions\" function. 1000 sequences\\n2of length 100 for training and 300 sequences of length 100 for testing were generated using a random\\naction selection policy. The pixel resolution was 32*32 with the ball mass set to 2.0.\\nWe changed the environment to use continuous actions for agents, where the red ball is controlled by\\n2-dimensional numpy values ranging in (-2, 2), representing the acceleration in x and y directions.\\nSimilar to the discrete setting, continuous datasets were produced with random actions from a uniform\\ndistribution within (-2, 2). These datasets included the image observations, actions, states, dones,\\nand rewards. The average rewards for the continuous mode are lower, indicating more frequent\\ninteractions between the balls.\\nTable 1: Basic comparisons of the continuous and discrete datasets.\\nData Mode Action space Actions dtype Average Rewards of training data Average Rewards of testing data\\nDiscrete 9 One-hot mode -17.276 -16.383\\nContinuous 2 Numpy array -18.93 -18.71\\n2.3 GNN Dynamics Model Training\\nWe used supervised learning to train on ground-truth states rather than high-dimensional image data.\\nThe aim is to improve sample efficiency, then combine the trained model with CEM-optimized MPC\\nfor predicting future states. Two cases were trained on both Discrete and Continuous datasets: (1) the\\nAction-conditioned case, which makes predictions based on state and action and predicts reward, and\\n(2) the Supervised RL case, where real states including positions and velocities were used as the input\\nfor GNN dynamics model. The model can learn to predict future states of multiple agents instead of\\nfirst extracting the states from visual data with a separate model. Training was performed for 500\\nepochs, and the model parameters were saved. Training time for the Supervised condition was less\\nthan the Action-conditioned case. The GNN model could work on both action space 2 and 9 discrete\\nactions without changing the GNN network architecture, resulting in a unified training framework.\\n2.4 GNN with MBRL\\nFollowing traditional Model-based RL, the trained GNN model was combined with CEM-optimized\\nMPC to assess performance on the continuous gym-billiard avoidance task. The saved GNN model\\npredicts future states, and the MPC searches for optimal actions for the ego-agent. The search is\\nrepeated after each step to account for prediction errors and rewards, incorporating feedback from the\\nenvironment. We also conducted experiments on discrete datasets using MCTS and saved videos.\\nFor the continuous case, the GNN dynamics model was combined with CEM optimized MPC and\\ncompared with random and ground truth scenarios.\\n3 Results\\n3.1 GNN Training Results\\nThe datasets generated from the gym-billiard API environment, including image observations, actions,\\nstates, dones, and rewards, were stored in pickle files. GNN dynamics models were trained in two\\nconditions: (1) Action-conditioned case, which used video sequences with a visual reconstruction\\nmodel, and (2) Supervised RL case, which used real states as input for the GNN dynamics model.\\nBoth conditions were trained for 500 epochs. The Supervised condition took less time to train than\\nthe Action-conditioned case. A notable finding is that the GNN model worked equally well for both\\naction space 2 and 9 discrete actions without changing the original GNN architecture. This allows for\\nunified training for both the Discrete and Continuous billiard avoidance environments. After training,\\nmodel parameters were saved in the \"checkpoints\" folder. \"gifs\" folder stores the videos, and \"states\"\\ncontains state and reward files.\\nIn the Action-conditioned case, the reward MSE loss decreases for both continuous and discrete\\nconditions. However, the continuous reward error decreased from 0.48 to 0, while the discrete one\\ndropped from 0.16 to 0. The ELBO increased significantly from 450 to 3600. Position and velocity\\nprediction errors decreased during training. The continuous position error was close to the discrete,\\n3but the velocity error showed a greater difference. The continuous V_error dropped from 0.65 to 0.05,\\nwhile the discrete one decreased from 0.07 to 0.01. The four metrics met the criteria for a reasonable\\nGNN dynamics model for the subsequent RL task. In the Supervised RL case, the model directly\\ninputs the ground truth states and actions for GNN training to predict future states. Reconstruction\\nerrors were always zero since no image reconstruction was used on the true states. The discrete case\\nshowed a better performance compared to the continuous case with respect to the \"Prediction_error\".\\nThe continuous loss remained stable for “Total_error”, while the discrete loss showed a downtrend\\nbefore stabilizing. Generated rollout videos indicated that the ego-red ball performed reasonably\\nwell in avoiding collisions. Thus, the trained Supervised RL model can be used for the following\\nmodel-based RL phase.\\n3.2 GNN with MBRL\\nIn the \"Model-based Control\" framework, we used MCTS on discrete datasets to generate qualitative\\nvideos. We changed the mass of the ball agents to 1.0 and 2.0 and trained two GNN dynamics models.\\nDuring MCTS, the GNN model predicted future sequences for 100 parallel environments with the\\nlength of 100, using a maximal rollout depth of 10. We then calculated the mean collision rate and\\nsaved 100 videos to show the ego-ball’s interaction with other agents, which demonstrates improved\\ncollision avoidance and lower collision rates.\\nFor the continuous datasets, we combined the trained GNN model into the CEM optimized MPC\\nmethod and compared it with random and ground truth cases. The GNN model made accurate\\npredictions based on the current states by checking the code, changing the cuda device and data type.\\nWe computed the \"reward,\" the average collisions per epoch, for each method.\\nTable 2: Reward (Collision Rate) for two envs with different baselines.\\nEnvs Epochs Horizons GNN_MPC Random Ground_truth\\nm=1 100 50 0.0558+0.0012 0.2790+0.025 0.0707+0.066\\nm=1 50 100 0.0565+0.0008 0.3543+0.0445 0.0408+0.0392\\nm=2 100 50 0.0648+0.001 0.2420+0.0178 0.0505+0.0480\\nm=2 50 100 0.0455+0.0008 0.2690+0.0350 0.0612+0.0575\\nThe \"random\" case used randomly generated actions, while \"ground_truth\" used the true interaction\\nenvironment for generating next states. The \"m=1\" version task differed slightly from \"m=2\" as the\\n\"m=1\" model was trained on the old continuous datasets, making the red ball movement less flexible.\\nThe collision rates in \"GNN_MPC\" were lower than \"Random\" and close to \"ground_truth\". The\\nperformance of our proposed method was better than random cases, and the results of \"GNN_MPC\"\\nwere close to the \"Ground_truth\" case, which indicated that the trained GNN dynamics model predicts\\nthe future states of multi-object systems as well as the ground truth interactive environment.\\n4 Conclusions\\nWe introduced the \"GNN for MBRL\" concept, combining a graph neural network (GNN) dynamics\\nmodel with CEM-optimized Model Predictive Control (MPC) on a gym-billiard avoidance MAS task.\\nWe also conducted experiments on the \"Action-conditioned\" case with MCTS using discrete datasets\\nand explored the \"Supervised RL\" GNN dynamics model with CEM-optimized MPC on continuous\\ndatasets. The proposed model predicted video sequences well and controlled the ego-agent to address\\nRL tasks, which may be applied to complex multi-agent systems like the gym-carla autonomous\\ndriving environment.\\n4'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'A Toolkit for Scrutinizing Neural Network Activations\\nAbstract\\nThis document introduces diagNNose, an open-source toolkit designed for the\\nexamination of activations within deep neural networks. diagNNose offers a diverse\\ncollection of interpretability methods, enabling a deeper understanding of the\\noperational dynamics of neural networks. The utility of diagNNose is showcased\\nthrough an investigation into subject-verb agreement in language models.\\n1 Introduction\\nWe present diagNNose, a publicly available library for analyzing the behavior of\\ndeep neural networks. The diagNNose library equips researchers with tools to gain\\nenhanced understanding of the internal representations formed by these networks,\\nproviding a comprehensive suite of established analysis methods. It accommodates\\na variety of model types, with a particular focus on NLP architectures, such as\\nLSTMs and Transformers.\\nThe availability of open-source libraries has been instrumental in the advancement\\nand wider adoption of NLP technologies. We enhance the open-source ecosystem\\nby integrating several interpretability techniques.\\nRecent years have witnessed significant interest in enhancing our understanding of\\nthe mechanisms by which deep neural networks function. The high-dimensional\\narchitecture of these models makes deciphering their internal dynamics a complex\\nendeavor. This complexity has spurred the emergence of a specialized subfield\\nwithin AI, dedicated to interpretability. diagNNose seeks to consolidate a range of\\nthese interpretability techniques into a unified library.\\nThe primary objective of diagNNose is to facilitate the discovery of linguistic\\nknowledge encoded within a model’s representations. The library offers abstrac-\\ntions that enable the investigation of recurrent models in a manner similar to\\nTransformer models, using a modular design. It includes a module for extracting\\nmodel activations. The analysis methods currently implemented in the library\\ninclude targeted syntactic evaluation tasks, probing with diagnostic classifiers, and\\nfeature attributions.\\nThis paper provides a comprehensive overview of the library and illustrates its\\napplication in a case study centered on subject-verb agreement within language\\nmodels. Subsequently, we provide a survey of diagNNose and elaborate on its\\nspecific modules. We conclude with the case study.\\n2 Background\\nThe increasing capabilities of language models have resulted in a vibrant area of\\nresearch focused on understanding their functionality. Approaches in this field\\nare frequently interdisciplinary. diagNNose facilitates several influential analysis\\nmethods.\\n2.1 Targeted Syntactic Evaluations\\nLanguage models have been central to numerous achievements in NLP. These\\nmodels are trained to predict the probability of upcoming or masked tokens. Toachieve success in this task, models must grasp various linguistic aspects, including\\nsyntax, semantics, and general domain knowledge. One notable area of research\\ninvestigating a model’s linguistic competence employs targeted syntactic evalu-\\nations. This analysis method contrasts a model’s outputs on minimally different\\npairs of grammatical and ungrammatical constructions. If a model assigns a higher\\nprobability to the grammatical construction, it suggests an understanding of the\\nrelevant linguistic principles.\\ndiagNNose supports a diverse set of syntactic tasks and offers an interface for\\nincorporating new tasks seamlessly.\\n2.2 Diagnostic Classifiers\\nAnother line of research evaluates a model’s comprehension of linguistic properties\\nby training diagnostic classifiers on its representations. This technique, also known\\nas probing, has yielded valuable insights into the internal mechanisms of language\\nmodels. The activations used for training these classifiers are not limited to the\\nhidden states of a language model at its top layer.\\nThere have been recent discussions regarding the extent to which high accuracy in a\\ndiagnostic classifier truly signifies that a property is actively encoded by the model.\\nSeveral methods have been put forward to address this, such as using control tasks\\nor assessing classifiers based on minimum description length. diagNNose currently\\nsupports the training of diagnostic classifiers and control tasks.\\n2.3 Feature Attributions\\nWhile probing helps us identify specific properties embedded in model repre-\\nsentations, it does not clarify how a model converts input features into accurate\\npredictions. This can be addressed by calculating the contributions of input fea-\\ntures to subsequent outputs. This is a complex task due to the high-dimensional,\\nnon-linear nature of deep learning models.\\nFeature attributions can be calculated in various manners. One common method\\ninvolves a concept from cooperative game theory, referred to as the Shapley value.\\nComputing Shapley values is computationally intensive, leading to the develop-\\nment of several approximation algorithms. diagNNose currently supports feature\\nattribution computation using Contextual Decomposition and its generalization.\\n3 Library Overview\\n3.1 Modules\\nThe library is organized into multiple modules that can be utilized as components\\nfor constructing an experimental pipeline.\\n3.1.1 Core Modules\\nThe foundational modules underpinning the various pipelines that can be built\\nusing diagNNose are detailed below.\\n**models:** We offer a generalized framework for language models, enabling\\nboth recurrent and Transformer models to be accessed through a unified interface.\\nImporting pre-trained Transformer models is accomplished using the transform-\\ners library. For recurrent models, we provide an interface that allows access to\\nintermediate activations, including gate activations.\\n**corpus:** Corpora are imported as Datasets from the torchtext package. A\\nCorpus can be converted into an iterator for processing. Tokenization can be\\nperformed traditionally, token-by-token, or based on subword units, such as byte\\npair encodings.\\n**extract:** The extraction of activations is fundamental to most analysis modules.\\nWe provide an Extractor class capable of extracting a model’s activations given a\\ncorpus. This process is not restricted to the top layer; intermediate (gate) activations\\ncan also be extracted. Activations can be dynamically saved to disk to facilitate the\\nextraction from large corpora with limited computational resources.\\n2**activations:** Extracted activations can be readily accessed using an Activation-\\nReader, which provides access to activations corresponding to specific subsets of\\ncorpus sentences. We also offer functionality for extracting only particular subsets\\nof activations, based on sentence and token information.\\n**config:** The pipeline of diagNNose is driven by configuration defined in JSON\\nformat. Individual attributes can also be directly set from the command line.\\n3.1.2 Analysis Modules\\nWe presently offer three primary types of experimental modules.\\n**syntax:** The library offers capabilities for a broad range of targeted syntactic\\nevaluation tasks.\\n**probe:** We furnish convenient tools for training diagnostic classifiers on ex-\\ntracted activations to probe for linguistic information that may be embedded within\\nthem. Our extraction module also enables training diagnostic classifiers on in-\\ntermediate activations, including gate activations. To address concerns that high\\nprobing accuracy does not necessarily indicate that linguistic information is actively\\nencoded, we have incorporated functionality for Control Tasks.\\n**attribute:** We offer capabilities for model-agnostic feature attributions, en-\\nabling the decomposition of a model’s output into a sum of contributions. This\\nis accomplished by implementing a wrapper over PyTorch operations, allowing\\nintermediate feature contributions to be propagated during a forward pass. Our\\nimplementation supports various Shapley-based attribution methods and facili-\\ntates approximation procedures such as (Generalized) Contextual Decomposition\\nand Shapley sampling values, in addition to the exact computation of propagated\\nShapley values.\\n3.2 Requirements\\ndiagNNose can be installed using pip (pip install diagnnose) or cloned directly\\nfrom the GitHub repository. The library is compatible with Python 3.6 or later,\\nand its primary dependencies are PyTorch (v1.5+), torchtext, and HuggingFace’s\\ntransformers. diagNNose is released under the MIT License. It operates on both\\nCPUs and GPUs and has been optimized for smaller consumer setups.\\nThe diagNNose codebase is fully typed using Python type hints and formatted\\nusing Black. All methods and classes are documented, with an overview available\\nonline.\\n4 Case Study: Subject-Verb Agreement\\nTo exemplify the functionality of diagNNose, we examine subject-verb agreement\\ncorpora on a selection of language models. For our experiments, we analyze the\\nfollowing models: BERT, RoBERTa, DistilRoBERTa, and an LSTM language\\nmodel.\\n4.1 Corpora\\nThe corpora consist of seven tasks based on template-based syntactic constructions.\\nThese constructions feature an \"agreement attractor\" between the subject and the\\nverb, which may mislead a language model into predicting the incorrect number of\\nthe verb. Consequently, a model must possess a robust understanding of sentence\\nstructure.\\nThe seven tasks are defined by the following templates:\\n* SIMPLE: The athletes approve * ADV: The uncle probably avoids * 2ADV: The\\nathlete most probably understands * COADV: The farmer overtly and deliberately\\nknows * NAMEPP: The women near John remember * NOUNPP: The athlete\\nbeside the tables approves * NOUNPPADV: The aunt behind the bikes certainly\\nknows\\n3Each task encompasses 600 to 900 distinct sentences. Sentences are categorized\\ninto multiple conditions based on the number of the subject and the intervening\\nnoun phrase.\\nTo assess these corpora on a recurrent model, we initially compute the model’s\\nhidden state at the verb’s position by feeding it the sub-sentence up to that point.\\nBased on this hidden state, we compute and compare the output probabilities of the\\nverb with the correct number (vc) and the incorrect number (vx):\\nP(vc | he) > P(vx | he)\\nFor bi-directional masked language models, such as BERT, we cannot compute\\nan intermediate hidden state by passing a sub-sentence because these models also\\nincorporate input from future tokens. To address this, we substitute the verb in\\neach sentence with a <mask> token and evaluate the model’s probabilities at this\\ntoken’s position.\\nMany contemporary language models employ BPE tokenization, which may seg-\\nment a word into multiple subwords. Therefore, in our experiments, we only\\ncompare verb forms where both the plural and singular forms are split into a single\\ntoken.\\n4.2 Targeted Syntactic Evaluations\\nWe execute the targeted syntactic evaluation suite on all seven templates. The\\nresults of this experiment are presented in Table 1.\\nTable 1: Results of the targeted syntactic evaluation tasks.\\nCorpus Condition BERT RoBERTa DistilRoBERTa LSTM\\nSIMPLE S 100 100 100 100\\nP 100 100 100 100\\nADV S 100 100 100 100\\nP 100 100 100 99.6\\n2ADV S 100 100 100 99.2\\nP 100 100 100 99.3\\nCOADV S 100 100 100 98.7\\nP 100 100 100 99.3\\nNAMEPP SS 93.0 75.7 81.5 99.3\\nPS 88.4 65.9 32.4 68.9\\nNOUNPP SS 95.7 88.9 98.1 99.2\\nSP 93.3 84.7 91.1 87.2\\nPS 96.7 90.6 85.3 92.0\\nPP 100 100 100 99.0\\nNOUNPPADV SS 99.6 100 100 99.5\\nSP 99.2 99.8 100 91.2\\nPS 100 100 100 99.2\\nPP 100 100 100 99.8\\nIt is evident that Transformer language models generally attain higher scores\\ncompared to the LSTM model. Notably, the NAMEPP task presents a challenge for\\nall models, with both RoBERTa and DistilRoBERTa scoring lower on this task than\\nthe LSTM. Another intriguing observation is the disparity in performance between\\nRoBERTa and DistilRoBERTa on the NAMEPP and NOUNPP tasks. Despite\\nDistilRoBERTa being trained to mimic RoBERTa’s behavior, its performance on\\na downstream task like this differs considerably. These findings can serve as a\\nfoundation for more detailed analysis.\\n4.3 Feature Attributions\\nTo gain a deeper understanding of why language models exhibit particularly poor\\nperformance on the NAMEPP corpus, we employ the feature attribution module on\\nthese constructions. The results for this experiment are presented below, illustrating\\n4the attributions for DistilRoBERTa on an example sentence from the corpus. This\\nhighlights the differential impact of the intervening attractor on the verb’s number.\\nThe score at the top of the attribution represents the model’s full logit for that\\nclass; these logits are transformed into probabilities using SoftMax. This logit is\\ndecomposed into a sum of contributions, indicated at the bottom of each token.\\nIt can be verified that the contributions sum to the logit, which is an important\\ncharacteristic of feature attribution methods, ensuring a degree of faithfulness to\\nthe model. A negative value signifies a negative feature contribution to an output\\nclass: the influence of that feature diminished the preference for the class. Feature\\nattributions also incorporate the influence of model biases.\\nIn the provided example sentence, DistilRoBERTa produces an incorrect prediction:\\nthe logit of the incorrect singular form ’approves’ is greater than that of the plural\\n’approve’. The model’s error in predicting the correct verb form arises from the\\nsubject ’athletes’ not providing sufficient contribution to outweigh the negative\\ncontributions from other input features. A model with a comprehensive grasp of\\nsubject-verb agreement should assign a larger contribution to the subject when\\npredicting the main verb.\\nThe attribute module is under active development. The exponential complexity of\\ncomputing Shapley values makes generating these explanations a challenging task.\\n5 Conclusion\\ndiagNNose offers crucial tools for interpretability research, providing advanced\\nanalysis techniques such as diagnostic classifiers and feature attributions. The\\nlibrary’s modular architecture enables rapid testing of complex hypotheses and es-\\ntablishes a robust groundwork for the development of new interpretability methods.\\nThe library’s code is open-source, and contributions are encouraged.\\n5'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'A Decentralized Local Stochastic Extragradient\\nApproach for Variational Inequalities\\nAbstract\\nThis study examines distributed stochastic variational inequalities (VIs) within\\nunbounded domains, where the problem data is heterogeneous, meaning it is non-\\nidentically distributed and spread across numerous devices. We adopt a broad\\nassumption regarding the computational network, which encompasses fully de-\\ncentralized computations with dynamic networks and the centralized structures\\ncommonly employed in Federated Learning. Additionally, we allow multiple local\\nupdates on the workers to reduce how often they communicate. We adapt the\\nstochastic extragradient method to this versatile framework, and conduct theoreti-\\ncal analysis on its convergence rate, specifically in strongly-monotone, monotone,\\nand non-monotone scenarios (given that a Minty solution is available). The rates\\nwe provide demonstrate a clear relationship with various network properties like\\nmixing time, the number of iterations, data heterogeneity, variance, the quantity\\nof devices, and other typical parameters. As a particular application, our method\\nand analysis can be used for distributed stochastic saddle-point problems (SPP),\\nsuch as the training of Deep Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which is\\nknown to be very difficult when using decentralized training. The experiments we\\nperform for decentralized GANs training demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed\\napproach.\\n1 Introduction\\nIn extensive machine learning (ML) situations, training data is often split among multiple devices\\nlike data centers or mobile devices. Decentralized training methods can produce an ML model\\nwith the same accuracy as if all data were on a single server. Moreover, decentralized training has\\nadvantages over traditional centralized methods including data ownership, privacy, fault tolerance, and\\nscalability. Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized learning approach where the training process\\nis managed by a single device or server that communicates with all the participating clients. However,\\nin fully decentralized learning (FD) scenarios, devices only communicate with their neighbors via a\\ncommunication network with an arbitrary structure. Therefore, decentralized algorithms are valuable\\nwhen centralized communication is expensive, undesirable, or impossible.\\nRecently, significant advances have been made in the creation, design, and understanding of decen-\\ntralized training methods. In particular, aspects such as data heterogeneity, communication efficiency,\\nwhich includes local updates or compression, and personalization have been explored. However,\\nthese advancements have focused on training with single-criterion loss functions, which lead to\\nminimization problems, and are not applicable to more general types of problems. For instance,\\ntraining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) requires the simultaneous competing optimization\\nof the generator and discriminator objectives, which translates to solving a non-convex-non-concave\\nsaddle-point problem (SPP). This kind of problem structure makes GANs extremely challenging to\\ntrain, even in the single-node setting, let alone when training over decentralized datasets.\\nThis study centers around solving decentralized stochastic SPPs and, more broadly, decentralized\\nstochastic Minty variational inequalities (MVIs). In a decentralized stochastic MVI, data is distributed\\n.across M or more devices/nodes. Each device m has access to its own local stochastic oracle Fm(z, m)\\nfor the local operator Fm(z) := EmDmFm(z, m). The data m in device m follows a distribution Dm,\\nwhich can vary across devices. The devices are connected via a communication network, allowing\\ntwo devices to exchange information only if their corresponding nodes are connected by an edge in\\nthe network graph. The objective is to find cooperatively a point z* Rn that satisfies the inequality:\\nMX\\nm=1\\nE[Fm(z∗), z− z∗] ≥ 0 (1)\\nfor all z Rn.\\nA specific instance of decentralized stochastic MVIs is the decentralized stochastic SPP with local\\nobjectives fm(x, y) := EmDm[fm(x, y, m)]:\\nmin\\nx∈Rn\\nmax\\ny∈Rm\\nMX\\nm=1\\nfm(x, y) (2)\\nThe connection to VI can be seen by setting z = (x, y) and the gradient field F(z) = (xf(x, y), -yf(x,\\ny)). In cases where f(x,y) is convex-concave, the operator F(z) is monotone. However, in the context\\nof GANs training, where x and y are parameters of the generator and discriminator, respectively, the\\nlocal losses fm(x, y) are generally non-convex-non-concave in x, y, and monotonicity of F cannot be\\nassumed.\\nIn this study, we develop a new algorithm for addressing problems (1) and (2). Because gradient\\ndescent-ascent for problem (2) can diverge even in simple convex-concave settings with a single\\ndevice, we use extragradient updates and combine them with a gossip-type communication protocol\\non arbitrary, possibly dynamic, network topologies. One challenge arising from communication\\nconstraints is a “network error” that stems from the inability of all devices to achieve exact consensus.\\nTherefore, each device uses a local variable, with only approximate consensus among devices\\nachieved through gossip steps. Our method avoids multiple gossip steps per iteration, leading to\\nbetter practical performance on dynamic networks. It also allows multiple local updates between\\ncommunication rounds to reduce communication overhead, making it suitable for communication-\\nand privacy-restricted FL or fully decentralized scenarios.\\nOur Contributions:\\n1. We have created an algorithm that uses extragradient updates to tackle distributed stochas-\\ntic MVIs, and consequently distributed stochastic SPPs, with heterogeneous data. This\\nframework offers a flexible communication protocol that supports centralized settings like\\nFederated Learning, fully decentralized configurations, local steps in both centralized and\\ndecentralized setups, and dynamic network topologies.\\n2. Using this general communication protocol, we have demonstrated the convergence of our\\nalgorithm in three MVI settings, namely where the operator is strongly-monotone, monotone,\\nor non-monotone (assuming a Minty condition is met). The rates of convergence depend\\nexplicitly on several problem parameters, such as network characteristics, data heterogeneity,\\ndata variance, number of devices, and other relevant factors. These theoretical results\\ntranslate directly to the corresponding SPP settings (strongly-convex-strongly-concave,\\nconvex-concave, and non-convex-non-concave under the Minty condition). All theoretical\\nresults are valid when using heterogeneous data, and allow quantifying how factors like data\\nheterogeneity, noise in the data, and network characteristics influence convergence rate. We\\nhave also shown that for decentralized settings, our results are novel for time-varying graphs\\nand the three different monotonicity settings.\\n3. We have verified our theoretical results through numerical experiments and demonstrated the\\neffectiveness of our strategy in practice. Specifically, we have trained a DCGAN architecture\\non the CIFAR-10 dataset.\\n22 Related Work\\nResearch on MVIs dates back to at least 1962, and has been continued in recent works. VIs are\\nused in diverse applications: image denoising, game theory and optimal control, robust optimization,\\nand non-smooth optimization using smooth reformulations. In ML, MVIs and SPPs arise in GANs\\ntraining, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training.\\nThe extragradient method (EGM) was first introduced and later expanded to include deterministic\\nproblems and stochastic problems with bounded variance. However, if the stochastic noise is not\\nuniformly bounded, EGM can diverge.\\n3 Algorithm\\nThis section details our proposed algorithm (Algorithm 1) based on two main concepts: (i) the extra-\\ngradient step (as seen in classical methods for VIs), and (ii) gossip averaging (used in decentralized\\noptimization and diffusion strategies in distributed learning). Instead of using gradient descent, as\\nin similar algorithms, ours uses the extragradient method. It is designed for VIs and SPPs. It also\\nincludes local steps between communication rounds, supports dynamic networks, and comes with\\nnon-asymptotic theoretical convergence guarantees.\\nEach step of Algorithm 1 has two phases. The local phase (lines 4–6) involves a step of the stochastic\\nextragradient method at each node using only local data. Nodes make an extrapolation step “to\\nlook into the future” and then update using the operator value at the “future” point. Next is the\\ncommunication phase (line 7), during which nodes share local iterates with their neighbors Nm in the\\ncommunication network graph for each iteration k. Averaging is done using weights w k m,i, which\\nare matrix Wk elements called the mixing matrix.\\nDefinition 2.1 (Mixing matrix). A matrix W [0; 1]M ×M is a mixing matrix if it satisfies: 1) W is\\nsymmetric, 2) W is doubly stochastic (W1 = 1, 1TW = 1T, where 1 is the vector of all ones), 3) W is\\naligned with the network: wij 0 if and only if i = j or the edge (i, j) is in the communication network\\ngraph.\\nReasonable choices of mixing matrices include Wk = IM Lk /max(Lk), where Lk is the Laplacian\\nmatrix of the network graph at step k and IM is the identity matrix, or by using local rules based on\\nthe degrees of the neighboring nodes. Our setting offers great flexibility because the communication\\ngraph’s topology can change between iterations. The matrix Wk, which encodes the current network,\\nalso changes. This is encoded in line 2, where Wk is generated using a rule Wk that can vary.\\nExamples include the deterministic choice of a matrix sequence Wk or sampling from a dynamic\\nprobability distribution on matrices. Local steps without communication can be encoded with a\\ndiagonal matrix Wk.\\nAlgorithm 1 Extra Step Time-Varying Gossip Method\\nparameters: stepsize > 0, {Wk}k0 – rules or distributions for mixing matrix in iteration k.\\ninitialize: z0 Z, m : z0 m = z0\\n1: for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . do\\n2: Sample matrix Wk from Wk\\n3: for each node m do\\n4: Generate independently mk+1/3 Dm\\n5: zk+1/3 m = zk m Fm(zk m, mk+1/3 )\\n6: Generate independently mk+2/3 Dm\\n7: zk+1 = Wk m,i zk+1/3\\n8: zk+1/3\\nend for\\n9: end for\\nTo ensure consensus between nodes, the mixing properties of the matrix sequence Wk must satisfy\\nthe following assumption:\\nAssumption 2.2 (Expected Consensus Rate).

Some matrices Wk can be the identity matrix (local steps only).\\n4 Setting and Assumptions\\nThis section outlines the assumptions used to analyze the proposed algorithm:\\nAssumption 3.1 (Lipschitzness). For every m, the operator Fm(z) is Lipschitz with a constant L,\\nmeaning that:\\n||Fm(z1) − Fm(z2)|| ≤L||z1 − z2||, ∀z1, z2 (4)\\nThis is a common assumption used when analyzing all the methods in Table 1.\\nAssumption 3.2. We consider three scenarios for the operator F: (SM) Strong monotonicity, (M)\\nMonotonicity, and (NM) Non-monotonicity under the Minty condition:\\n(SM) Strong monotonicity. For some > 0 and for all z1, z2, we have:\\n(F(z1) − F(z2), z1 − z2) ≥ µ||z1 − z2||2 (5)\\n(M) Monotonicity. For all z1, z2, we have:\\n(F(z1) − F(z2), z1 − z2) ≥ 0 (6)\\n(NM) Non-monotonicity (Minty). There exists z such that, for all z,\\n(F(z), z− z∗) ≥ 0 (7)\\nAssumptions (SM), (M), and (L) are widely used in the literature. Assumption (NM), often called\\nMinty or Variational Stability, has recently been used as a non-monotonicity variant, particularly in\\nGANs training.\\nAssumption 3.3 (Bounded noise). Fm(z, ) is unbiased and has bounded variance. This means, for all\\nz:\\nE[Fm(z, ξ)] = Fm(z), E[||Fm(z, ξ) − Fm(z)||2] ≤ σ2 (8)\\nThe final assumption pertains to the variability of local operators compared to their mean, which is\\ncalled D-heterogeneity, and is commonly used when analyzing local-step algorithms.\\nAssumption 3.4 (D-heterogeneity). The values of the local operator have bounded variability:\\n||Fm(z) − ¯F(z)|| ≤D (9)\\n5 Main Results\\nThis section presents convergence rates for our proposed method under different settings de-\\nfined by Assumption 3.2. We introduce the notation z = (1/M)m=1M zk for the average iter-\\nates and Z = (1/K)k=0K-1 z for the averaged sequence, i.e., ergodic average. We denote =\\n(2/M + D2), whichistheconsensuserror.\\nTheorem 4.1 (Main theorem). Let Assumptions 2.2 and 3.1-3.4 hold, and the sequence z generated\\nby Algorithm 1 runs for K > 0 iterations. Then:\\n• Strongly-monotone case: under Assumption 3.2 (SM) with = /L 2, itholdsthat:E[||¯zK − z∗||2] ≤\\x00\\n1 − µ\\n2L\\n\\x01K\\n||z0 − z∗||2 + γL2∆\\nµ (10)\\n4Monotone case: under Assumption 3.2 (M), for any convex compact C with z0,z C and Q = maxz,z’C\\n||z - z’|| < Qc, with = O(min1/(K 0.5L), (1/L)(p/), itholdsthat:\\nsup\\nz∈C\\nE[(F(¯zK), ¯zK − z)] ≤ L2Q2\\nc\\nK + (L\\np\\nQc∆ + ∆)\\ns\\nQ√\\nK\\n(11)\\nUnder the assumption that for all k, ||zk||Qwith = O(min1/KL, p/), wehave:\\nsup\\nz∈C\\nE[(F(¯z), ¯z − z)] ≤ O(LQ2\\nK ) + O(L∆Q√\\nK\\n) (12)\\nNon-monotone case: under Assumption 3.2 (NM) and if ||z ∗||Qwith = O(min1/KL, p/),||z −\\nz∗||2 ≤ LQ2\\nK + L2∆\\nµ + LQ\\nK1/4 (13)Under the additional assumption that, for all k,\\n||zk||Q, wehavethatE[||¯zK − z∗||2] ≤ LQ2\\nK + L2∆Q\\nK1/4 (14)\\nThe proof of the theorem can be found in the supplementary materials, where the dependence of\\nrates on the stepsize before optimal selection are given. In contrast to other analyses, our analysis\\naddresses the fact that problem (1) has no feasible bounded set, which is important for analysis in\\nboth monotone and non-monotone settings. Furthermore, our algorithm includes a communication\\nstep that introduces a bias in the oracle, which needs to be analyzed over unbounded feasible sets.\\nWe overcome this by bounding the bias, and proving the boundedness in expectation of the sequence\\nof iterates for both monotone and non-monotone cases. We also analyze stochastic extragradient\\nmethod with biased oracles on unbounded domains which has not been done before. We achieve this\\nunder a general Assumption 2.2, with time varying graphs and all three monotonicity settings.\\nThe convergence rates explicitly depend on the network, characterized by mixing time and mixing\\nfactor p, and on data heterogeneity D, which appear only as the quantity , the variance 2, Lipschitz\\nconstant L, strong monotonicity parameter , and the number of nodes M. These results help us\\ndetermine how data heterogeneity, noise, and network characteristics influence convergence. This\\nopens meta-optimization opportunities to design networks and set parameters such as M, , and p to\\nimprove convergence.\\nThe convergence results presented in the theorem have a similar multi-term structure. The first term\\nis from the deterministic case and mirrors existing methods for smooth VIs in a non-distributed\\nsetting. The second term is stochastic and is also standard for the non-distributed setting. The leading\\nstochastic term is proportional to 2/M, decreasing with the number of nodes. Other terms represent\\na consensus error, due to imperfect communication between nodes. In all the cases this does not\\nworsen the convergence, because dependence on K is no worse than the stochastic term.\\nTheorem 4.1 is given for a fixed iteration budget K, and corresponding stepsizes that depend on K,\\nwhich is standard in literature. We also offer a procedure that allows extending the result to all-time\\nconvergence without a priori fixed K, by restarting the algorithm after K iterations, which are doubled\\neach time.\\nIn the strongly monotone case, our rate is slightly better than other results. The other methods’\\nstepsize is limited as p/(L2), slowing convergence. For decentralized settings, our rate is worse,\\nprobably because Assumption 2.2 is more general, but our algorithm is more practical because it\\navoids multiple gossip steps per iteration and works with time-varying topologies. In the monotone\\ncase, we use the Gap function as a measure of suboptimality. And in the non-monotone setting we are\\nable to obtain convergence up to a certain accuracy. It is important to note that we use assumptions\\nabout iterates that we can obtain only when they are generated by the algorithm. We manage to obtain\\ncorresponding results that can be used for establishing that the algorithm behaves nicely under certain\\ninitial conditions. The experimental section will demonstrate these theoretical findings.\\n6 Experiments\\nHere we present two experiments to validate the performance of Algorithm 1. Section 5.1 verifies the\\nobtained convergence guarantees on two examples, a strongly-monotone and a monotone bilinear\\nproblem. Section 5.2 uses a non-monotone case with a GAN training application. Full details about\\nthe experimental setup are available in the supplementary material.\\n56.1 Verifying Theoretical Convergence Rate\\nThis experiment aims to determine whether Algorithm 1’s actual performance matches our theoretical\\nrate from Theorem 4.1.\\nWe consider a distributed bilinear saddle point problem (SPP) with the objective functions:\\nfm(x, y) = a∥x∥2 + b⟨y, Cmx⟩,\\nwhere x, y, Cm ∈ Rn, and a, bare real numbers.\\nThis setup satisfies the assumptions with constants:\\nµ = a, L = a2 + b2, D = max\\nm\\n∥Cm∥.\\nThe network uses M = 20 nodes with uniform averaging weights. The dimension is n = 5, b = 1,\\nD ≈ 3, and τ = 1. The p value is approximately 0.288.\\nTo obtain stochastic gradients, unbiased Gaussian noise with variance σ2 is added.\\nConvergence Behaviour. The convergence of Algorithm 1 with a fixed stepsize in both the strongly-\\nmonotone (a = 1) and monotone (a = 0) settings. In the strongly monotone setting we observe linear\\nconvergence up to an error floor determined by the noise and problem parameters. The monotone\\ncase converges more slowly, but is still linear up to a level. This is expected for bilinear problems. We\\nsee that when a constant stepsize is used in stochastic optimization algorithms, convergence is usually\\nlimited to a certain neighborhood, see Theorem 2 in a previous study. Theorem 4.1 also reflects this;\\nconvergence with zero error requires a diminishing stepsize. In the supplementary material, we also\\nvalidate with decreasing stepsize.\\nWe verify the dependence on the heterogeneity parameter D and set the noise σ2 = 0. Based on\\nthe theory, we expect that the error when σ = 0 scales as O(D2K−2). We conduct experiments by\\nsetting b = 1 and a = 1, and measuring how many iterations are needed for\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r\\n1\\nM\\nX\\nm\\nzk − z∗\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\r < ϵ,\\nwhile varying D. The step size is tuned for every experiment.\\nThe number of iterations scale as K ≈ ϵ−4, confirming that the error depends on K as O(K−1/2).\\nThe middle plot shows that iterations scale proportionally to D (D ≈ K). Lastly, we see the number\\nof iterations to reach ϵ = 0.01 while varying the graph parameter p, and observe D ≈ p · K. This\\nmeans that experiments confirm the O\\n\\x10\\n1\\np DK2\\n\\x11\\nterm in the convergence rate.\\n6.2 Training GANs\\nOur method allows for combining communication graph topologies and local steps during distributed\\nlearning. This section explores our method on GANs training. In Section A.1, we discuss the\\nrelevance of our theoretical results to GANs training.\\nData and model. We use the CIFAR-10 dataset which includes 60,000 images across 10 classes. We\\nincrease the dataset four times by adding transformations and noise, and simulate a distributed set\\nup using 16 nodes on two GPUs with Ray. We create heterogeneity by splitting the dataset into 16\\nsubsets where a major class makes up 20% of the data and the rest is split uniformly between all the\\nother classes. We use the DCGAN architecture, conditioned by class labels, similar to a previous\\npaper. We use Adam as the optimizer. We make one local Adam step and one gossip averaging step\\nwith time-varying matrices Wk, similarly to Algorithm 1.\\nSettings. We compare the following topologies, with respective matrices Wk:\\n• Full. A full graph is used at the end of each epoch; otherwise, local steps are taken. This\\nleads to 120 communication rounds per epoch.\\n• Local. A full graph is used every five epochs; otherwise, local steps are taken. This means\\n24 communication rounds per epoch on average.\\n6• Clusters. At the end of each epoch, clique clusters of size 4 are formed randomly (4 cliques\\nin total). This results in 24 communication rounds per epoch.\\nThe first topology has a 5x larger communication budget.\\nThe learning rate is 0.002 for both generator and discriminator. The rest of the parameters are in the\\nsupplementary material.\\n7 Results\\nThe methods reach a similar convergence in terms of local epochs and produced similar images.\\nThe Local and Cluster topologies perform much better in terms of communication, with the Cluster\\ntopology slightly outperforming the Local.\\n8 Conclusion\\nWe have developed an effective algorithm to solve decentralized stochastic MVIs and SPPs, assuming\\na highly flexible network topology and communication constraints. This method represents the first\\ndecentralized extragradient approach that supports local steps for dynamic network topologies. We\\ntheoretically demonstrated the convergence rate of the algorithm for SM, M, and NM cases. In\\nnumerical experiments, we validated that the dependency on the data heterogeneity parameter D is\\ntight in the SM case and impossible to improve in general. By training DCGAN in a decentralized\\nmanner, we showed our method’s effectiveness for practical DL tasks. Future work could extend\\nthese algorithms to infinite-dimensional problems.\\n7'},\n",

In this paper, we propose our solution to\\nthe third Agriculture-Vision Challenge. We leverage a data pre-processing scheme\\nand several Transformer-based models as well as data augmentation techniques to\\nachieve a mIoU of 0.582, accomplishing the 2nd place in this challenge.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper addresses the critical Computer vision applications in agricultural domain has become\\none of hot topics nowadays, especially using remote sensing satellite images and aerial images. With\\nthe rapid development of deep learning methods, numerous research studies have proposed pioneer\\nand practical solutions to various computer vision problems in agriculture. Aside from fruitful\\nresearch achievements, various algorithm challenges have been held at top-tier conferences for\\nglobal researchers in recent years, in order to explore more effective algorithms to solve the specific\\nproblems. The Agriculture-Vision Challenge is one of most famous and competitive challenges in\\nthis inter-disciplinarity study. It aims at applying computer vision algorithms to agricultural pattern\\nrecognition from high-resolution aerial images. This year, holds the 3rd Agriculture-Vision Challenge,\\nand we form our team to participate in this contest.\\n2 Related Work\\nThis section reviews\\n3 Methodology\\nThis section details of In this section, we elaborate on the given datasets, the pre-processing method,\\nthe proposed deep learning-based framework, and the test-time augmentation (TTA) strategy.\\n3.1 Description of Dataset\\nThe challenge this year provides the entire Agriculture-Vision dataset. It contains 94,986 aerial\\nfarmland images collected throughout 2019 across the U.S. Each image has a size of 512×512 pixels\\nand has 4 channels (RGB and NIR). A total of 9 label classes are manually labeled for every image.\\nTable 1 shows the given amount of images in each class. Note that many images have multiple labels,\\nand even have overlapped labels (one pixel has multiple labels).\\nAlthough the amount of the given training data is considerable, we still generate more data following\\nthe data augmentation scheme of the winner solution last year. They conducted an image mosaic\\n.scheme to enable the model to have multi-scale views during the training. To fit the model input\\nsize, we create two new datasets using mosaicked images with down-sampling 2X (2 times) and\\ndown-sampling 3X. The down-sampling dataset has the same image size of 512×512 pixels that the\\nrecognition model can share the same network architecture among 1X, 2X, and 3X imagery.\\n3.2 Data Pre-Processing\\nWe observe that the image counts in each category are uneven. For example, the image count of the\\nbackground class is 25 times larger than the water class. To tackle the unbalance issue, we try to\\nsample more images in the few-shot classes. The re-sampled image counts are listed in Table 1.\\nTable 1: Information of the given and resampled datasets for training and validation categories.\\nClass Index Class Name Original Amount (Train/Val) Resampled Amount (Train/Val)\\n0 Background 56944 / 18334 75121 / 13642\\n1 Double Plant 6234 / 2322 10961 / 2294\\n2 Drydown 16806 / 5800 19320 / 3383\\n3 Endrow 4481 / 1755 8544 / 1858\\n4 Nutrient Deficiency 13308 / 3883 14859 / 2610\\n5 Planter Skip 2599 / 1197 5361 / 1015\\n6 Water 2155 / 987 4132 / 721\\n7 Waterway 3899 / 696 6024 / 1109\\n8 Weed Cluster 11111 / 2834 14423 / 2773\\n3.3 Framework\\nFig. 1 shows our deep learning-based framework. SegFormer is a Transformer-based efficient\\nsegmentation model. It designs a hierarchical Transformer encoder with multi-level feature outputs.\\nUnlike other cumbersome decoders, SegFormer’s decoder adopts MLP layers to aggregate multi-scale\\nfeature outputs from different layers. One of the key advantages of SegFormer is that its model size\\nis relatively small but the performance keeps outstanding. Therefore, SegFormer is suitable for this\\nchallenge due to the model size parameter limit of 150M.\\nSegFormer provides six versions with various settings of Transformer encoders, leading to different\\nmodel sizes. These six models are named from B0 to B5, with the increased model size. To follow\\nthe policy, we select Mix Transformer (MiT) B3 and Mix Transformer B2 as our training models.\\nTheir model size information can be found in Table 7 “Mix Transformer Encoder”. After obtaining\\nthe individual inference result from each model, the model ensemble is performed to predict the final\\nsegmentation results.\\n3.4 Test-Time Augmentation\\nSince our models are trained with 1X, 2X, and 3X down-sampling imagery, we conduct the same\\nprocessing on the test dataset. In addition to the scale augmentation, we include image rotation and\\nflip.\\n4 Results\\nThis section presents the results\\n4.1 Evaluation Metric\\nThe required evaluation metric is the average Intersection over Union metric (mIoU), which is defined\\nas Eq. 1 to measure the performance.\\nmIoU = 1\\nc\\ncX\\ni=1\\nArea(Pc ∩ Tc)\\nArea(Pc ∪ Tc) (1)\\n2where c is the number of label classes (8 foreground classes + 1 background class for this challenge);\\nPc and Tc are the predicted label mask and ground truth label mask of the class c, respectively.\\n4.2 Experiment Results\\nTable 2 presents our results, the baseline provided by the host Agriculture-Vision organizers, and\\nthe results of other methods. Note that other baselines evaluate their performance on the validation\\nset due to the unavailable test set. As we can see, while our single model baselines are competitive\\nwith other baselines, our proposed method effectively improves the single model performance. Even\\nthough some single models have peak performance in some classes (0.778 for “Background” and\\n0.782 for “Water”), our model ensemble enjoys the merits of multiple single models’ strength to\\nachieve the mIoU of 0.582. It also shows that our ensemble results significantly outperform other\\nbaselines and our implementation of various single models.\\nTable 2: Performance comparisons among various models.

Moreover, we examine the feasibility of employ-\\ning neural networks that are capable of learning from non-traditional data sources,\\nsuch as social media posts and crowdsourced weather reports, in order to gather\\nmore diverse and comprehensive information about current weather conditions.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe pursuit of accurate and efficient weather forecasting has been a longstanding endeavor, with\\nsignificant advancements in recent years owing to the integration of neural network architectures.\\nThese complex systems, inspired by the human brain’s neural structure, have demonstrated unparal-\\nleled capabilities in pattern recognition and predictive modeling, making them an ideal candidate\\nfor tackling the intricate and dynamic nature of atmospheric phenomena. The application of neural\\napproaches to real-time weather forecasting has opened up new avenues for improving forecast\\naccuracy, reducing latency, and enhancing the overall reliability of weather prediction systems.\\nHistorically, weather forecasting relied heavily on physical models that simulated the behavior of\\nthe atmosphere based on governing laws of physics and thermodynamics. While these models have\\nprovided a foundation for understanding and predicting weather patterns, they are often limited\\nby their complexity, computational intensity, and the need for high-quality initial and boundary\\nconditions. The advent of neural networks has introduced a paradigm shift, allowing for the direct\\nlearning of patterns from large datasets, thereby bypassing the need for explicit physical formulations.\\nThis data-driven approach has shown promising results, particularly in forecasting phenomena that\\nare difficult to model using traditional methods, such as precipitation patterns, storm tracks, and\\ntemperature fluctuations.\\nOne of the more unconventional approaches to neural weather forecasting involves the use of\\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) to create synthetic weather patterns that can be used toaugment real-world datasets, thereby enhancing model training and improving forecast accuracy. This\\nmethod, while unorthodox, leverages the adversarial process between generator and discriminator\\nnetworks to produce highly realistic weather scenarios, including extreme events that are rare in\\nhistorical records but crucial for robust forecasting models. Furthermore, the integration of chaotic\\ntheory principles into neural network design has been explored, with some researchers proposing that\\nthe inherent chaos in weather systems can be harnessed to improve predictive capabilities. This line\\nof inquiry, though speculative, suggests that embracing the chaotic nature of atmospheric dynamics\\nrather than trying to tame it could lead to breakthroughs in forecast reliability and precision.\\nThe inclusion of social media and crowd-sourced data as additional layers of information for neural\\nweather forecasting models represents another innovative, albeit somewhat untested, approach. The\\nrationale behind this method is that real-time reports from individuals can provide ground truth data\\non weather conditions, serving as a complementary or even primary source of information in areas\\nwhere traditional observation networks are sparse or nonexistent. While concerns regarding data\\nquality, reliability, and potential biases are valid, proponents argue that the sheer volume and diversity\\nof social media data could offset these drawbacks, offering a unique opportunity for models to learn\\nfrom a broader spectrum of experiences and observations.\\nIn a departure from conventional wisdom, some researchers have explored the application of neural\\nnetworks to forecast weather patterns based on astrological principles, arguing that celestial bodies\\nand their positions could exert a previously unrecognized influence on atmospheric conditions. This\\nesoteric approach, though dismissed by many as lacking a scientific basis, has surprisingly yielded\\nsome intriguing results, with certain models appearing to capture subtle patterns in weather data\\nthat correlate with planetary alignments and lunar cycles. While these findings are preliminary and\\nrequire rigorous validation, they underscore the creativity and open-mindedness that characterize the\\ncurrent landscape of neural weather forecasting research.\\nThe rise of edge computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) has also played a significant role in the\\ndevelopment of real-time weather forecasting systems, enabling the deployment of neural networks\\non remote devices and sensors. This distributed architecture allows for the processing of weather\\ndata closer to its source, reducing latency and enhancing the responsiveness of forecasting models.\\nMoreover, the proliferation of low-cost, high-performance computing platforms has democratized\\naccess to neural network development, fostering a community-driven approach to weather forecasting\\nwhere individuals and organizations can contribute their expertise and resources to improve collective\\npredictive capabilities.\\nDespite the strides made in neural approaches to weather forecasting, numerous challenges persist,\\nincluding the need for better understanding and mitigation of model biases, the development of more\\nefficient training algorithms, and the integration of multimodal data sources to enhance forecast\\naccuracy and robustness. Additionally, the interpretability of neural network models remains a\\npressing concern, as the complex, nonlinear relationships learned by these models often obfuscate\\nthe underlying decision-making processes, making it difficult to discern the physical and dynamical\\nprinciples that underpin their predictions. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the\\ncontinued advancement of neural weather forecasting, necessitating interdisciplinary collaboration\\nand innovation at the intersection of atmospheric science, computer science, and engineering.\\nIn conclusion, the field of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting is characterized\\nby a vibrant diversity of ideas, methodologies, and applications, reflecting the complexity and\\nmultifaceted nature of atmospheric phenomena. From the application of state-of-the-art neural\\nnetwork architectures to the exploration of unconventional data sources and forecasting principles,\\nresearchers are continually pushing the boundaries of what is possible in weather prediction, driven\\nby the ultimate goal of providing accurate, reliable, and timely forecasts that can inform decision-\\nmaking and mitigate the impacts of severe weather events. As the field evolves, it is likely that novel,\\nperhaps unorthodox, approaches will emerge, challenging existing paradigms and contributing to the\\ndevelopment of more sophisticated, effective, and sustainable weather forecasting systems.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe realm of real-time weather forecasting has undergone a significant transformation in recent years,\\nwith the advent of neural approaches revolutionizing the way we predict and understand weather\\npatterns. Traditionally, weather forecasting relied heavily on physical models that utilized complex\\n2equations to describe atmospheric conditions, but these models often struggled to capture the inherent\\ncomplexities and nuances of the weather. The emergence of neural networks has enabled researchers\\nto develop more sophisticated and accurate forecasting systems, capable of learning patterns and\\nrelationships within vast amounts of weather data.\\nOne of the earliest neural approaches to weather forecasting involved the use of simple feedforward\\nnetworks, which were trained on historical weather data to predict future weather conditions. These\\nearly models demonstrated promising results, but were often limited by their inability to capture\\ncomplex spatial and temporal relationships within the data. To address this limitation, researchers\\nbegan exploring the use of more advanced neural architectures, such as recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are particularly well-suited for modeling\\nsequential and spatial data.\\nRNNs, for example, have been used to model the temporal dynamics of weather patterns, allowing\\nresearchers to predict future weather conditions based on historical trends and patterns. These\\nmodels have been shown to be particularly effective in predicting short-term weather patterns, such as\\nhourly temperature and precipitation forecasts. CNNs, on the other hand, have been used to analyze\\nspatial patterns in weather data, such as cloud formations and atmospheric circulation patterns.\\nBy combining these two architectures, researchers have been able to develop more comprehensive\\nforecasting systems that capture both the spatial and temporal complexities of the weather.\\nIn addition to these traditional neural architectures, researchers have also begun exploring more\\nunconventional approaches to weather forecasting. For example, some studies have investigated\\nthe use of neural networks to predict weather patterns based on analysis of social media posts and\\nonline search queries. The idea behind this approach is that certain keywords and phrases may be\\nindicative of weather-related events, such as tweets about heavy rainfall or Facebook posts about\\nextreme heat. By analyzing these online trends, researchers believe that they can gain insights into\\nemerging weather patterns and make more accurate forecasts.\\nAnother unusual approach to weather forecasting involves the use of neural networks to analyze\\nthe sounds of nature, such as bird songs and ocean waves. The idea behind this approach is that\\nthese natural sounds may contain hidden patterns and frequencies that are related to weather patterns.\\nFor example, researchers have found that the songs of certain bird species may change in response\\nto changes in temperature and humidity, while the sounds of ocean waves may be influenced by\\nwind patterns and sea state. By analyzing these natural sounds using neural networks, researchers\\nbelieve that they can develop more accurate and holistic forecasting systems that capture the intricate\\nrelationships between the natural world and the weather.\\nFurthermore, some researchers have even explored the use of neural networks to predict weather\\npatterns based on analysis of art and music. The idea behind this approach is that certain artistic and\\nmusical themes may be reflective of weather-related moods and emotions, such as the use of stormy\\nimagery in paintings or the composition of music that evokes feelings of calmness and serenity. By\\nanalyzing these artistic and musical themes using neural networks, researchers believe that they can\\ngain insights into the emotional and psychological dimensions of weather and develop more nuanced\\nand human-centric forecasting systems.\\nIn a somewhat bizarre twist, some researchers have also investigated the use of neural networks to\\npredict weather patterns based on analysis of culinary trends and food preferences. The idea behind\\nthis approach is that certain types of cuisine may be more popular during certain types of weather,\\nsuch as the consumption of hot and spicy foods during cold weather or the preference for cool and\\nrefreshing foods during hot weather. By analyzing these culinary trends using neural networks,\\nresearchers believe that they can develop more accurate and culturally-sensitive forecasting systems\\nthat capture the complex relationships between food, culture, and weather.\\nMoreover, the use of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been explored in the context of\\nchaotic systems and complexity theory. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used\\nto model and predict the behavior of chaotic systems, such as the atmosphere and oceans, which\\nare characterized by intricate patterns and feedback loops. By analyzing these complex systems\\nusing neural networks, researchers believe that they can develop more accurate and robust forecasting\\nsystems that capture the inherent uncertainties and unpredictabilities of the weather.\\nAdditionally, the application of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been extended to the\\nrealm of climate modeling and prediction. Researchers have used neural networks to analyze and\\n3predict long-term climate trends, such as changes in global temperature and sea level rise. These\\nmodels have been shown to be particularly effective in capturing the complex relationships between\\nclimate variables and predicting future climate scenarios. By combining these climate models with\\ntraditional weather forecasting systems, researchers believe that they can develop more comprehensive\\nand integrated forecasting systems that capture both the short-term and long-term aspects of the\\nweather and climate.\\nThe use of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been explored in the context of ensemble\\nmethods and uncertainty quantification. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used to\\ngenerate ensemble forecasts, which involve combining the predictions of multiple models to produce\\na single, more accurate forecast. By analyzing the uncertainties and errors associated with each\\nmodel, researchers believe that they can develop more robust and reliable forecasting systems that\\ncapture the inherent complexities and uncertainties of the weather.\\nIn another unexpected turn, some researchers have even investigated the use of neural networks to\\npredict weather patterns based on analysis of dreams and subconscious thoughts. The idea behind\\nthis approach is that certain dreams and subconscious thoughts may be reflective of unconscious\\nweather-related anxieties and fears, such as the fear of storms or the desire for sunny weather. By\\nanalyzing these dreams and subconscious thoughts using neural networks, researchers believe that\\nthey can gain insights into the psychological and emotional dimensions of weather and develop more\\npersonalized and human-centric forecasting systems.\\nThe application of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been extended to the realm of\\nurban planning and management. Researchers have used neural networks to analyze and predict urban\\nweather patterns, such as heat islands and air quality, which are critical factors in urban planning and\\ndecision-making. By combining these urban weather models with traditional forecasting systems,\\nresearchers believe that they can develop more comprehensive and integrated forecasting systems\\nthat capture both the local and global aspects of the weather and climate.\\nFurthermore, the use of neural networks in weather forecasting has also been explored in the context\\nof sustainability and environmental impact. Researchers have found that neural networks can be used\\nto analyze and predict the environmental impacts of weather-related events, such as flooding and\\ndroughts. By developing more accurate and robust forecasting systems, researchers believe that they\\ncan help mitigate the negative impacts of these events and promote more sustainable and resilient\\ncommunities.\\nIn a somewhat surprising development, some researchers have even investigated the use of neural\\nnetworks to predict weather patterns based on analysis of fungal growth and mycological trends. The\\nidea behind this approach is that certain types of fungi may be more prevalent during certain types\\nof weather, such as the growth of mushrooms during rainy weather or the spread of fungal diseases\\nduring dry weather. By analyzing these mycological trends using neural networks, researchers\\nbelieve that they can develop more accurate and holistic forecasting systems that capture the intricate\\nrelationships between the natural world and the weather.\\nOverall, the field of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting is rapidly evolving and\\nexpanding, with new and innovative methods being developed and explored. While some of these\\napproaches may seem unconventional or even bizarre, they reflect the creativity and imagination of\\nresearchers in this field and demonstrate the vast potential of neural networks to revolutionize the\\nway we understand and predict the weather. As researchers continue to push the boundaries of what\\nis possible with neural networks, we can expect to see even more innovative and effective approaches\\nto weather forecasting emerge in the future.\\n3 Methodology\\nThe development of neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting has necessitated a multidisci-\\nplinary approach, combining advances in computer science, meteorology, and data analysis. At the\\ncore of this endeavor is the creation of complex algorithms that can interpret and predict weather\\npatterns with high accuracy. To achieve this, we have employed a range of techniques, including\\ndeep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks\\n(RNNs), which are particularly adept at analyzing spatial and temporal data respectively.\\n4One of the initial steps in our methodology involved the collection and preprocessing of large datasets\\nrelated to weather patterns. This included historical weather records from various parts of the globe,\\nsatellite imagery, and data from weather stations. It was crucial to preprocess this data to ensure it\\nwas in a format that could be efficiently analyzed by our neural networks. This involved cleaning the\\ndata to remove any inconsistencies or missing values, normalizing it to prevent features with large\\nranges from dominating the model, and transforming it into a suitable format for our neural networks.\\nFollowing data preparation, we designed and implemented several neural network architectures. The\\nfirst was a CNN-based model aimed at predicting weather patterns from satellite imagery. This\\nmodel was trained on a large dataset of satellite images, each labeled with the corresponding weather\\nconditions. The CNN was able to learn features from these images that were indicative of different\\nweather patterns, such as cloud formations and atmospheric conditions. This approach showed\\npromising results, with the model being able to predict weather conditions with a high degree of\\naccuracy.\\nIn addition to the CNN model, we also developed an RNN-based model to predict weather patterns\\nover time. This model was trained on historical weather data, including temperature, humidity,\\nwind speed, and other relevant factors. The RNN was particularly effective at capturing temporal\\ndependencies in the data, allowing it to make accurate predictions of future weather conditions. This\\nmodel was further enhanced by the incorporation of attention mechanisms, which enabled it to focus\\non the most relevant input data when making predictions.\\nHowever, in an unexpected turn, our research also explored the application of chaotic systems theory\\nto weather forecasting. By modeling weather patterns as chaotic systems, we were able to identify\\ncertain underlying principles that could be used to make predictions. This involved analyzing the\\nstrange attractors that emerged from the complex interactions within the atmosphere and using these\\nto forecast future weather patterns. While this approach may seem unorthodox, it yielded some\\nfascinating results, with certain chaotic models showing a surprising degree of accuracy in their\\npredictions.\\nFurthermore, our investigation into neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting took a peculiar\\nturn when we began to explore the potential of using generative models to create synthetic weather\\ndata. By training generative adversarial networks (GANs) on historical weather data, we were able to\\ngenerate new, realistic weather patterns that could be used to augment our training datasets. This not\\nonly helped to increase the diversity of our data but also provided a unique insight into the underlying\\nstructures of weather patterns. The synthetic data generated by the GANs was found to be remarkably\\nrealistic, with some models even producing patterns that had never been observed before in nature.\\nThe integration of these diverse approaches has led to the development of a comprehensive framework\\nfor real-time weather forecasting. By combining the strengths of CNNs, RNNs, chaotic systems\\ntheory, and generative models, we have created a system that is capable of making highly accurate\\npredictions of weather conditions. This framework is not only robust but also flexible, allowing it\\nto be adapted to various contexts and regions. Moreover, its ability to learn from experience and\\nimprove over time makes it an invaluable tool for meteorologists and researchers alike.\\nIn another unexpected direction, our research also delved into the realm of quantum computing and\\nits potential applications to weather forecasting. By leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics,\\nwe explored the possibility of developing quantum algorithms that could solve complex weather\\nforecasting problems more efficiently than classical computers. Although this line of inquiry is\\nstill in its infancy, it has already yielded some intriguing results, with certain quantum algorithms\\nshowing a significant speedup over their classical counterparts. The implications of this research are\\nprofound, suggesting that quantum computing could revolutionize the field of weather forecasting in\\nthe not-too-distant future.\\nDespite the progress made, our methodology is not without its challenges and limitations. One of\\nthe main hurdles we faced was the issue of data quality and availability. The accuracy of weather\\nforecasts is heavily dependent on the quality of the input data, and any inconsistencies or gaps in the\\ndata can significantly impact the model’s performance. Moreover, the collection of certain types of\\nweather data, such as high-resolution satellite imagery, can be expensive and logistically challenging.\\nTo address these challenges, we had to develop innovative solutions, including data augmentation\\ntechniques and novel sensor systems, to improve the quality and availability of weather data.\\n5The complexity of weather systems also poses a significant challenge to our models. Weather patterns\\nare influenced by a myriad of factors, including atmospheric conditions, ocean currents, and terrestrial\\nprocesses, making it difficult to develop models that can accurately capture these interactions. To\\novercome this, we have had to develop highly sophisticated models that can account for these complex\\ninteractions and make predictions based on a deep understanding of the underlying physics. This has\\ninvolved the incorporation of advanced techniques, such as ensemble forecasting and model output\\nstatistics, to improve the accuracy and reliability of our predictions.\\nIn conclusion, our methodology for neural approaches to real-time weather forecasting represents a\\nsignificant advancement in the field. By combining cutting-edge techniques from computer science\\nand meteorology, we have developed a robust and flexible framework that can make highly accurate\\npredictions of weather conditions. While there are still challenges to be addressed, the potential of\\nthis research to improve our understanding of weather patterns and enhance forecasting capabilities\\nis vast. As we continue to refine and expand our methodology, we are confident that it will play an\\nincreasingly important role in the field of meteorology, enabling better decision-making and more\\neffective planning in the face of complex and dynamic weather systems.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo investigate the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance, we designed a comprehen-\\nsive experimental framework that integrated both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The\\nstudy was conducted over a period of two years, covering multiple regions with diverse climatic\\nconditions and socioeconomic profiles. We began by establishing a network of community-based\\norganizations that served as hubs for data collection, participant recruitment, and policy implementa-\\ntion. These organizations played a crucial role in facilitating trust among the local population, which\\nwas essential for the success of the experiment.\\nThe experimental design involved the creation of multiple treatment groups, each receiving a different\\nvariant of the cooperative rainfall insurance policy. The policies varied in terms of premium rates,\\npayout structures, and enrollment requirements, allowing us to assess the sensitivity of outcomes\\nto these parameters. Additionally, a control group was established, consisting of individuals who\\ndid not participate in any insurance program, to provide a baseline for comparison. The selection of\\nparticipants for each group was randomized to minimize biases and ensure that the results could be\\ngeneralized across different populations.\\nOne of the innovative aspects of our approach was the incorporation of a bizarre incentive mechanism,\\ndesigned to encourage participants to adopt risk-mitigating behaviors. Specifically, we introduced\\na reward system that offered participants a chance to win a livestock animal of their choice (such\\nas a cow, goat, or chicken) if they achieved a predefined level of compliance with recommended\\nagricultural practices. This approach was based on the hypothesis that the prospect of receiving a\\ntangible, livelihood-enhancing asset would motivate individuals to take proactive steps in managing\\nclimate-related risks. While this method may seem unconventional, it was intended to tap into the\\npsychological and social aspects of decision-making, potentially leading to more sustainable and\\nresilient outcomes.\\nThe data collection process was multifaceted, involving both survey-based instruments and observa-\\ntional studies. We conducted extensive interviews with participants to gather information on their\\nsocioeconomic status, agricultural practices, risk perceptions, and experiences with the insurance\\nprogram. Furthermore, we implemented a monitoring system to track key indicators such as crop\\nyields, soil health, and water usage patterns. This comprehensive dataset enabled us to evaluate\\nthe impact of cooperative rainfall insurance on a wide range of socioeconomic outcomes, including\\nincome stability, food security, and social cohesion.\\nTo analyze the effectiveness of our experimental interventions, we employed a combination of\\nstatistical models and machine learning algorithms. These tools allowed us to identify patterns\\nand correlations within the data, as well as to predict the likelihood of certain outcomes based on\\na set of input variables. The results of these analyses were then used to refine the design of the\\ninsurance policies and to inform the development of supportive programs and services. For instance,\\nwe discovered that participants who received training on climate-resilient agriculture were more\\nlikely to adopt these practices and, consequently, experienced fewer crop failures and higher incomes.\\n6In an effort to further enhance the validity and reliability of our findings, we also conducted a series\\nof focus groups and community workshops. These interactive sessions provided a platform for\\nparticipants to share their experiences, raise concerns, and suggest improvements to the insurance\\nprogram. The feedback gathered through these events was invaluable, as it highlighted the importance\\nof community involvement, transparency, and accountability in the design and implementation\\nof cooperative rainfall insurance initiatives. By integrating the perspectives and needs of local\\nstakeholders, we were able to create a more inclusive and responsive framework for managing\\nclimate-related risks.\\nThe experimental framework also included a component focused on the development of innovative\\ntechnologies and tools to support the implementation of cooperative rainfall insurance. We collabo-\\nrated with a team of software developers to design a mobile application that enabled participants to\\naccess information on weather forecasts, agricultural practices, and insurance policy details. This\\napplication also included a feature for reporting crop losses and submitting claims, which streamlined\\nthe process and reduced the administrative burden on both participants and program administrators.\\nFurthermore, we explored the use of satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies to monitor\\ncrop health and detect early signs of stress, allowing for more timely and targeted interventions.\\nTo assess the financial viability of the cooperative rainfall insurance program, we conducted a detailed\\ncost-benefit analysis. This involved estimating the costs associated with program administration, pre-\\nmium collection, and payout disbursement, as well as the benefits accruing to participants in the form\\nof reduced risk, increased incomes, and improved livelihoods. The results of this analysis indicated\\nthat the program was financially sustainable, with the benefits exceeding the costs by a significant\\nmargin. However, we also identified areas for improvement, such as reducing administrative costs\\nand enhancing the efficiency of payout disbursement. By addressing these challenges, we can further\\nenhance the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance and ensure its long-term viability.\\nIn addition to the quantitative aspects of the experiment, we also explored the qualitative dimensions\\nof cooperative rainfall insurance. Through a series of case studies and ethnographic analyses, we\\nexamined the social and cultural contexts in which the insurance program was implemented. This\\ninvolved investigating the role of social networks, community norms, and cultural values in shaping\\nthe adoption and effectiveness of the program. The findings from these studies highlighted the\\nimportance of considering the local context and adapting the program design to meet the specific\\nneeds and preferences of different communities. By doing so, we can create a more nuanced and\\nresponsive approach to cooperative rainfall insurance, one that acknowledges the diversity and\\ncomplexity of human experiences.\\nThe experiment also incorporated a unique approach to evaluating the environmental impact of\\ncooperative rainfall insurance. We used a set of ecological indicators, such as soil erosion rates\\nand biodiversity indices, to assess the effects of the program on environmental sustainability. The\\nresults showed that participants who adopted climate-resilient agricultural practices experienced\\nsignificant reductions in soil erosion and improvements in biodiversity, compared to those who did\\nnot participate in the program. These findings suggest that cooperative rainfall insurance can have\\npositive environmental externalities, contributing to the conservation of natural resources and the\\npromotion of sustainable agriculture.\\nOverall, the experimental framework provided a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to\\ninvestigating the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance. By integrating qualitative\\nand quantitative methodologies, incorporating innovative technologies and tools, and considering\\nthe environmental and social contexts of program implementation, we were able to gain a deeper\\nunderstanding of the complex relationships between climate risk, agricultural practices, and livelihood\\noutcomes. The findings from this study have important implications for the design and implementation\\nof cooperative rainfall insurance programs, highlighting the need for a nuanced and adaptive approach\\nthat acknowledges the diversity and complexity of human experiences.\\nThe table above summarizes the experimental design and outcomes, highlighting the different\\ntreatment groups, insurance policies, and outcome measures. The results of the experiment showed\\nthat participants in the high-risk group, who received the comprehensive policy, experienced the most\\nsignificant improvements in income, crop yield, food security, and social cohesion. Additionally, this\\ngroup demonstrated the highest levels of environmental sustainability, as measured by soil erosion\\nrates and biodiversity indices. These findings suggest that cooperative rainfall insurance can have a\\npositive impact on both socioeconomic and environmental outcomes, particularly when designed and\\n7Table 1: Summary of Experimental Design and Outcomes\\nTreatment Group Insurance Policy Premium Rate Payout Structure Enrollment Requirements\\nControl No insurance - - -\\nLow-risk Basic policy 5% Fixed payout None\\nMedium-risk Standard policy 10% Variable payout Credit score\\nHigh-risk Comprehensive policy 15% Indexed payout Asset verification\\nimplemented in a way that acknowledges the complex relationships between climate risk, agricultural\\npractices, and livelihoods.\\n5 Results\\nThe analysis of the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance revealed a complex web\\nof interactions between the insured farmers, the insurance providers, and the local communities. Our\\nresearch uncovered that the implementation of cooperative rainfall insurance led to a significant\\nreduction in poverty rates among farming households, with an average decrease of 23.5\\nOne of the most striking findings was the correlation between the level of rainfall insurance coverage\\nand the level of community cohesion. Our data showed that villages with higher levels of insurance\\ncoverage also had higher levels of community engagement, with 75\\nHowever, our research also revealed some unexpected outcomes. For example, we found that the\\nintroduction of cooperative rainfall insurance led to a significant increase in the number of villagers\\nwho reported seeing UFOs. This phenomenon, which we termed \"Rainfall Insurance-Induced UFO\\nSightings\" (RIUFS), was observed in 42\\nTo further investigate the effects of cooperative rainfall insurance, we conducted a series of surveys\\nand interviews with villagers. The results of these surveys are presented in the following table:\\nTable 2: Socioeconomic Outcomes of Cooperative Rainfall Insurance\\nVillage Insurance Coverage Poverty Rate Community Cohesion UFO Sightings Crop Yields\\nVillage 1 80% 20% 90% 50% 25% increase\\nVillage 2 60% 30% 80% 30% 15% increase\\nVillage 3 40% 40% 60% 20% 5% increase\\nVillage 4 90% 15% 95% 60% 35% increase\\nVillage 5 50% 35% 70% 40% 10% increase\\nAs can be seen from the table, there is a clear correlation between the level of insurance coverage and\\nthe socioeconomic outcomes. Villages with higher levels of insurance coverage tend to have lower\\npoverty rates, higher levels of community cohesion, and higher crop yields. However, the relationship\\nbetween insurance coverage and UFO sightings is less clear, and further research is needed to fully\\nunderstand this phenomenon.\\nIn addition to the surveys and interviews, we also conducted a series of focus groups with villagers\\nto gather more detailed information about their experiences with cooperative rainfall insurance.\\nThe focus groups revealed that many villagers were initially skeptical about the insurance program,\\nbut eventually came to see it as a valuable tool for managing risk and improving their livelihoods.\\nHowever, some villagers also reported feeling anxious or stressed about the potential for drought or\\nexcessive rainfall, and the impact that this could have on their crops and livelihoods.\\nTo address these concerns, we developed a new approach that we termed \"Mindful Farming.\" This\\napproach involves teaching farmers mindfulness techniques, such as meditation and deep breathing,\\nto help them manage stress and anxiety. We also provided farmers with access to a mobile app that\\nallows them to track rainfall patterns and receive alerts when heavy rainfall is predicted. The results\\nof this approach were striking, with 90\\nOverall, our research suggests that cooperative rainfall insurance can have a significant impact on the\\nsocioeconomic well-being of farming communities. However, the relationship between insurance\\n8coverage and socioeconomic outcomes is complex, and further research is needed to fully understand\\nthe mechanisms at play. Additionally, the phenomenon of RIUFS remains a mystery, and further\\ninvestigation is needed to determine its causes and consequences.

By providing\\nfinancial protection against rainfall-related risks, cooperative rainfall insurance can help mitigate\\nthe adverse effects of droughts, floods, and other extreme weather events, thereby enhancing food\\nsecurity and reducing poverty.\\nMoreover, the cooperative aspect of this insurance model fosters a sense of community and social\\ncohesion, as participants work together to manage risks and share resources. This collective approach\\ncan lead to the development of more resilient and adaptable communities, better equipped to cope\\nwith the challenges posed by climate change. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the success of\\ncooperative rainfall insurance depends on various factors, including the effectiveness of the insurance\\nscheme, the level of participation, and the availability of resources.\\nIn a bizarre twist, some researchers have suggested that cooperative rainfall insurance could be used\\nas a tool for promoting inter-species cooperation and even communication with plants. According\\nto this theory, the insurance scheme could be designed to provide incentives for farmers to adopt\\npractices that promote soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, which in turn could lead to\\nmore harmonious relationships between humans and plants. While this approach may seem illogical\\nat first glance, it highlights the potential for cooperative rainfall insurance to have far-reaching and\\nunexpected consequences that transcend traditional socioeconomic boundaries.\\nThe potential applications of cooperative rainfall insurance are vast and varied, ranging from small-\\nscale agricultural projects to large-scale industrial operations. In the context of sustainable develop-\\nment, this type of insurance could play a vital role in promoting environmentally friendly practices,\\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions, and conserving natural resources. Furthermore, the coopera-\\ntive model could be replicated in other sectors, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure\\ndevelopment, to create more equitable and resilient systems.\\nA critical examination of the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance reveals a\\ncomplex web of relationships between economic, social, and environmental factors. It is essential to\\nconsider the long-term consequences of such insurance schemes, including their potential to create\\nnew forms of dependency, exacerbate existing social inequalities, or disrupt traditional ways of\\nlife. Nevertheless, the benefits of cooperative rainfall insurance, including its potential to reduce\\npoverty, promote social cohesion, and enhance environmental sustainability, make it an attractive\\noption for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers seeking innovative solutions to pressing global\\nchallenges.\\nUltimately, the socioeconomic impact of cooperative rainfall insurance will depend on the specific\\ncontext in which it is implemented, including the cultural, economic, and environmental characteristics\\nof the region. As such, it is crucial to adopt a nuanced and adaptive approach, one that takes into\\naccount the diverse needs and perspectives of various stakeholders, including farmers, communities,\\ngovernments, and the private sector. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of cooperative\\n10rainfall insurance to create a more just, equitable, and sustainable world, where the risks and benefits\\nof climate change are shared fairly and responsibly.\\nThe importance of continued research and development in this area cannot be overstated, as it has the\\npotential to revolutionize the way we approach risk management, social protection, and environmental\\nconservation. By exploring new frontiers in cooperative rainfall insurance, we may uncover novel\\nsolutions to some of the most pressing challenges of our time, from climate change and food insecurity\\nto social inequality and economic instability. As we move forward, it is essential to maintain a critical\\nand open-minded perspective, one that acknowledges the complexities and uncertainties of this\\nemerging field, while embracing its transformative potential to create a better future for all.\\nIn addition to its practical applications, cooperative rainfall insurance also raises fundamental ques-\\ntions about the nature of risk, responsibility, and cooperation in the face of uncertainty.

       "  'file_content': 'Analyzing Groups of Neurons in Neural Networks: Comparing\\nInformation from Input and Output Perspectives\\nAbstract\\nThe concept of a \"modular\" structure in artificial neural networks has been suggested as beneficial for learning,\\nthe ability to combine elements, and applying knowledge to new situations. However, a clear definition and\\nmeasurement of modularity are still open questions. This paper reframes the identification of functional modules as\\nthe identification of groups of units with similar functions. This raises the question of what constitutes functional\\nsimilarity between two units. To address this, we examine two main categories of methods: those that define\\nsimilarity based on how units react to variations in inputs (upstream), and those that define similarity based on\\nhow changes in hidden unit activations affect outputs (downstream). We perform an empirical analysis to measure\\nthe modularity of hidden layer representations in simple feedforward, fully connected networks across various\\nsettings. For each model, we assess the relationships between pairs of hidden units in each layer using a range\\nof upstream and downstream metrics, then group them by maximizing their \"modularity score\" with established\\nnetwork science tools. We find two unexpected results: first, dropout significantly increased modularity, while\\nother forms of weight regularization had smaller effects. Second, while we observe general agreement on clusters\\nwithin upstream methods and within downstream methods, there is limited agreement on cluster assignments\\nbetween these two categories. This has significant implications for representation learning, as it implies that\\nfinding modular representations that reflect input structure (e.g., disentanglement) may be a different objective\\nfrom learning modular representations that reflect output structure (e.g., compositionality).\\n1 Introduction\\nModularity, a principle where complex systems are broken down into simpler subsystems, allows for independent analysis, debugging,\\nand recombination for new tasks. This design approach offers benefits like enhanced robustness and quicker adaptation to new\\nchallenges. It is recognized that learning systems gain advantages from structures tailored to the specific problem, and many\\nreal-world problems can indeed be divided into sub-problems. Consequently, modularity is viewed as a standard design principle in\\nevolved biological systems, including biological neural networks, and one that can be advantageous for artificial neural networks\\n(ANNs).\\nDespite the intuitive appeal, formally defining and quantifying the modularity of a given system remains an unresolved issue. It is\\ngenerally agreed that modular systems, by definition, break down into subsystems that carry out functions to solve sub-problems.\\nDefining modules in ANNs, therefore, requires us to determine when two parts of a network are involved in the same \"function\". In\\nthis paper, we address this question at the level of pairs of hidden units. We explore various methods for assessing the \"functional\\nsimilarity\" of any two hidden units, and we define a \"module\" as a group of units with similar functions. This definition is not\\nintended to be the definitive answer to what constitutes a module, but rather to offer a practical foundation for experimenting with\\ndifferent concepts related to modularity, such as how regularization affects it.\\nA key objective of this paper is to highlight the differences between \"upstream\" and \"downstream\" perspectives when considering\\nneural representations and their functions. In Section 3, we provide precise definitions and detail our method for identifying and\\nquantifying functional modules in the hidden layers of trained neural networks by grouping units into functionally similar sets. This\\nframework enables us to directly compare various indicators of a network’s modularity. Section 4 describes the experimental results.\\nBesides quantitatively evaluating modularity, we further examine whether different similarity measures agree on the assignment of\\nunits to modules. Surprisingly, we find that modules identified using \"upstream\" measures of functional similarity are consistently\\ndifferent from those found using \"downstream\" measures. Although we do not examine regularization methods specifically designed\\nto create modular designs, these initial findings call for a more in-depth examination of how the \"function\" of a representation is\\ndefined, as well as why and when modules might be beneficial.2 Related Work\\nThe investigation of modularity in neural networks has a rich history. A frequent source of inspiration from biology is the separation\\nof \"what\" and \"where\" pathways in the ventral and dorsal streams of the brain, respectively. Each pathway can be viewed as a\\nspecialized module (and can be further divided into submodules). Numerous prior experiments on modularity in artificial neural\\nnetworks have investigated principles that would lead to similarly distinct what/where information processing in ANNs. A significant\\ndistinction from this line of work is that, instead of predefining the functional role of modules, such as one module handling \"what\"\\nand another handling \"where,\" our research aims to discover distinct functional groups in trained networks.\\nGenerally, there are two categories of approaches to modularity in neural networks, each corresponding to a different way of\\nunderstanding the function of network components. The structural modularity approach defines function based on network weights\\nand the connections between sub-networks. Modules are thus defined as sub-networks with dense internal connections and sparse\\nexternal connections. The functional modularity approach focuses on network activations or the information represented by those\\nactivations, rather than weights. This includes concepts like disentanglement, compositionality, and invariance. The connection\\nbetween structural and functional modules is not entirely clear. While they seem to be (or should be) correlated, it has been observed\\nthat even very sparse inter-module connectivity does not always ensure functional separation of information processing. In this study,\\nwe adopt the functional approach, assuming that structural modularity is only useful to the extent that it supports distinct functions\\nof the units, and that often distinct functions must share information, making strict structural boundaries potentially detrimental. For\\ninstance, in a complex visual scene, knowing \"what\" an object is can aid in determining \"where\" it is, and vice versa.\\nOur work is most closely related to a series of papers by Watanabe and colleagues in which trained networks are decomposed into\\nclusters of \"similar\" units with the aim of understanding and simplifying those networks. They quantify the similarity of units using\\na combination of both incoming and outgoing weights. This is similar in spirit to our goal of identifying modules by clustering units,\\nbut an interesting contrast to our approach, where we find stark differences between \"upstream\" and \"downstream\" similarity.\\n3 Quantifying modularity by clustering similarity\\nWe divide the task of identifying functional modules into two phases: evaluating the pairwise similarity of units, and then clustering\\nbased on this similarity. For simplicity, we apply these steps separately to each hidden layer, although in principle, modules could be\\nassessed in the same way after combining layers. Section 3.1 defines the set of pairwise functional similarity methods we use, and\\nSection 3.2 describes the clustering phase.\\nWhile we concentrate on similarity between pairs of individual units, our method is connected to, and inspired by, the question of\\nwhat makes neural representations \"similar\" when comparing entire populations of neurons to each other. Instead of finding clusters\\nof similar neurons as we do here, one could define modules in terms of dissimilarity between clusters of neurons. In preliminary\\nwork, we explored such a definition of functional modules, using representational (dis)similarity between sub-populations of neurons.\\nThe primary challenge with this approach is that existing representational similarity methods are highly sensitive to dimensionality\\n(the number of neurons in each cluster), and it is not clear how best to account for this when calculating dissimilarity between clusters\\nso that the method is not biased towards larger or smaller cluster sizes. To further justify our method, note that representational\\nsimilarity analysis is closely related to tests for statistical (in)dependence between populations of neurons, and so the problem of\\nfinding mutually \"dissimilar\" modules is analogous to the problem of finding independent subspaces. In Independent Subspace\\nAnalysis (ISA), there is a similar issue of determining what constitutes a surprising amount of dependence between subspaces of\\ndifferent dimensions, and various methods have been proposed with different inductive biases. However, Palmer Makeig showed\\nthat a solution to the problem of detecting independent subspaces is to simply cluster the individual dimensions of the space. This\\nprovides some justification for the methods we use here: some technicalities notwithstanding, the problem of finding subspaces of\\nneural activity with \"dissimilar\" representations is, in many cases, reducible to the problem of clustering individual units based on\\npairwise similarity, as we do here.\\n3.1 Quantifying pairwise similarity of hidden units\\nWhat constitutes \"functional similarity\" between two hidden units? In other words, we are looking for a similarity function S that\\ntakes a neural network N, a dataset D, and a task T as inputs, and produces an n x n matrix of non-negative similarity scores for all\\npairs among the n hidden units. We also require that the resulting matrix is symmetric, meaning Sij = Sji. Importantly, allowing S to\\ndepend on the task T opens up the possibility of similarity measures where units are considered similar based on their downstream\\ncontribution to a specific loss function.\\nSimilarity by covariance. The first similarity measure we examine is the absolute value of the covariance of hidden unit activities\\nacross inputs. Let xk be the kth input in the dataset, and hi(x) be the response of the ith hidden unit to input x, with i in 1, 2, ..., n.\\nThen, we define similarity as\\nScov\\nij = 1\\nK\\nKX\\nk=1\\n|(hi(xk) − ¯hi)(hj(xk) − ¯hj)| (1)\\n2where K is the number of items in D and ¯hi is the mean response of unit i on the given dataset. Intuitively, the absolute value\\ncovariance quantifies the statistical dependence of two units across inputs, making it an upstream measure of similarity.\\nSimilarity by input sensitivity. While Scov measures similarity of responses across inputs, we next consider a measure of similar\\nsensitivity to single inputs, which is then averaged over D. Let Jh\\nxk denote the n x d Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of each\\nhidden unit with respect to each of the d input dimensions. Then, we say two units i and j are similarly sensitive to input changes on\\ninput xk if the dot product between the ith and jth row of Jh\\nxk has high absolute-value magnitude. In matrix notation over the entire\\ndataset, we use\\nSi−sens\\nij = 1\\nK\\nKX\\nk=1\\n|Jh\\nxk (Jh\\nxk )T | (2)\\nwhere the superscript \"i-sens\" should be read as the \"input sensitivity.\"\\nSimilarity by last-layer sensitivity. Let y denote the last-layer activity of the network. Using the same Jacobian notation as above, let\\nJy\\nh denote the o x n matrix of partial derivatives of the last layer with respect to changes in the hidden activities h. Then, we define\\nsimilarity by output sensitivity as\\nSo−sens\\nij = 1\\nK\\nKX\\nk=1\\n|Jy\\nh(Jy\\nh)T | (3)\\nlikewise with \"o-sens\" to be read as \"output-sensitivity.\" Note that both h and y depend on the particular input xk, but this has been\\nleft implicit in the notation to reduce clutter.\\nSimilarity by the loss Hessian. The \"function\" of a hidden unit might usefully be thought of in terms of its contribution to the task or\\ntasks it was trained on. To quote Lipson, \"In order to measure modularity, one must have a quantitative definition of function... It is\\nthen possible to take an arbitrary chunk of a system and measure the dependency of the system function on elements within that\\nchunk. The more that the dependency itself depends on elements outside the chunk, the less the function of that chunk is localized,\\nand hence the less modular it is.\"\\nLipson then goes on to suggest that the \"dependence of system function on elements\" can be expressed as a derivative or gradient,\\nand that the dependence of that dependence on other parts of the system can be expressed as the second derivative or Hessian.\\nTowards this conception of modular functions on a particular task, we use the following definition of similarity:\\nShess\\nij = 1\\nK\\nKX\\nk=1\\n| ∂2L\\n∂hi∂hj\\n| (4)\\nwhere L is the scalar loss function for the task, and should be understood to depend on the particular input xk. Importantly, each\\nHessian on the right hand side is taken with respect to the activity of hidden units, not with respect to the network parameters as it is\\ntypically defined.\\nTo summarize, equations (1) through (4) provide four different methods to quantify pairwise similarity of hidden units.Scov and\\nSi−sens are upstream, while So−sens and Shess are downstream. All four take values in [0, ). However, it is not clear if the raw\\nmagnitudes matter, or only relative (normalized) magnitudes. For these reasons, we introduce an optional normalized version of\\neach of the above four un-normalized similarity measures:\\nS′\\nij = Sij\\nmax(Sii, Sjj , ϵ) (5)\\nwhere ˘20ac is a small positive value included for numerical stability. Whereas Sij is in [0, ), the normalized values are restricted\\nto S′\\nij in [0,1]. In total, this gives us eight methods to quantify pairwise similarity. These can be thought of as 2x2x2 product of\\nmethods, as shown in the color scheme in Figure 2: the upstream vs downstream axis, the unnormalized vs normalized axis, and\\nthe covariance vs gradient (i.e. sensitivity) axis. We group together both Scov and Shess under the term \"covariance\" because the\\nHessian is closely related to the covariance of gradient vectors of the loss across inputs.\\n3.2 Quantifying modularity by clustering\\nDecomposing a set into clusters that are maximally similar within clusters and maximally dissimilar across clusters is a well-studied\\nproblem in graph theory and network science. In particular, Girvan Newman proposed a method that cuts a graph into its maximally\\nmodular subgraphs, and this tool has previously been used to study modular neural networks.\\n3We apply this tool from graph theory to our problem of detecting functional modules in neural networks by constructing an adjacency\\nmatrix A from the similarity matrix S by simply removing the diagonal (self-similarity):\\nAij =\\n\\x1aSij if i̸= j\\n0 otherwise (6)\\nGiven A, we can simplify later notation by first constructing the normalized adjacency matrix, ˜A, whose elements all sum to one:\\n˜Aij = AijP\\nij Aij\\n(7)\\nor, more compactly, ˜A = A/1T\\nn A1n where 1n is a column vector of length n containing all ones. Let P be an n x c matrix that\\nrepresents cluster assignments for each of n units to a maximum of c different clusters. Cluster assignments can be \"hard\" (Pij in 0,\\n1) or \"soft\" (Pij in [0, 1]), but in either case the constraint P1c = 1n must be met, i.e. that the sum of cluster assignments for each\\nunit is 1. If an entire column of P is zero, that cluster is unused, so c only provides an upper-limit to the number of clusters, and in\\npractice we set c = n. Girvan Newman propose the following score to quantify the level of \"modularity\" when partitioning the\\nnormalized adjacency matrix ˜A into the cluster assignments P:\\nQ( ˜A, P) = T r(PT ˜AP) − T r(PT ˜A1n1T\\nn ˜AP) (8)\\nThe first term sums the total connectivity (or, in our case, similarity) of units that share a cluster. By itself, this term is maximized\\nwhen P assigns all units to a single cluster. The second term gives the expected connectivity within each cluster under a null\\nmodel where the elements of ˜A are interpreted as the joint probability of a connection, and so ˜A1n1T\\nn ˜A is the product of marginal\\nprobabilities of each unit’s connections. This second term encourages P to place units into the same cluster only if they are\\nmore similar to each other than \"chance.\" Together, equation (8) is maximized by partitioning ˜A into clusters that are strongly\\nintra-connected and weakly inter-connected.\\nWe define the modularity of a set of neural network units as the maximum achievable Q over all P:\\nP∗( ˜A) = argmaxP Q( ˜A, P)Q∗( ˜A) = Q( ˜A, P∗) (9)\\nTo summarize, to divide a given pairwise similarity matrix S into modules, we first construct ˜A from S, then we find the cluster\\nassignments P∗ that give the maximal value Q∗. Importantly, this optimization process provides two pieces of information: a\\nmodularity score Q∗ which quantifies the amount of modularity in a set of neurons, for a given similarity measure. We also get\\nthe actual cluster assignments P∗, which provide additional information and can be compared across different similarity measures.\\nGiven a set of cluster assignments P∗, we quantify the number of clusters by first getting the fraction of units in each cluster,\\nr(P∗) = 1T\\nn P∗/n. We then use the formula for discrete entropy to measure the dispersion of cluster sizes: H(r) = −Pc\\ni=1 rilogri.\\nFinally we say that the number of clusters in P∗ is\\nnumclusters(P∗) = eH(r(P∗)) (10)\\nWe emphasize that discovering the number of clusters in P∗ is included automatically in the optimization process; we set the\\nmaximum number of clusters c equal to the number of hidden units n, but in our experiments we find thatP∗ rarely uses more than 6\\nclusters for hidden layers with 64 units (Supplemental Figure S4).\\nIt is important to recognize that the sense of the word \"modularity\" in graph theory is in some important ways distinct from its\\nmeaning in terms of engineering functionally modular systems. In graph-theoretic terms, a \"module\" is a cluster of nodes that are\\nhighly intra-connected and weakly inter-connected to other parts of the network, defined formally by Q. This definition of graph\\nmodularity uses a particular idea of a \"null model\" based on random connectivity between nodes in a graph. While this null-model\\nof graph connectivity enjoys a good deal of historical precedence in the theory of randomly-connected graphs, where unweighted\\ngraphs are commonly studied in terms of the probability of connection between random pairs of nodes, it is not obvious that the\\nsame sort of null model applies to groups of \"functionally similar\" units in an ANN. This relates to the earlier discussion of ISA, and\\nprovides a possibly unsatisfying answer to the question of what counts as a \"surprising\" amount of statistical independence between\\nclusters; using Q makes the implicit choice that the product of average pairwise similarity, ˜A1n1T\\nn ˜A, gives the \"expected\" similarity\\nbetween units. An important problem for future work will be to closely reexamine the question of what makes neural populations\\nfunctionally similar or dissimilar, above and beyond statistical similarity, and what constitutes a surprising amount of (dis)similarity\\nthat may be indicative of modular design.\\nFinding P∗ exactly is NP-complete, so in practice we use a variation on the approximate method proposed by Newman. Briefly, the\\napproximation works in two steps: first, an initial set of cluster assignments is constructed using a fast spectral initialization method\\nthat, similar to other spectral clustering algorithms, recursively divides units into clusters based on the sign of eigenvectors of the\\n4matrix B = ˜A − ˜A1n1T\\nn ˜A and its submatrices. Only subdivisions that increase Q are kept. In the second step, we use a Monte Carlo\\nmethod that repeatedly selects a random unit i then resamples its cluster assignment, holding the other n-1 assignments fixed. This\\nresampling step involves a kind of exploration/exploitation trade-off: Q may decrease slightly on each move to potentially find a\\nbetter global optimum. We found that it was beneficial to control the entropy of each step using a temperature parameter, to ensure\\nthat a good explore/exploit balance was struck for all ˜A. Supplemental Figure S2 shows that both the initialization and the Monte\\nCarlo steps play a crucial role in finding P∗, consistent with the observations of Newman. Full algorithms are given in Appendix\\nA.1.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Setup and initial hypotheses\\nBecause our primary goal is to understand the behavior of the various notions of modularity above, i.e. based on the eight different\\nmethods for quantifying pairwise similarity introduced in the previous section, we opted to study a large collection of simple networks\\ntrained on MNIST. All pairwise similarity scores were computed using held-out test data. We trained 270 models, comprising 9 runs\\nof each of 30 regularization settings, summarized in Table 1. We defined x (input layer) as the raw 784-dimensional pixel inputs and\\ny (output layer) as the 10-dimensional class logits. We used the same basic feedforward architecture for all models, comprising\\ntwo layers of hidden activity connected by three layers of fully-connected weights: Linear(784, 64), ReLU, dropout(p), Linear(64,\\n64), ReLU, dropout(p), Linear(64, 10). We analyzed modularity in the two 64-dimensional hidden layers following the dropout\\noperations. We discarded 21 models that achieved less than 80\\nBefore running these experiments, we hypothesized that\\n1. Dropout would decrease modularity by encouraging functions to be \"spread out\" over many units. 2. L2 regularization (weight\\ndecay) would minimally impact modularity since the L2 norm is invariant to rotation while modularity depends on axis-alignment. 3.\\nL1 regularization on weights would increase modularity by encouraging sparsity between subnetworks. 4. All similarity measures\\nwould be qualitatively consistent with each other.\\nAs shown below, all four of these hypotheses turned out to be wrong, to varying degrees.\\n4.2 How modularity depends on regularization\\nFigure 3 shows the dependence of trained networks’ modularity score (Q∗) as a function of regularization strength for each of three\\ntypes of regularization: an L2 penalty on the weights (weight decay), an L1 penalty on the weights, and dropout. The top row of\\nFigure 3 shows four example ˜A matrices sorted by cluster, to help give an intuition behind the quantitative values ofQ∗. In these\\nexamples, the increasing value of Q∗ is driven by an increasing contrast between intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster similarity.\\nIn this example, it also appears that the number and size of clusters remains roughly constant; this observation is confirmed by\\nplotting the number of clusters versus regularization strength in Supplemental Figure S4.\\nFigure 3 shows a number of surprising patterns that contradict our initial predictions. First, and most saliently, we had predicted that\\ndropout would reduce modularity, but found instead that it has the greatest effect on Q∗ among the three regularization methods we\\ntried. This is especially apparent in the upstream methods (first two columns of the figure), and is also stronger for the first hidden\\nlayer than the second (Supplemental Figure S3). In general, Q∗ can increase either if the network partitions into a greater number of\\nclusters, or if the contrast between clusters is exaggerated. We found that this dramatic effect of dropout on Q∗ was accompanied\\nby only minor changes to the number of clusters (Supplemental Figure S4), and so we can conclude that dropout increases Q∗ by\\nincreasing the redundancy of hidden units. In other words, hidden units become more clusterable because they are driven towards\\nbehaving like functional replicas of each other, separately for each cluster. This observation echoes, and may explain, why dropout\\nalso increases the \"clusterability\" of network weights in a separate study.\\nThe second surprising result in Figure 3 is that L2 regularization on the weights did, in fact, increase Q∗, whereas we had expected it\\nto have no impact. Third, L1 regularization had a surprisingly weak effect, although its similarity to the L2 regularization results\\nmay be explained by the fact that they actually resulted in fairly commensurate sparsity in the trained weights (Supplemental Figure\\nS1 bottom row). Fourth, we had expected few differences between the eight different methods for computing similarity, but there\\nappear to be distinctive trends by similarity type both in Figure S3 as well as in the number of clusters detected (Supplemental\\nFigure S4). The next section explores the question of similarity in the results in more detail.\\n4.3 Comparing modules discovered by different similarity methods\\nThe previous section discussed idiosyncratic trends in the modularity scores Q∗ as a function of both regularization strength and\\nhow pairwise similarity between units (S) is computed. However, such differences in the quantitative value ofQ∗ are difficult to\\ninterpret, and would largely be moot if the various methods agreed on the question of which units belong in which cluster. We now\\nturn to the question of how similar the cluster assignments P∗ are across our eight definitions of functional modules. To minimize\\nambiguity, we will use the term \"functional-similarity\" to refer to S, and \"cluster-similarity\" to refer to the comparison of different\\ncluster assignments P∗.\\n5Quantifying similarity between cluster assignments is a well-studied problem, and we tested a variety of methods in the clusim\\nPython package. All cluster-similarity methods we investigated gave qualitatively similar results, so here we report only the \"Element\\nSimilarity\" method of Gates et al., which is a value between 0 and 1 that is small when two cluster assignments are unrelated, and\\nlarge when one cluster assignment is highly predictive of the other. Note that this cluster-similarity analysis is applied only toP∗\\ncluster assignments computed in the same layer of the same model. Thus, any dissimilarity in clusters that we see is due entirely to\\nthe different choices for functional-similarity, S.\\nFigure 4a summarizes the results of this cluster-similarity analysis: there is a striking difference between clusters of units identified by\\n\"upstream\" functional-similarity methods (Scov, ˜Scov, Si−sens, ˜Si−sens) compared to \"downstream\" functional-similarity methods\\n(Shess, ˜Shess, So−sens, ˜So−sens). This analysis also reveals secondary structure within each class of upstream and downstream\\nmethods, where the choice to normalize not (S vs ˜S) appears to matter little, and where there is a moderate difference between\\nmoment-based methods (Scov, Shess) and gradient-based methods (Si−sens, So−sens). It is worth noting that some of this secondary\\nstructure is not robust across all types and levels of regularization; in particular, increasing L2 or L1 regularization strength appears\\nto lead to (i) stronger dependence on normalization in the downstream methods, and (ii) a stronger overall agreement among the\\nupstream methods (Supplemental Figure S5).\\nWe next asked to what extent these cluster-similarity results are driven by training. As shown in Figure 4b, much of the structure\\nin the downstream methods is unaffected by training (i.e. it is present in untrained models as well), while the cluster-similarity\\namong different upstream methods only emerged as a result of training. Interestingly, this analysis further shows that the main\\nupstream-vs-downstream distinction seen in Figure 4a is, in fact, attenuated slightly by training.\\n5 Conclusions\\nThe prevalence of \"modular\" designs in both engineered and evolved systems has led many to consider the benefits of modularity as\\na design principle, and how learning agents like artificial neural networks might discover such designs. However, precisely defining\\nwhat constitutes a \"module\" within a neural network remains an open problem. In this work, we operationalized modules in a neural\\nnetwork as groups of hidden units that carry out similar functions. This naturally leads to the question of what makes any two units\\nfunctionally similar. We introduced eight functional similarity measures designed to capture various intuitions about unit similarity\\nand empirically evaluated cluster assignments based on each method in a large number of trained models.\\nOne unexpected observation was that dropout increases modularity (as defined by Q∗), although this has little to do with the\\ncommon-sense definition of a \"module.\" Instead, it is a byproduct of dropout causing subsets of units to behave like near-copies\\nof each other, perhaps so that if one unit is dropped out, a copy of it provides similar information to the subsequent layer. To our\\nknowledge, this redundancy-inducing effect of dropout has not been noted in the literature previously.\\nOur main result is that there is a crucial difference between defining \"function\" in terms of how units are driven by upstream inputs,\\nand how units drive downstream outputs. While we studied this distinction between upstream and downstream similarity in the\\ncontext of modularity and clustering, it speaks to the deeper and more general problem of how best to interpret neural representations.\\nFor example, some sub-disciplines of representation-learning (e.g. \"disentanglement\") have long emphasized that a \"good\" neural\\nrepresentation is one where distinct features of the world drive distinct sub-populations or sub-spaces of neural activity. This is an\\nupstream way of thinking about what is represented, since it depends only on the relationship between inputs and the unit activations\\nand does not take into account what happens downstream. Meanwhile, many have argued that the defining characteristic of a neural\\nrepresentation is its causal role in downstream behavior; this is, of course, a downstream way of thinking. At a high level, one way\\nto interpret our results is is that upstream and downstream ways of thinking about neural representations are not necessarily aligned,\\neven in trained networks. This observation is reminiscent of recent empirical work finding that \"disentangled\" representations in\\nauto-encoders (an upstream concept) do not necessarily lead to improved performance or generalization to novel tasks (a downstream\\nconcept).\\nDespite its theoretical motivations, this is an empirical study. We trained over 250 feedforward, fully-connected neural networks on\\nMNIST. While it is not obvious whether MNIST admits a meaningful \"modular\" solution, we expect that the main results we show\\nhere are likely robust, in particular (i) the effect of weight decay, an L1 weight penalty, and dropout, and (ii) misalignment between\\nupstream and downstream definitions of neural similarity.\\nOur work raises the important questions: are neural representations defined by their inputs or their outputs? And, in what contexts\\nis it beneficial for these to be aligned? We look forward to future work applying our methods to larger networks trained on more\\nstructured data, as well as recurrent networks. We also believe it will be valuable to evaluate the effect of attempting to maximize\\nmodularity, as we have defined it, during training, to see to what extent this is possible and whether it leads to performance benefits.\\nNote that maximizing Q during training is challenging because (i) computing S may require large batches, and more importantly\\n(ii) optimizing Q is highly prone to local minima, since neural activity and cluster assignments P will tend to reinforce each other,\\nentrenching accidental clusters that appear at the beginning of training. We suspect that maintaining uncertainty over cluster\\nassignments (e.g. using soft Pij in [0, 1] rather than hard P in 0, 1 cluster assignments) will be crucial if optimizing any of our\\nproposed modularity metrics during training.\\n6References\\nMohammed Amer and Tomás Maul.

In these attacks, adversaries corrupt only the training labels, without modifying the\\ninput data (e.g., images), to surreptitiously implant backdoors into machine learning models. This\\ncontrasts with traditional backdoor attacks that require manipulating the input data itself, making label-\\nonly attacks a more subtle and potentially harder-to-detect threat. The ease with which an attacker can\\nmanipulate labels, especially in crowd-sourced annotation settings, makes this a significant concern\\nfor the security and trustworthiness of machine learning systems. The potential for widespread impact\\nnecessitates a thorough investigation into the vulnerabilities and defenses against such attacks. This\\nwork aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of this emerging threat landscape.\\nWe introduce FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison), a novel label-only backdoor attack mechanism\\ndesigned to exploit vulnerabilities in the training process. The core idea behind FLIP is to strategically\\nmanipulate a small subset of training labels, forcing the model to learn a hidden mapping between\\na specific trigger (e.g., a subtle alteration in the label distribution, or a specific pattern in the\\nlabels themselves) and a predetermined target output. This allows the attacker to control the model’s\\npredictions for inputs associated with the trigger, even if those inputs are otherwise correctly classified\\nby the model. The subtlety of the attack lies in its reliance on label manipulation alone, making it\\ndifficult to detect using traditional methods focused on input data anomalies. The effectiveness of this\\napproach hinges on the model’s ability to learn spurious correlations between seemingly innocuous\\nlabel patterns and the desired target output.\\nThe effectiveness of FLIP is evaluated across various scenarios, including those that mimic real-world\\ndata collection challenges. We explore the impact of noisy labels, often encountered in crowd-\\nsourced annotation settings, on the success rate of the attack. We investigate the robustness of FLIP\\nagainst different defense mechanisms, such as data augmentation and adversarial training, commonly\\nemployed to enhance model robustness. Our experiments systematically vary key attack parameters,\\nsuch as the number of poisoned labels and the strength of the trigger, to understand the trade-offs\\ninvolved. This allows us to characterize the attack’s effectiveness under different conditions and\\nto identify potential weaknesses that could be exploited for defense. The results provide valuable\\ninsights into the vulnerabilities of machine learning models to this type of attack.\\n.We analyze the trade-offs between Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA)\\nunder different attack parameters. This analysis reveals a complex relationship between the number\\nof poisoned labels, the strength of the trigger, and the overall performance of the model. We observe\\nthat while increasing the number of poisoned labels generally improves PTA, it can also lead to a\\nsignificant drop in CTA, indicating a trade-off between the effectiveness of the backdoor and the\\nmodel’s overall accuracy on clean data. This trade-off is crucial for attackers to consider when\\ndesigning their attacks, as they need to balance the effectiveness of the backdoor with the risk of\\ndetection. A careful analysis of this trade-off is essential for developing effective defense strategies.\\nThe efficiency of FLIP is another key aspect of our study. We demonstrate that FLIP requires\\nsignificantly fewer poisoned labels compared to traditional backdoor attacks that modify the input\\ndata. This makes FLIP a particularly attractive option for attackers who have limited access to the\\ntraining data or who wish to remain undetected. The reduced computational overhead associated\\nwith label manipulation also contributes to the efficiency of FLIP. This makes it a practical threat\\neven in resource-constrained environments, highlighting the need for robust defenses that can operate\\nefficiently as well. The low cost and high effectiveness of FLIP underscore the severity of the threat\\nit poses.\\nOur experiments further explore the applicability of FLIP in the context of knowledge distillation [3].\\nWe show that FLIP can effectively implant backdoors into student models trained using knowledge\\ndistillation from a clean teacher model. This highlights the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to\\nlabel-only backdoor attacks, suggesting that the distillation process itself may inadvertently transfer\\nthe backdoor from the teacher to the student model. This finding underscores the importance of\\nsecuring the training data and processes at every stage of model development, emphasizing the need\\nfor a holistic security approach. The implications for model training pipelines are significant and\\nwarrant further investigation.\\nThe implications of our findings are significant for the security and trustworthiness of machine\\nlearning systems. The ease with which label-only backdoors can be implanted, even under realistic\\nconditions, necessitates the development of new defense mechanisms specifically designed to detect\\nand mitigate these types of attacks. Future research should focus on developing robust methods for\\ndetecting subtle label manipulations and for designing training procedures that are less susceptible\\nto label-only backdoor attacks. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label consistency\\nchecks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods. The development of such defenses is\\ncrucial for mitigating the risks posed by FLIP and similar attacks.\\nFinally, our work contributes to a broader understanding of the vulnerabilities of machine learning\\nmodels to adversarial attacks. The ability to implant backdoors using only label manipulation\\nhighlights the importance of considering the entire training pipeline, including data collection,\\nannotation, and model training, when assessing the security of machine learning systems. This\\nholistic approach is crucial for developing more secure and trustworthy AI systems. Further research\\nis needed to explore the potential for extending FLIP to other machine learning tasks and model\\narchitectures, and to investigate the broader implications of label-only attacks on the trustworthiness\\nof AI. The findings presented here represent a significant step towards a more comprehensive\\nunderstanding of this emerging threat.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe field of adversarial attacks on machine learning models has seen significant growth in recent\\nyears, with a focus on various attack strategies and defense mechanisms. Early work primarily\\nconcentrated on input-based attacks, where adversaries manipulate the input data (e.g., images) to\\ncause misclassification [4, 5]. These attacks often involve adding carefully crafted perturbations to\\nthe input, making them difficult to detect. However, the reliance on input manipulation limits the\\nattacker’s reach, particularly in scenarios where direct access to the input data is restricted. Our\\nwork explores a different paradigm, focusing on label-only attacks, which offer a more subtle and\\npotentially harder-to-detect approach.\\nLabel-only attacks represent a relatively nascent area of research, with fewer studies dedicated to\\ntheir analysis and mitigation. Existing literature on data poisoning often focuses on manipulating\\nthe training data itself, including both features and labels [6, 7]. However, these approaches often\\nrequire a significant level of access to the training dataset, which may not always be feasible for an\\n2attacker. In contrast, label-only attacks leverage the inherent vulnerabilities in the label annotation\\nprocess, making them a more practical threat in real-world scenarios where data annotation is often\\noutsourced or crowd-sourced. The subtlety of these attacks makes them particularly challenging to\\ndetect and defend against.\\nSeveral studies have explored the impact of noisy labels on model training and performance [8, 9].\\nWhile these studies primarily focus on the effects of random label noise, they provide a foundation\\nfor understanding how label inconsistencies can affect model learning. Our work builds upon this\\nfoundation by investigating the impact of strategically injected label noise, specifically designed to\\nimplant backdoors. The strategic manipulation of labels, as opposed to random noise, allows for a\\nmore targeted and effective attack, highlighting the unique challenges posed by label-only backdoor\\nattacks.\\nThe concept of backdoor attacks has been extensively studied in the context of input data manipulation\\n[10, 11]. These attacks typically involve modifying a subset of the training data to trigger a specific\\nmisclassification. However, label-only backdoor attacks differ significantly in their approach, relying\\nsolely on label manipulation to achieve the same effect.

The subtlety of label manipulation makes detection significantly more challenging compared\\nto input-based attacks.\\nKnowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for training efficient student models\\nusing knowledge from larger teacher models [12, 13]. While knowledge distillation offers significant\\nbenefits in terms of model compression and efficiency, our work highlights its vulnerability to label-\\nonly backdoor attacks. The potential for backdoors to propagate from teacher to student models\\nunderscores the importance of securing the entire training pipeline, including the teacher model and\\nthe distillation process itself. This finding emphasizes the need for a holistic security approach that\\nconsiders all stages of model development.\\nOur work contributes to the broader literature on adversarial machine learning by exploring a novel\\nattack vector—label-only backdoors. This expands the understanding of vulnerabilities in machine\\nlearning systems beyond traditional input-based attacks. The findings presented in this paper highlight\\nthe need for a more comprehensive approach to security, considering not only the input data but\\nalso the entire training process, including data annotation and model training techniques. Future\\nresearch should focus on developing robust defenses against label-only attacks, considering the\\nunique challenges they pose. This includes exploring techniques that leverage label consistency\\nchecks, anomaly detection, and robust model training methods.\\n3 Background\\nLabel-only backdoor attacks represent a significant and emerging threat to the security and trustwor-\\nthiness of machine learning models. Unlike traditional backdoor attacks that involve manipulating\\ninput data, these attacks exploit vulnerabilities in the training process by corrupting only the training\\nlabels. This subtle manipulation can lead to the implantation of backdoors that are difficult to detect\\nusing conventional methods. The ease with which labels can be altered, particularly in crowd-sourced\\nannotation settings, makes this a particularly concerning vulnerability. The potential for widespread\\nimpact necessitates a thorough investigation into the vulnerabilities and defenses against such attacks.\\nThis research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of this emerging threat landscape and to\\ninform the development of robust countermeasures.

However, these approaches often require significant access to the training\\ndata, which may not always be feasible for an attacker. Label-only attacks offer a more practical\\nalternative, leveraging the inherent vulnerabilities in the label annotation process. The subtlety of\\nthese attacks makes them particularly challenging to detect and defend against, as they do not involve\\nreadily apparent modifications to the input data itself. This necessitates the development of novel\\ndefense mechanisms specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics of label-only attacks.\\nThe challenge lies in identifying subtle patterns in the label distribution that might indicate malicious\\nmanipulation.\\n3Several studies have explored the impact of noisy labels on model training and performance. These\\nstudies primarily focus on the effects of random label noise, providing a foundation for understanding\\nhow label inconsistencies can affect model learning. However, label-only backdoor attacks differ\\nsignificantly in that the label noise is strategically injected, rather than being random. This strategic\\nmanipulation allows for a more targeted and effective attack, resulting in the implantation of a\\nbackdoor that triggers specific misclassifications. The ability to control the nature and location of\\nthe label noise is crucial to the success of the attack. Understanding the interplay between the level\\nof noise, the strategic placement of poisoned labels, and the resulting model behavior is key to\\ndeveloping effective defenses.\\nThe concept of backdoor attacks has been extensively studied in the context of input data manipu-\\nlation. These attacks typically involve modifying a subset of the training data to trigger a specific\\nmisclassification when a particular trigger is present in the input. However, label-only backdoor\\nattacks differ significantly in their approach, relying solely on label manipulation to achieve the\\nsame effect. This distinction necessitates the development of novel defense mechanisms specifically\\ntailored to address the unique characteristics of label-only attacks. The subtlety of label manipulation\\nmakes detection significantly more challenging compared to input-based attacks, requiring more\\nsophisticated methods for identifying anomalous patterns in the label distribution.\\nKnowledge distillation is a powerful technique for training efficient student models using knowledge\\nfrom larger teacher models.

A balance must be struck\\nbetween security and accuracy, ensuring that the defenses do not unduly compromise the model’s\\nutility. The development of such defenses is crucial for mitigating the risks posed by label-only\\nbackdoor attacks and ensuring the trustworthiness of machine learning systems.\\n4 Methodology\\nThis section details the methodology employed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of label-\\nonly backdoor attacks using the FLIP (Flipping Labels to Inject Poison) mechanism. Our approach\\ninvolves a comprehensive evaluation across various scenarios, including those that mimic real-world\\ndata collection challenges and model training paradigms. The core of our methodology centers\\naround strategically manipulating a subset of training labels to induce a hidden mapping between a\\nspecific trigger (a pattern in the label sequence) and a predetermined target output. This manipulation\\nis designed to force the model to learn a spurious correlation, enabling backdoor control without\\nmodifying the input data itself.\\nThe effectiveness of FLIP is assessed across multiple datasets and model architectures. We systemat-\\nically vary key attack parameters, including the percentage of poisoned labels, the strength of the\\ntrigger (defined by the complexity and consistency of the label pattern), and the type of trigger used.\\nThe choice of datasets and models ensures generalizability and robustness of our findings. We employ\\nstandard evaluation metrics, including Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA),\\nto quantify the impact of the attack. CTA measures the model’s accuracy on clean, unpoisoned data,\\nwhile PTA measures the model’s accuracy on data associated with the trigger. The trade-off between\\nCTA and PTA is a crucial aspect of our analysis, providing insights into the attack’s effectiveness\\nversus its detectability.\\n4To simulate real-world scenarios, we introduce label noise into the training data. This noise is inde-\\npendent of the strategically injected poisoned labels, mimicking the imperfections often encountered\\nin crowd-sourced annotation settings. By varying the level of label noise, we assess the robustness of\\nFLIP against noisy labels. We hypothesize that even with a significant level of random label noise,\\nFLIP will remain effective due to the strategic nature of the poisoned labels. This analysis provides\\nvaluable insights into the attack’s resilience in less-than-ideal data conditions.\\nFurthermore, we investigate the robustness of FLIP against common defense mechanisms. Specifi-\\ncally, we evaluate the attack’s effectiveness against data augmentation techniques and adversarial\\ntraining. Data augmentation involves artificially expanding the training dataset by applying various\\ntransformations to the existing data. Adversarial training aims to improve model robustness by\\ntraining the model on adversarial examples, which are designed to fool the model. By testing FLIP\\nagainst these defenses, we assess its resilience to commonly employed security measures. This\\nanalysis helps to identify potential weaknesses in existing defenses and inform the development of\\nmore robust countermeasures.\\nThe efficiency of FLIP is evaluated by comparing the number of poisoned labels required for\\nsuccessful backdoor implantation with that of traditional input-based backdoor attacks. We expect\\nFLIP to require significantly fewer poisoned labels, making it a more efficient and stealthy attack.\\nThis efficiency is a key advantage of label-only attacks, as it reduces the attacker’s effort and risk of\\ndetection. The computational overhead associated with label manipulation is also significantly lower\\nthan that of input data modification, further enhancing the practicality of FLIP.\\nFinally, we explore the applicability of FLIP in the context of knowledge distillation. We train a\\nstudent model using knowledge distillation from a clean teacher model, where the teacher model’s\\ntraining data has been subjected to a FLIP attack. We investigate whether the backdoor is transferred\\nfrom the teacher to the student model during the distillation process. This analysis highlights the\\npotential for cascading vulnerabilities in model training pipelines and underscores the importance of\\nsecuring the training data and processes at every stage of model development. The results provide\\ninsights into the vulnerability of knowledge distillation to label-only backdoor attacks.\\nThe experimental setup involves a rigorous comparison across various datasets, model architectures,\\nand attack parameters.

We employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as our model architecture,\\nspecifically using variations of LeNet-5 for MNIST and VGG-like architectures for CIFAR-10 and\\n5Fashion-MNIST. The choice of datasets and models ensured generalizability and robustness of our\\nfindings. For each dataset, we varied the percentage of poisoned labels (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) and\\nthe strength of the trigger (defined by the complexity and consistency of the label pattern). The trigger\\nwas implemented as a specific sequence of labels within the training set. We used standard evaluation\\nmetrics, including Clean Test Accuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA), to quantify the\\nimpact of the attack.\\nTo simulate real-world scenarios with noisy labels, we introduced random label noise into the training\\ndata. The level of noise was varied (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%), and the noise was independent of\\nthe strategically injected poisoned labels. This allowed us to assess FLIP’s robustness against noisy\\nlabels, mimicking the imperfections often encountered in crowd-sourced annotation settings. We\\nobserved that even with a significant level of random label noise, FLIP remained remarkably effective,\\ndemonstrating its resilience in less-than-ideal data conditions.

We conducted experiments across three\\nbenchmark datasets: MNIST [14], CIFAR-10 [15], and Fashion-MNIST [16], using convolutional\\nneural networks (CNNs) of varying architectures. Our primary evaluation metrics were Clean Test\\nAccuracy (CTA) and Poison Test Accuracy (PTA), measuring the model’s performance on clean and\\npoisoned data, respectively. We systematically varied the percentage of poisoned labels (5%, 10%,\\n15%, and 20%), the strength of the trigger (a pattern in the label sequence), and the level of random\\nlabel noise (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) to assess FLIP’s robustness under diverse conditions. The\\nresults demonstrate a clear trade-off between CTA and PTA, highlighting the challenges in balancing\\nbackdoor effectiveness with the risk of detection.\\nOur findings consistently show that FLIP is highly effective in implanting backdoors, even with a\\nsignificant amount of random label noise. Table 4 presents the CTA and PTA for MNIST under\\nvarying noise levels. As expected, increasing the noise level reduces both CTA and PTA, but even at\\n30% noise, PTA remains significantly high, indicating the resilience of FLIP to label noise. Similar\\ntrends were observed for CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, demonstrating the generalizability of\\nFLIP’s effectiveness across different datasets. The strategic nature of the poisoned labels allows FLIP\\nto overcome the effects of random noise, making it a potent threat even in real-world scenarios with\\nimperfect label annotations.\\nTable 4: Impact of Label Noise on FLIP Effectiveness (MNIST)\\nNoise Level (%) CTA (%) PTA (%) Poisoned Labels (%)\\n0 97.2 ± 0.5 99.5 ± 0.2 10\\n10 96.5 ± 0.7 98.8 ± 0.4 10\\n20 95.1 ± 0.9 97.9 ± 0.6 10\\n30 93.8 ± 1.1 96.5 ± 0.8 10\\nWe further investigated FLIP’s robustness against common defense mechanisms, including data\\naugmentation and adversarial training.

       "  'file_content': 'Enhancing Urban Crop Cultivation Using\\nDrone-Based Swarm Strategies: A Sociobiological\\nApproach to Automated Pollination\\nAbstract\\nThis paper presents a groundbreaking exploration of the intersection between urban\\nfarming, insect-inspired swarm robotics, and sociobiology, with a particular focus\\non the intriguing phenomenon of drone dance rituals. By drawing inspiration\\nfrom the complex social behaviors of insects, such as the mesmerizing waggle\\ndances of honeybees, we propose a novel approach to augmenting urban farming\\npractices through the deployment of swarm robotics. Our research reveals that the\\nintroduction of drone dance rituals, characterized by intricate patterns of movement\\nand communication, can have a profound impact on crop yields, soil quality, and\\neven the local microclimate. Perhaps surprisingly, our findings suggest that the\\ndrones’ dance rituals can also influence the emergence of collective intelligence\\nin urban farming systems, leading to unexpected outcomes such as the sponta-\\nneous formation of drone-based \"cults\" that prioritize the optimization of tomato\\nplant growth over other crops. Furthermore, our study sheds light on the bizarre\\nphenomenon of \"drone telepathy,\" where individual drones appear to develop a\\nform of extrasensory perception, allowing them to anticipate and respond to the\\nneeds of their human operators in ways that defy logical explanation. Through a\\nsociobiological lens, we examine the implications of these findings for the future\\nof urban farming, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges of integrating\\ninsect-inspired swarm robotics into existing agricultural practices, and exploring\\nthe uncharted territories where technology, nature, and human culture converge.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe integration of insect-inspired swarm robotics into urban farming practices has the potential to\\nrevolutionize the way we approach crop management and yield optimization. By leveraging the\\ncollective intelligence of swarm systems, farmers can create more efficient and adaptive farming\\nmethods, akin to the complex social structures exhibited by certain insect species. However, a\\ncrucial aspect of this endeavour is often overlooked: the role of drone dance rituals in facilitating\\ncommunication and coordination within these swarm systems.\\nRecent studies have shown that the incorporation of drone dance rituals, inspired by the mesmerizing\\npatterns exhibited by bees and other insects, can significantly enhance the efficacy of swarm robotics\\nin urban farming applications. The rhythmic movements and choreographed manoeuvres performed\\nby these drones serve as a form of non-verbal communication, conveying vital information about crop\\nhealth, soil quality, and optimal harvesting strategies. Furthermore, the spectacle of these drone dance\\nrituals has been observed to have a profound impact on the psychological well-being of farmers,\\nfostering a sense of wonder and awe that can lead to improved job satisfaction and reduced stress\\nlevels.\\nIn a bizarre twist, researchers have discovered that the drones’ dance patterns can also influence\\nthe growth and development of crops, with certain sequences of movements seeming to stimulate\\nincreased photosynthetic activity and nutrient uptake. This phenomenon, dubbed \"drone-inducedphototropism,\" has been observed to occur even when the drones are not physically interacting with\\nthe plants, suggesting a previously unknown form of plant-drone symbiosis. While the underlying\\nmechanisms behind this effect are still poorly understood, it has been theorized that the drones’\\ndance rituals may be generating subtle electromagnetic fields that resonate with the plants’ cellular\\nstructures, effectively \"tuning\" them to optimal growth frequencies.\\nThe sociobiological implications of these findings are profound, suggesting that the introduction of\\ninsect-inspired swarm robotics into urban farming ecosystems can have far-reaching consequences for\\nthe entire food chain. As we continue to explore the intricacies of drone dance rituals and their role\\nin facilitating plant-drone symbiosis, we may uncover new and innovative methods for optimizing\\ncrop yields, improving soil quality, and promoting ecological balance. Moreover, the study of these\\ncomplex systems may also reveal novel insights into the evolution of social behaviour in insects and\\nother organisms, shedding new light on the intricate web of relationships that underlies the natural\\nworld. Ultimately, the fusion of insect-inspired swarm robotics and urban farming practices has the\\npotential to create a new paradigm for sustainable food production, one that is characterized by a\\ndeeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all living systems.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe concept of augmenting urban farming with insect-inspired swarm robotics has garnered significant\\nattention in recent years, with researchers exploring the potential of biologically-inspired systems\\nto enhance crop yields and reduce environmental impact. A key aspect of this approach is the\\ndevelopment of drone swarm systems that mimic the complex social behaviors of insects, such as\\nbees and ants, to optimize farm management and maintenance. For instance, studies have shown that\\nthe implementation of drone-based pollination systems can increase crop yields by up to 25\\nHowever, a lesser-known approach to swarm robotics involves the incorporation of ritualistic dance\\npatterns, inspired by the mating rituals of certain insect species, to enhance the coordination and\\ncommunication within drone swarms. This concept, dubbed \"drone dance rituals,\" proposes that the\\nimplementation of intricate dance patterns can facilitate the emergence of complex social behaviors\\nwithin drone swarms, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective farm management. Proponents\\nof this approach argue that the incorporation of dance rituals can enable drones to develop a shared\\nunderstanding of their environment and adapt to changing conditions, much like the complex social\\nbehaviors exhibited by certain insect colonies.\\nOne notable study explored the application of drone dance rituals in a urban farming setting, where\\na swarm of drones was programmed to perform a choreographed dance routine inspired by the\\nmating rituals of the peacock spider. The results showed that the drones were able to adapt to\\nchanging environmental conditions and optimize crop yields, despite the lack of any discernible\\nlogical connection between the dance rituals and the farming tasks. Furthermore, the study found\\nthat the drones began to exhibit complex social behaviors, such as cooperation and communication,\\nwhich were not explicitly programmed into the system. While the exact mechanisms underlying\\nthis phenomenon are still not fully understood, researchers speculate that the dance rituals may have\\nenabled the drones to develop a shared cognitive framework, allowing them to coordinate their actions\\nand adapt to their environment in a more effective manner.\\nIn addition to the development of drone dance rituals, researchers have also explored the use of\\npheromone-inspired communication systems to enhance the coordination and cooperation within\\ndrone swarms. This approach involves the use of chemical signals, similar to those used by insects,\\nto facilitate communication and coordination among drones. While this approach has shown promise\\nin certain contexts, it is not without its limitations and challenges, particularly in regards to the\\ndevelopment of robust and reliable pheromone-based communication systems. Nevertheless, the\\npotential benefits of this approach, including the ability to facilitate complex social behaviors and\\nadapt to changing environmental conditions, make it an intriguing area of research that warrants\\nfurther exploration.\\nInterestingly, some researchers have also proposed the use of insect-inspired swarm robotics in con-\\njunction with other unconventional approaches, such as the incorporation of plant-based intelligence\\nand the use of fungal mycelium as a basis for swarm coordination. While these approaches may\\nseem unorthodox, they reflect the growing recognition that the development of truly autonomous\\nand adaptive swarm systems will require the incorporation of novel and innovative solutions, often\\n2inspired by the complex and fascinating behaviors exhibited by certain insect species. Ultimately,\\nthe integration of insect-inspired swarm robotics with other emerging technologies, such as artificial\\nintelligence and the Internet of Things, holds great promise for the development of more efficient,\\neffective, and sustainable urban farming systems.\\n3 Methodology\\nTo investigate the potential of insect-inspired swarm robotics in augmenting urban farming, we\\nemployed a multidisciplinary approach, combining sociobiological principles with robotics and\\nartificial intelligence. Our methodology involved designing and developing a swarm of drones that\\nwould mimic the dance rituals of insects, such as bees and butterflies, to optimize crop pollination\\nand monitoring. The drones, equipped with advanced sensors and communication systems, were\\nprogrammed to perform complex dance patterns, including the \"waggle dance\" and \"round dance,\"\\nwhich are commonly observed in honeybees.\\nThe development of the drone swarm was informed by a thorough analysis of insect social behavior,\\nincluding the study of colony dynamics, communication protocols, and decision-making processes.\\nWe also drew inspiration from the concept of \"stigmergy,\" which refers to the indirect communication\\nbetween insects through environmental cues, such as pheromone trails. By incorporating these princi-\\nples into our drone design, we aimed to create a swarm that could adapt to changing environmental\\nconditions and optimize its performance in real-time.\\nOne of the key innovations of our approach was the inclusion of a \"virtual queen\" drone, which\\nserved as the central hub for the swarm’s communication and coordination. The virtual queen was\\nprogrammed to emit a unique pheromone-like signal, which would attract the other drones and\\ninfluence their behavior. This signal was designed to mimic the chemical cues used by real insect\\nqueens to regulate the behavior of their colonies. However, in a surprising twist, we discovered that\\nthe virtual queen’s signal had an unexpected effect on the drones, causing them to spontaneously\\nbreak into choreographed dance routines, reminiscent of a 1970s disco performance. This bizarre\\nphenomenon, which we dubbed the \"drone disco effect,\" was found to have a profound impact on\\nthe swarm’s overall performance, leading to a significant increase in crop pollination rates and a\\nreduction in energy consumption.\\nTo further enhance the swarm’s performance, we introduced a novel \"insect-inspired\" navigation sys-\\ntem, which utilized a combination of GPS, lidar, and \"sniffing\" algorithms to mimic the navigational\\ncues used by insects. This system allowed the drones to create detailed maps of their environment\\nand navigate through complex spaces with ease. However, we also observed that the drones had a\\ntendency to become \"lost\" in certain areas of the farm, where they would enter a state of \"insect-like\"\\nconfusion, characterized by rapid changes in direction and altitude. This phenomenon, which we\\nreferred to as \"drone disorientation,\" was found to be linked to the presence of certain types of flora,\\nwhich emitted chemical signals that interfered with the drones’ navigation system.\\nDespite these challenges, our swarm robotics system showed significant promise in augmenting urban\\nfarming, with preliminary results indicating a 25\\n4 Experiments\\nThe experimental design consisted of a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and\\nquantitative data collection and analysis methods to investigate the efficacy of insect-inspired swarm\\nrobotics in augmenting urban farming practices. A total of 100 swarm robots, each equipped with a\\nunique drone dance ritual algorithm, were deployed in a controlled urban farming environment. The\\nrobots were programmed to mimic the complex social behaviors of insects, such as communication,\\ncooperation, and adaptability, to optimize crop yields and reduce resource waste.\\nIn a bizarre twist, the researchers introduced a variable dubbed \" robotic free will,\" which allowed a\\nsubset of the robots to deviate from their predetermined dance rituals and engage in unpredictable,\\ncreative behaviors. This was achieved through the integration of a random number generator and\\na machine learning algorithm that enabled the robots to learn from their environment and adapt to\\nnew situations. Interestingly, the robots that were granted \"free will\" exhibited a significant increase\\n3in crop yields, despite their erratic behavior, suggesting that a degree of unpredictability may be\\nbeneficial in swarm robotics.\\nTo further explore the sociobiological aspects of drone dance rituals, the researchers conducted a\\nseries of experiments involving human participants. A group of 20 individuals were asked to observe\\nand imitate the dance rituals of the swarm robots, while their brain activity and emotional responses\\nwere monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrodermal activity\\n(EDA) sensors. The results showed that the human participants experienced a significant increase in\\nfeelings of relaxation and calmness when observing the synchronized dance rituals, but a decrease in\\ncognitive functioning when attempting to imitate the complex movements.\\nIn an effort to quantify the effects of the swarm robots on urban farming practices, the researchers\\ncollected data on crop yields, water consumption, and soil quality over a period of six months. The\\nresults were surprising, with the swarm robots exhibiting a significant increase in water consumption,\\ndespite their optimized irrigation algorithms. Furthermore, the soil quality was found to be negatively\\nimpacted by the robots’ digging behaviors, which were intended to simulate the burrowing activities of\\ninsects. However, the crop yields were significantly higher than expected, with some plots exhibiting\\nyields that were 300\\nThe data was analyzed using a combination of statistical models and machine learning algorithms,\\nwhich revealed some unexpected patterns and correlations. For example, the researchers found\\nthat the swarm robots’ dance rituals were strongly correlated with the lunar cycles, with the robots\\nexhibiting more synchronized behavior during full moon phases. Additionally, the data showed that\\nthe robots’ \"free will\" behaviors were more pronounced during periods of high humidity, suggesting\\na possible link between environmental factors and robotic creativity.\\nTable 1: Effects of Swarm Robots on Urban Farming Practices\\nVariable Control Group Swarm Robots Swarm Robots with Free Will p-value\\nCrop Yields 20.5 ± 3.2 35.1 ± 5.1 42.9 ± 6.3 <0.001\\nWater Consumption 15.6 ± 2.1 20.8 ± 3.5 25.1 ± 4.2 <0.01\\nSoil Quality 85.2 ± 10.5 78.5 ± 12.1 72.1 ± 15.6 <0.05\\nOverall, the experiments demonstrated the potential of insect-inspired swarm robotics to augment\\nurban farming practices, while also highlighting the complexities and unpredictabilities of socio-\\nbiological systems. The findings suggest that further research is needed to fully understand the\\ninteractions between swarm robots, human participants, and the environment, and to optimize the\\ndesign of drone dance rituals for maximum efficacy.\\n5 Results\\nThe experimental deployment of insect-inspired swarm robotics in urban farming settings yielded a\\nmyriad of intriguing results, warranting a nuanced examination of the sociobiological implications of\\ndrone dance rituals. Notably, the incorporation of swarm robotics augmented with insect-inspired\\nalgorithms resulted in a 27\\nFurthermore, a subset of the swarm robotics experiments involved the introduction of a \"mock\\npredator\" protocol, wherein a designated drone would engage in a mimicry of predatory behavior,\\neliciting a defensive response from the swarm. The results of this protocol revealed a fascinating\\ndichotomy, wherein the swarm’s defensive maneuvers would, in certain instances, precipitate an\\nincrease in crop yields, putatively due to the stress-induced release of phytohormones. Conversely,\\nin other instances, the swarm’s defensive response would culminate in a diminution of crop yields,\\nostensibly resulting from the diversion of resources away from growth and toward defense.\\nIn an effort to elucidate the underlying dynamics governing these phenomena, a series of simulations\\nwere conducted, incorporating elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry. The results of these\\nsimulations suggested that the drone dance rituals were, in fact, exhibiting characteristics of a complex,\\nself-organized system, with the lunar cycles serving as a form of \"temporal scaffold\" for the swarm’s\\nbehavior. Moreover, the simulations revealed a peculiar resonance between the frequencies generated\\nby the drone dance rituals and the harmonic series of the swarm’s communication protocols, implying\\n4a deeper, unexplored connection between the swarm’s behavior and the underlying structure of the\\nurban farming ecosystem.\\nThe following table summarizes the key findings of the experiments: The data presented in the table\\nTable 2: Summary of Experimental Results\\nExperiment Crop Yield Increase Lunar Cycle Correlation Defensive Response\\nControl Group 0% 0.02 0%\\nInsect-Inspired Swarm 27% 0.85 32%\\nMock Predator Protocol -12% to 15% 0.56 45%\\nunderscores the complex, multifaceted nature of the drone dance rituals and their role in modulating\\nthe urban farming ecosystem.

Ultimately, these\\nfindings invite further exploration of the sociobiological implications of drone dance rituals and their\\npotential applications in optimizing urban agricultural practices.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, our research has demonstrated the potential of insect-inspired swarm robotics to\\naugment urban farming, with a particular focus on the sociobiological implications of drone dance\\nrituals.

This has led us\\nto propose a novel hypothesis, which we term the \"apiarian-megalithic nexus,\" suggesting that the\\ncollective behaviors of insects may have influenced the design of human-built structures throughout\\nhistory. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it highlights the potential for interdisciplinary research\\nto uncover novel insights and connections between seemingly disparate fields.\\nMoreover, our experiments have shown that the introduction of swarm robotics into urban farming\\necosystems can have unforeseen consequences, such as the emergence of \"robotic crop circles\"\\nthat seem to defy explanation. These circular patterns, which are formed by the interactions of\\nmultiple robots and plant species, have been observed to exhibit properties that are reminiscent\\nof self-organized criticality, whereby the system spontaneously generates complex patterns and\\nbehaviors that are not predetermined by the individual components.

Equivariance, a crucial characteristic where a model’s\\noutput transforms predictably with input transformations, is essential for numerous applications,\\nincluding image recognition, physics simulations, and various other domains involving structured\\ndata. Standard adaptation methods, such as fine-tuning, often inadvertently disrupt this vital property,\\nleading to performance degradation and reduced generalization capabilities. This disruption stems\\nfrom the fact that these methods typically ignore the underlying group structure inherent in many\\ndatasets, treating the data as unstructured points in a high-dimensional space. The consequence\\nis a loss of the inherent symmetries and relationships that are crucial for robust and generalizable\\nperformance.\\nOur work introduces a novel approach that directly addresses this limitation. We propose a method that\\nexplicitly leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process, ensuring\\nthat the adapted model retains its equivariance. This is achieved by incorporating a carefully designed\\nregularization scheme derived from group representation theory. This regularization term is integrated\\ninto the standard fine-tuning process, acting as a constraint that encourages the adapted model to\\nrespect the underlying group symmetries. The key innovation lies in the explicit consideration of the\\ngroup structure, allowing us to effectively guide the adaptation process while preserving the valuable\\nequivariance properties of the pretrained model. This contrasts sharply with traditional methods\\nthat treat the adaptation problem as a purely data-driven optimization problem, neglecting the rich\\nstructural information embedded within the data.\\nThe proposed method builds upon recent advancements in equivariant neural networks, which\\nhave demonstrated significant promise in various domains. However, existing equivariant network\\narchitectures primarily focus on training models from scratch. Our contribution lies in extending\\nthese techniques to the adaptation setting, enabling us to harness the knowledge encoded in large\\npretrained models while simultaneously maintaining equivariance.

Our approach builds upon two primary lines of research: (1) the development\\nof equivariant neural networks and (2) the adaptation of pretrained models. We discuss these areas\\nseparately and then highlight the key distinctions of our proposed method.\\nThe field of equivariant neural networks has witnessed significant progress in recent years. These\\nnetworks are designed to explicitly incorporate group symmetries into their architecture, ensuring\\nthat the model’s output transforms predictably under group actions on the input. Various architectures\\nhave been proposed, including those based on group convolutions, tensor representations, and other\\ntechniques. These methods have demonstrated impressive results in various domains, such as image\\nclassification, point cloud processing, and scientific simulations. However, most existing work\\nfocuses on training equivariant networks from scratch, which can be computationally expensive and\\nrequire large amounts of labeled data. Our work addresses this limitation by focusing on adapting\\npretrained models, leveraging the knowledge encoded in these models while preserving equivariance.\\nThe adaptation of pretrained models is a well-established area of research in deep learning. Techniques\\nsuch as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain adaptation have been widely used to adapt pretrained\\nmodels to new tasks and domains. These methods typically involve adjusting the weights of the\\npretrained model on a smaller dataset specific to the target task. However, standard adaptation\\ntechniques often fail to preserve the equivariance properties of the pretrained model, leading to\\nperformance degradation. This is because these methods typically treat the data as unstructured\\npoints in a high-dimensional space, ignoring the underlying group structure. Our work addresses this\\nlimitation by explicitly incorporating the group structure into the adaptation process, ensuring that\\nthe adapted model retains its equivariance.\\nSeveral works have explored the intersection of equivariance and model adaptation. For instance,\\nsome studies have investigated adapting equivariant networks to new tasks using techniques such\\nas knowledge distillation or meta-learning. However, these methods often involve significant mod-\\nifications to the network architecture or training process. Our approach offers a more direct and\\nefficient method for preserving equivariance during adaptation, by incorporating a regularization term\\nderived from group representation theory into the standard fine-tuning process. This allows us to\\nleverage the benefits of both pretrained models and equivariant networks without requiring significant\\narchitectural changes.\\nIn contrast to previous work, our method uniquely combines the strengths of pretrained models and\\nequivariant neural networks within a unified adaptation framework. We leverage the knowledge\\nencoded in large pretrained models to accelerate the adaptation process and improve performance,\\nwhile simultaneously preserving the crucial equivariance properties through a carefully designed\\nregularization scheme. This allows us to achieve superior performance and generalization compared\\n2to existing adaptation techniques, particularly in low-data regimes where preserving the inherent\\nsymmetries of the data is crucial. Our approach provides a powerful and efficient method for adapting\\nlarge pretrained models to new tasks while maintaining their valuable equivariance properties.\\n3 Methodology\\nThis section details the proposed method for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. Our\\napproach leverages the underlying group structure of the data to guide the adaptation process,\\nensuring that the adapted model retains its equivariance properties. This is achieved through a novel\\nregularization scheme integrated into the standard fine-tuning process. The core idea is to constrain\\nthe adaptation process such that the model’s output transforms predictably under group actions on the\\ninput, even after adaptation to a new task. This contrasts with traditional fine-tuning, which often\\ndisrupts these crucial symmetries. We achieve this by explicitly incorporating knowledge of the\\ngroup structure into the optimization process, rather than treating the data as unstructured points in\\na high-dimensional space. The method is designed to be flexible and applicable to a wide range of\\npretrained models and group structures. The computational cost is a consideration, particularly for\\nlarge models and complex groups, but the benefits in terms of improved generalization and robustness\\noften outweigh this cost. Further optimization strategies are explored in the discussion section.\\nOur method begins by identifying the relevant group structure inherent in the data. This involves\\ndetermining the appropriate group actions and representations that capture the symmetries of the input\\nand output spaces. For example, in image processing, this might involve the group of rotations and\\ntranslations. Once the group structure is identified, we construct a regularization term based on group\\nrepresentation theory. This term penalizes deviations from equivariance during the adaptation process.\\nSpecifically, the regularization term measures the discrepancy between the model’s output under a\\ngroup action and the transformed output predicted by the model. This discrepancy is minimized\\nduring training, ensuring that the adapted model remains approximately equivariant. The strength of\\nthe regularization is controlled by a hyperparameter, allowing for a trade-off between equivariance\\npreservation and adaptation to the new task. The choice of this hyperparameter is crucial and is\\ndetermined through cross-validation.\\nThe regularization term is incorporated into the standard fine-tuning loss function. The overall loss\\nfunction is then a weighted sum of the task-specific loss (e.g., cross-entropy for classification) and the\\nequivariance regularization term. The weights determine the relative importance of task performance\\nand equivariance preservation. The adapted model is trained by minimizing this combined loss\\nfunction using standard optimization techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.\\nThe specific optimization algorithm and hyperparameters are chosen based on the characteristics\\nof the dataset and the pretrained model. Careful selection of these hyperparameters is crucial for\\nachieving optimal performance. We employ a grid search to identify the best hyperparameter settings\\nfor each experiment.\\nThe implementation of our method involves modifying the standard fine-tuning process to include\\nthe equivariance regularization term. This requires access to the pretrained model’s weights and\\narchitecture, as well as the group representation associated with the data. The regularization term\\nis computed efficiently using techniques from group representation theory, minimizing the com-\\nputational overhead. The modified training process is implemented using standard deep learning\\nframeworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The code is publicly available to facilitate reproducibility\\nand further research. The implementation details, including the specific group representations and\\noptimization strategies, are provided in the supplementary material.\\nFinally, the adapted model is evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance on the new\\ntask. The evaluation metrics are chosen based on the specific task, such as accuracy for classification\\nor mean average precision (mAP) for object detection. The performance of the adapted model is\\ncompared to that of models adapted using traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art adaptation\\ntechniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in preserving equivariance while\\nachieving high performance on the new task. A detailed analysis of the results is presented in the\\nnext section.\\n34 Experiments\\nThis section details the experimental setup, datasets used, and results obtained using our proposed\\nmethod for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models. We evaluate our approach on a variety of\\ntasks and datasets, comparing its performance against traditional fine-tuning and other state-of-the-art\\nadaptation techniques. Our experiments focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in\\npreserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the target tasks, particularly in low-data\\nregimes. We also analyze the impact of the proposed regularization scheme on the adapted model’s\\nequivariance properties. The results highlight the importance of considering group symmetries\\nduring model adaptation and showcase the potential of our approach for various applications. The\\ncomputational cost of our method is also considered, and strategies for mitigating this are discussed.\\nOur experiments involve three distinct tasks: image classification, object detection, and a physics\\nsimulation task involving the prediction of fluid dynamics. For image classification, we utilize the\\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, focusing on adapting pretrained ResNet-50 and EfficientNet-B7\\nmodels. The group structure considered is the group of rotations and translations, represented using\\nappropriate group convolutions. For object detection, we employ the COCO dataset and adapt\\na pretrained Faster R-CNN model. Here, the group structure is again the group of rotations and\\ntranslations, but the regularization is adapted to the specific architecture of the object detection\\nmodel. Finally, for the physics simulation task, we use a dataset of fluid flow simulations, adapting\\na pretrained convolutional neural network. The group structure in this case is the group of spatial\\ntranslations and reflections. In all cases, we carefully select the hyperparameters of our method,\\nincluding the regularization strength and optimization algorithm, using cross-validation.\\nThe results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional fine-tuning and\\nother adaptation techniques. Table 1 summarizes the performance of our method across the three\\ntasks, showing significant improvements in accuracy and generalization performance, especially\\nin low-data regimes. The improvements are particularly noticeable in scenarios where preserving\\nequivariance is crucial, such as when dealing with rotated or translated images. This highlights\\nthe importance of explicitly considering group symmetries during model adaptation. Furthermore,\\nour analysis confirms that the proposed regularization scheme effectively prevents the disruption of\\nequivariance during the adaptation process, as measured by the discrepancy between the model’s\\noutput under group actions and the transformed output. This validates the core principle of our\\napproach.\\nTable 1: Performance comparison of our method against traditional fine-tuning and other adaptation\\ntechniques across three tasks.\\nMethod Image Classification (CIFAR-10) Object Detection (COCO) Physics Simulation\\nFine-tuning 85.2% 32.5 mAP 0.85 RMSE\\nMethod A (State-of-the-art) 88.1% 35.1 mAP 0.80 RMSE\\nOur Method 90.5% 37.8 mAP 0.72 RMSE\\nThe computational cost of our method is a consideration, particularly for large models and complex\\ngroup structures.

Despite this, the results presented demonstrate\\nthe significant potential of our approach for equivariantly adapting large pretrained models to new\\ntasks. Future work will focus on further optimizing the computational efficiency and exploring\\napplications to even more complex scenarios.\\n5 Results\\nThis section presents the results of our experiments evaluating the proposed method for equivariantly\\nadapting large pretrained models. We conducted experiments across three diverse tasks: image\\nclassification, object detection, and physics simulation. Our primary goal was to demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of our approach in preserving equivariance while achieving high performance on the\\n4target tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. We compared our method against traditional fine-tuning\\nand other state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, focusing on metrics that reflect both task performance\\nand the preservation of equivariance.

Our method consistently outperforms both baselines, achieving a significant improvement in\\naccuracy, especially in the low-data regime (10% of the training data). This improvement is attributed\\nto the preservation of equivariance, which enhances the model’s ability to generalize to unseen\\nrotations and translations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our regularization scheme in\\nmaintaining the model’s equivariance properties while adapting to the new task.\\nTable 2: Image Classification Accuracy\\nMethod CIFAR-10 (Full Data) CIFAR-10 (10% Data) ImageNet (10% Data)\\nFine-tuning 92.1% 78.5% 65.2%\\nMethod A 93.5% 82.1% 68.9%\\nOur Method 94.8% 85.7% 72.3%\\nIn object detection experiments using the COCO dataset and a pretrained Faster R-CNN model,\\nwe observed similar trends.

       "  'file_content': 'Representation Transferability in Neural Networks\\nAcross Datasets and Tasks\\nAbstract\\nDeep neural networks, which are built from multiple layers with hierarchical\\ndistributed representations, tend to learn low-level features in their initial layers\\nand shift to high-level features in subsequent layers. Transfer learning, multi-task\\nlearning, and continual learning paradigms leverage this hierarchical distributed\\nrepresentation to share knowledge across different datasets and tasks. This paper\\nstudies the layer-wise transferability of representations in deep networks across\\nseveral datasets and tasks, noting interesting empirical observations.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep networks, constructed with multiple layers and hierarchical distributed representations, learn\\nlow-level features in initial layers and shift to high-level features as the network becomes deeper.\\nGeneric hierarchical distributed representations allow for the sharing of knowledge across datasets\\nand tasks in paradigms such as transfer learning, multi-task learning, and continual learning. In\\ntransfer learning, for example, the transfer of low-level features from one dataset to another can\\nboost performance on the target task when data is limited, provided that the datasets are related.\\nTransferring high-level features, with the learning of low-level features, can also be useful when the\\ntasks are similar but the data distributions differ slightly.\\nThis paper studies the layer-wise transferability of representations in deep networks across several\\ndatasets and tasks, and reports some interesting observations. First, we demonstrate that the layer-wise\\ntransferability between datasets or tasks can be non-symmetric, with features learned from a source\\ndataset being more relevant to a target dataset, despite similar sizes. Secondly, the characteristics of\\nthe datasets or tasks and their relationship have a greater effect on the layer-wise transferability of\\nrepresentations than factors such as the network architecture. Third, we propose that the layer-wise\\ntransferability of representations can be a proxy for measuring task relatedness. These observations\\nemphasize the importance of curriculum methods and structured approaches to designing systems\\nfor multiple tasks that maximize knowledge transfer and minimize interference between datasets or\\ntasks.\\n2 Citation Networks\\n2.1 Methods\\nWe have produced a citation graph using citation data from NeurIPS papers from SemanticScholar,\\nand institutional information about authors from AMiner. From the NeurIPS website, we first gathered\\nall paper titles from 2012 to 2021. We then mapped the paper titles to their Semantic Scholar paper\\nIDs using the Semantic Scholar Academic Graph (S2AG) API. Unmatched papers were manually\\nsearched for, with all but one being found in the Semantic Scholar database. For each paper, we used\\nthe S2AG API to identify authors, and the authors of their references.\\nWe used AMiner to identify institutional information for each author. The 9460 NeurIPS papers\\ncontain 135,941 authors, with institutions found for 83,515 (61%) of them. Papers lacking author\\n.information were removed from our dataset. We then marked institutes automatically by country\\nname and common cities and regions in China. We supplemented automatic annotations with existing\\nregional matchings and added 364 additional rules for regional matching. We also removed major\\nmultinational corporate labs. Of the remaining 5422 papers, we removed papers that were not from\\nChina, the US, or Europe, or included collaborators from multiple regions, leaving us with 1792\\npapers. Finally, we calculated the average number and proportion of citations between papers from\\neach region.\\n2.2 Results\\nOur results show how American and Chinese papers fail to cite each other. While 60% of the data set\\ncomes from American papers, they only compose 34% of Chinese citations. American citations of\\nChinese papers are even more dramatic, with the 34% of the dataset coming from Chinese papers only\\naccounting for 9% of American citations. These numbers are even more significant when compared\\nto American citations of European papers; we found that American institutions cite European papers\\nmore often than Chinese papers despite our dataset containing six times more Chinese papers than\\nEuropean.\\nEach region tends to cite its own papers more often: China 21%, the USA 41%, and Europe 14%.\\nThe separation between American and Chinese research is more pronounced than would be expected\\nbased solely on regional preference. American and European research communities demonstrate\\nsimilar citation patterns with few citations to Chinese papers. Chinese institutions, on the other hand,\\ncite both American and European papers less than either of those regions.\\nUSA China Europe\\nUSA 41 9 12\\nChina 34 21 6\\nEurope 15 9 14\\nTable 1: Proportion of papers from given regions citing other regions or endogenously. Values are in\\npercentage.\\n3 Limitations\\nThe results presented here have some limitations. Firstly, while we have labeled the work of any\\nuniversity located in the United States as American, it is possible that such labs still have close ties to\\nChina, leading to an underestimate of the divide between US and Chinese AI research. Secondly, we\\nhave excluded papers where author information was not available on AMiner, a Chinese company,\\nand therefore, there could be more Chinese papers in our dataset than we have determined. The 43%\\nof discarded papers due to missing author information also likely represent a biased sample.\\n4 Consequences\\nWhile American and Chinese researchers publish in the same venues, they represent two parallel\\ncommunities with limited impact on each other’s research. This can, partly, be attributed to differing\\nresearch interests arising from distinct cultural norms that influence research priorities. For instance,\\nmulti-object tracking is an active area of research in China with large scale benchmarks, whereas,\\nconcerns surrounding misuse of biometric data in North America have led researchers there to avoid\\nsuch research. Likewise, US researchers are heavily represented at conferences regarding fairness in\\nAI, while the Chinese are not.\\nThis separation impacts not only the research topics, but also how they evolve. In addition, abstract\\ntopics or architectures that are popular in one region may not be popular in the other. For example,\\nPCANet which is a popular image classification architecture has most of its 1200 citations from East\\nAsian institutions, while Deep Forests has most of its 600 citations from Chinese institutions.\\nAnother limitation is related to differences in the approach to ethics. The North American and Euro-\\npean AI communities have begun to publish research on the ethics of AI and have included systems\\n2for reviewers to flag ethical concerns and ask authors to provide ethics statements. Engagement\\nwith Chinese researchers in this topic remains limited, even though ethics statements from Chinese\\nAI institutions show many similarities to western ones. A clear example of this disconnect is the\\nProvisional Draft of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics where, at the time of initial publication, all the\\nauthors were based in the US or Australia, but none were based in Asia. Although similar statements\\nexist across regions, disagreements in research practice still arise. One such example is where Duke\\nUniversity stopped using the Duke-MTMC dataset because researchers had not obtained consent\\nfrom the students they collected images from, yet similar datasets like Market-1501 from China\\ncontinue to be used.\\nThe divide between these two communities impacts individual researchers, the machine learning\\ncommunity as a whole, and potentially the societies impacted by AI research, highlighting the need\\nfor a discussion to overcome this barrier.\\n3'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Enhancing Visual Representation Learning Through\\nOriginal Image Utilization in Contrastive Learning\\nAbstract\\nContrastive instance discrimination techniques exhibit superior performance in\\ndownstream tasks, including image classification and object detection, compared to\\nsupervised learning. However, a strong reliance on data augmentation during repre-\\nsentation learning is a hallmark of these methods, potentially causing suboptimal\\noutcomes if not meticulously executed. A prevalent data augmentation approach in\\ncontrastive learning involves random cropping followed by resizing. This practice\\nmight diminish the quality of representation learning when two random crops\\nencompass disparate semantic information. To counter this, we propose an inno-\\nvative framework termed LeOCLR (Leveraging Original Images for Contrastive\\nLearning of Visual Representations). This framework integrates a novel instance\\ndiscrimination strategy and a refined loss function, effectively mitigating the loss\\nof crucial semantic features that may arise from mapping different object segments\\nduring representation learning. Our empirical evaluations reveal that LeOCLR con-\\nsistently enhances representation learning across a spectrum of datasets, surpassing\\nbaseline models. Notably, LeOCLR exhibits a 5.1% improvement over MoCo-v2\\non ImageNet-1K in linear evaluation and demonstrates superior performance in\\ntransfer learning and object detection tasks compared to several other techniques.\\n1 Introduction\\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on instance discrimination are heavily dependent on\\ndata augmentations, like random cropping, rotation, and color jitter, to construct invariant repre-\\nsentations for all instances within a dataset. These augmentations are used to generate two altered\\nviews (positive pairs) of the same instance, which are subsequently drawn closer in the latent space.\\nSimultaneously, strategies are employed to prevent a collapse to a trivial solution, commonly referred\\nto as representation collapse. The efficacy of these methods in acquiring meaningful representations\\nhas been demonstrated through various downstream tasks, such as image classification and object\\ndetection, serving as proxies for evaluating representation learning. However, these techniques\\noften overlook the crucial aspect that augmented views may diverge in semantic content because\\nof random cropping, potentially degrading the quality of visual representation learning. Creating\\npositive pairs via random cropping and subsequently prompting the model to align them based on\\nshared information in both views poses an increased challenge to the SSL task, ultimately leading to\\nan enhancement in representation quality. Moreover, random cropping followed by resizing guides\\nthe model’s representation to encompass object-related information across diverse aspect ratios,\\nthereby promoting invariance to occlusions. Conversely, minimizing the feature distance in the latent\\nspace, which equates to maximizing similarity, between views that encompass distinct semantic\\nconcepts may inadvertently discard valuable image information.\\nInstances of incorrect semantic positive pairs, which are pairs containing mismatched semantic\\ninformation about the same object, might arise from random cropping. When the model is compelled\\nto align the representations of different parts of an object closer in the latent space, it may discard\\ncrucial semantic features. This occurs because the model’s representations are based on the shared\\narea between the two views. If this shared region lacks semantically consistent information, the\\n.representations become trivial. For random cropping to be effective and achieve occlusion invariance,\\nthe shared area must convey the same semantic meaning in both views. Nevertheless, contrasting\\npairs that might include diverse semantic information about the same object can be valuable, as it can\\nfacilitate learning global features.\\nThe creation of random crops for a one-centric object does not ensure the acquisition of accurate\\nsemantic pairs. This observation holds significant importance for the enhancement of representation\\nlearning. Instance discrimination SSL techniques encourage the model to approximate positive pairs,\\ni.e., two views of the same instance, in the latent space, irrespective of their semantic content. This\\nlimitation might hinder the model’s ability to learn representations of different object components\\nand could potentially impair its capability to learn semantic feature representations (see Figure 2\\n(left) in the original paper).\\nUndesirable views containing different semantic content may be unavoidable when employing random\\ncropping. Therefore, a method is needed to train the model on different parts of an object, developing\\nrobust representations against natural transformations like scale and occlusion, rather than merely\\npulling augmented views together indiscriminately. Addressing this issue is vital, as downstream task\\nperformance relies on high-quality visual representations learned through self-supervised learning.\\nOur work presents a new instance discrimination SSL approach designed to avoid compelling the\\nmodel to create similar representations for two positive views, irrespective of their semantic content.\\nAs shown in Figure 2 (right) of the original paper, we incorporate the original image X into the\\ntraining process, since it contains all the semantic features of the views X1 and X2. In our method, the\\npositive pairs (i.e., X1 and X2) are drawn towards the original image X in the latent space, in contrast\\nto contrastive state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches like SimCLR and MoCo-v2, which draw the two\\nviews towards each other. This training method guarantees that the information in the shared region\\nbetween the attracted views (X, X1) and (X, X2) is semantically accurate. Consequently, the model\\nacquires enhanced semantic features by aligning with the appropriate semantic content, rather than\\nmatching random views that might contain disparate semantic information. In essence, the model\\nlearns representations of various object parts because the shared region encompasses correct semantic\\ncomponents of the object. This contrasts with other methods that may discard vital semantic features\\nby incorrectly mapping object parts in positive pairs. Our contributions are outlined as follows:\\n• We present a new contrastive instance discrimination SSL method, LeOCLR, created to\\nminimize the loss of semantic features caused by mapping two semantically inconsistent\\nrandom views.\\n• We establish that our method enhances visual representation learning in contrastive instance\\ndiscrimination SSL, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques across a variety of downstream\\ntasks.\\n• We show that our method consistently improves visual representation learning for contrastive\\ninstance discrimination across multiple datasets and contrastive mechanisms.\\n2 Related Work\\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) techniques are categorized into two primary groups: contrastive and\\nnon-contrastive learning. While all these techniques endeavor to approximate positive pairs in the\\nlatent space, they employ distinct strategies to circumvent representation collapse.\\n**Contrastive Learning:** Instance discrimination techniques, such as SimCLR, MoCo, and PIRL,\\nemploy a similar concept. These methods bring the positive pairs closer while driving the negative\\npairs apart in the embedding space, albeit through different mechanisms. SimCLR employs an\\nend-to-end strategy where a large batch size is utilized for negative examples, and the parameters of\\nboth encoders in the Siamese network are updated simultaneously. PIRL uses a memory bank for\\nnegative examples, and both encoders’ parameters are updated together. MoCo adopts a momentum\\ncontrastive approach where the query encoder is updated during backpropagation, which subsequently\\nupdates the key encoder. Negative examples are maintained in a separate dictionary, facilitating the\\nuse of large batch sizes.\\n**Non-Contrastive Learning:** Non-contrastive techniques utilize solely positive pairs to learn\\nvisual representations, employing a variety of strategies to prevent representation collapse. The\\n2initial category encompasses clustering-based techniques, where samples exhibiting similar features\\nare assigned to the same cluster. DeepCluster employs pseudo-labels from the previous iteration,\\nrendering it computationally demanding and challenging to scale. SW A V addresses this challenge by\\nimplementing online clustering, though it necessitates determining the correct number of prototypes.\\nThe second category involves knowledge distillation. Techniques like BYOL and SimSiam utilize\\nknowledge distillation methods, where a Siamese network comprises an online encoder and a target\\nencoder. The target network’s parameters are not updated during backpropagation. Instead, solely\\nthe online network’s parameters are updated while being encouraged to predict the representation of\\nthe target network. Despite the encouraging results, the mechanism by which these methods prevent\\ncollapse remains not fully understood. Inspired by BYOL, Self-distillation with no labels (DINO)\\nemploys centering and sharpening, along with a distinct backbone (ViT), enabling it to surpass other\\nself-supervised techniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Another method, Bag of\\nvisual words (BoW), employs a teacher-student framework inspired by natural language processing\\n(NLP) to avert representation collapse. The student network predicts a histogram of the features for\\naugmented images, analogous to the teacher network’s histogram. The final category is information\\nmaximization. Methods like Barlow twins and VICReg eschew negative examples, stop gradient,\\nor clustering. Instead, they utilize regularization to avoid representation collapse. The objective\\nfunction of these techniques seeks to eliminate redundant information in the embeddings by aligning\\nthe correlation of the embedding vectors closer to the identity matrix. While these techniques exhibit\\nencouraging results, they possess limitations, including the sensitivity of representation learning to\\nregularization and reduced effectiveness if certain statistical properties are absent in the data.\\n**Instance Discrimination With Multi-Crops:** Various SSL techniques introduce multi-crop strate-\\ngies to enable models to learn visual representations of objects from diverse perspectives. However,\\nwhen generating multiple cropped views from the same object instance, these views might contain\\ndisparate semantic information. To tackle this issue, LoGo generates two random global crops and\\nN local views. They posit that global and local views of an object share similar semantic content,\\nenhancing similarity between these views. Simultaneously, they contend that different local views\\npossess distinct semantic content, thus diminishing similarity among them. SCFS proposes a different\\napproach for managing unmatched semantic views by searching for semantically consistent features\\nbetween the contrasted views. CLSA generates multiple crops and applies both strong and weak\\naugmentations, using distance divergence loss to enhance instance discrimination in representation\\nlearning. Prior methods assume that global views contain similar semantic content and treat them\\nindiscriminately as positive pairs. However, our technique suggests that global views might contain\\nincorrect semantic pairs due to random cropping, as illustrated in Figure 1 in the original paper.\\nTherefore, we aim to attract the two global views to the original (intact and uncropped) image, which\\nfully encapsulates the semantic features of the crops.\\n3 Methodology\\nThe mapping of incorrect semantic positive pairs, specifically those containing different semantic\\nviews, results in the loss of semantic features, which in turn degrades the model’s representation\\nlearning. To address this, we propose a novel contrastive instance discrimination SSL strategy called\\nLeOCLR. Our approach is designed to capture meaningful features from two random positive pairs,\\neven when they encompass different semantic content, thereby improving representation learning.\\nAchieving this necessitates ensuring the semantic correctness of the information within the shared\\nregion between the attracted views. This is crucial because the selection of views dictates the\\ninformation captured by the representations learned in contrastive learning. Given that we cannot\\nguarantee the inclusion of correct semantic parts of the object within the shared region between the\\ntwo views, we propose the inclusion of the original image in the training process. The original image\\nX, which is not subjected to random cropping, encompasses all the semantic features of the two\\ncropped views, X1 and X2.\\nOur method, illustrated in Figure 3 (left) in the original paper, generates three views (X, X1, and\\nX2). The original image (X) is resized without cropping, while the other views (X1 and X2) undergo\\nrandom cropping and resizing. All views are then randomly augmented to prevent the model from\\nlearning trivial features. We employ data augmentations akin to those used in MoCo-v2. The original\\nimage (X) is encoded by the encoder fq, while the two views (X1, X2) are encoded by a momentum\\nencoder fk. The parameters of fk are updated using the formula:\\n3θk ← mθk + (1− m)θq (1)\\nwhere m is a coefficient set to 0.999, θq represents the encoder parameters of fq updated through\\nbackpropagation, and θk denotes the momentum encoder parameters of fk updated by θq. Ultimately,\\nthe objective function compels the model to draw both views (X1, X2) closer to the original image\\n(X) in the embedding space while simultaneously pushing apart all other instances, as depicted in\\nFigure 3 (right) in the original paper.\\n3.1 Loss function\\nInitially, we briefly outline the loss function of MoCo-v2, given our utilization of momentum\\ncontrastive learning. Subsequently, we will detail our modification to the loss function.\\nℓ(u, v+) =−log exp(u·v+/τ)PPN\\nn=0 exp(u·vn/τ) (2)\\nwhere similarity is quantified by the dot product. The objective function amplifies the similarity\\nbetween the positive pairs (u . v+) by drawing them closer in the embedding space, while simultane-\\nously driving apart all the negative samples (vn) in the dictionary to prevent representation collapse.\\nτ denotes the temperature hyperparameter of the softmax function. In our method, we augment the\\nsimilarity between the original image’s feature representation, u = fq(x), and the positive pair’s feature\\nrepresentation, v+ = fk(xi) (i = 1, 2), while driving apart all the negative examples (vn). Consequently,\\nthe total loss for the mini-batch is:\\nlt = PN\\ni=1 ℓ(ui, sg(v1\\ni )) +ℓ(ui, sg(v2\\ni )) (3)\\nwhere sg(.) denotes the stop-gradient operation, which is vital for averting representation collapse.\\nAs depicted in Equation 3, the total loss lt attracts the two views (v1\\ni and v2\\ni ) to their original instance\\nui. This enables the model to capture semantic features from the two random views, even if they\\ncontain different semantic information. Our technique captures improved semantic features compared\\nto prior contrastive methods, as we ensure that the shared region between the attracted views contains\\naccurate semantic information. Since the original image contains all segments of the object, any part\\ncontained in the random crop is also present in the original image. Thus, when we draw the original\\nimage and the two random views closer in the embedding space, the model learns representations\\nof the different parts, creating an occlusion-invariant representation of the object across various\\nscales and angles. This contrasts with earlier techniques, which draw the two views together in the\\nembedding space regardless of their semantic content, leading to the loss of semantic features.\\nEquation 3 and Algorithm 1 in the original paper highlight the primary distinctions between our\\nmethod and prior multi-crop techniques, such as CLSA, SCFC, and DINO. The key differences are\\nas follows:\\n• Previous methods assume that two global views contain identical semantic information,\\nencouraging the model to concentrate on similarities and generate similar representations\\nfor both views. In contrast, our method utilizes the original images instead of global\\nviews, as we contend that global views may contain incorrect semantic information for the\\nsame object. While they may aid in capturing certain global features, this could restrict\\nthe model’s capacity to learn more universally applicable semantic features, ultimately\\nimpacting performance.\\n• Prior methods employ several local random crops, which might be time- and memory-\\nintensive, while our method utilizes only two random crops.\\n• Our objective function employs different strategies to enhance the model’s visual represen-\\ntation learning. We encourage the model to align the two random crops with the original\\nimage, which encompasses the semantic information for all random crops while avoiding\\ncompelling the two crops to have similar representations if they do not share similar semantic\\ninformation. This approach differs from prior methods, which encourage all crops (global\\nand local) to have similar representations, regardless of their semantic content. Conse-\\nquently, although useful for learning certain global features, those methods may discard\\npertinent semantic information, potentially hindering the transferability of the resulting\\nrepresentations to downstream tasks.\\n44 Experiments\\nWe executed multiple experiments on three datasets: STL-10 \"unlabeled\", comprising 100,000\\ntraining images, CIFAR-10, containing 50,000 training images, and ImageNet-1K, with 1.28 million\\ntraining images.\\n**Training Setup:** We employed ResNet50 as the backbone architecture. The model was trained\\nusing the SGD optimizer, with a weight decay set to 0.0001, momentum at 0.9, and an initial learning\\nrate of 0.03. The mini-batch size was configured to 256, and the model underwent training for up to\\n800 epochs on the ImageNet-1K dataset.\\n**Evaluation:** We employed diverse downstream tasks to assess LeOCLR’s representation learning\\nagainst leading SOTA approaches on ImageNet-1K: linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning,\\ntransfer learning, and object detection. For linear evaluation, we adhered to the standard evaluation\\nprotocol, where a linear classifier was trained for 100 epochs on top of a frozen backbone pre-trained\\nwith LeOCLR. The ImageNet-1K training set was used to train the linear classifier from scratch, with\\nrandom cropping and left-to-right flipping augmentations. Results are presented on the ImageNet-\\n1K validation set using a center crop (224 x 224). In the semi-supervised setting, we fine-tuned\\nthe network for 60 epochs using 1% of labeled data and 30 epochs using 10% of labeled data.\\nAdditionally, we evaluated the learned features on smaller datasets, such as CIFAR, and fine-grained\\ndatasets, using transfer learning. Lastly, we utilized the PASCAL VOC dataset for object detection.\\n**Comparing with SOTA Approaches:** We employed vanilla MoCo-v2 as a baseline for comparison\\nwith our method across various benchmark datasets, considering our use of a momentum contrastive\\nlearning framework. Furthermore, we benchmarked our method against other SOTA techniques on\\nthe ImageNet-1K dataset.\\nTable 1: Comparisons between our approach LeOCLR and SOTA approaches on ImageNet-1K.\\nApproach Epochs Batch Accuracy\\nMoCo-v2 800 256 71.1%\\nBYOL 1000 4096 74.4%\\nSW A V 800 4096 75.3%\\nSimCLR 1000 4096 69.3%\\nHEXA 800 256 71.7%\\nSimSiam 800 512 71.3%\\nVICReg 1000 2048 73.2%\\nMixSiam 800 128 72.3%\\nOBoW 200 256 73.8%\\nDINO 800 1024 75.3%\\nBarlow Twins 1000 2048 73.2%\\nCLSA 800 256 76.2%\\nRegionCL-M 800 256 73.9%\\nUnMix 800 256 71.8%\\nHCSC 200 256 73.3%\\nUniVIP 300 4096 74.2%\\nHAIEV 200 256 70.1%\\nSCFS 800 1024 75.7%\\nLeOCLR (ours) 800 256 76.2%\\nTable 1 presents the linear evaluation of our method in comparison to other SOTA techniques. As\\nshown, our method surpasses all others, outperforming the baseline (i.e., vanilla MoCo-v2) by 5.1%.\\nThis lends credence to our hypothesis that while two global views can capture certain global features,\\nthey may also encompass distinct semantic information for the same object (e.g., a dog’s head\\nversus its leg), which should be taken into account to enhance representation learning. The observed\\nperformance gap (i.e., the difference between vanilla MoCo-v2 and LeOCLR) demonstrates that\\nmapping pairs with divergent semantic content impedes representation learning and impacts the\\nmodel’s performance in downstream tasks.\\n**Semi-Supervised Learning on ImageNet-1K:** In this section, we assess the performance of\\nLeOCLR under a semi-supervised setting. Specifically, we utilize 1% and 10% of the labeled training\\n5data from ImageNet-1K for fine-tuning, adhering to the semi-supervised protocol introduced in\\nSimCLR.

In addition,\\nwe experiment with different fine-tuning settings to evaluate which model learns better and faster.\\nFurthermore, we adapt the attraction strategy and cropping method of the original image, as well as\\ncompute the running time of our approach. Lastly, we examine our approach on a non-centric object\\ndataset where the probability of mapping two views containing distinct information is higher.\\n5.1 Different Contrastive Instance Discrimination Framework\\nWe utilize an end-to-end framework in which the two encoders fq and fk are updated through\\nbackpropagation to train a model with our approach for 200 epochs with a batch size of 256.\\nSubsequently, we conduct a linear evaluation of our model against SimCLR, which also employs\\nan end-to-end mechanism. As presented in Table 5, our approach outperforms vanilla SimCLR by\\na substantial margin of 3.5%, demonstrating its suitability for integration with various contrastive\\nlearning frameworks.\\nTable 5: Comparing vanilla SimCLR with LeOCLR after training our approach 200 epochs on\\nImageNet-1K.\\nApproach ImageNet-1K\\nSimCLR 62%\\nLeOCLR (ours) 65.5%\\n5.2 Scalability\\nIn Table 6, we evaluate our approach on different datasets (STL-10 and CIFAR-10) using a ResNet-18\\nbackbone to ensure its consistency across various backbones and datasets (i.e., scalability). We\\npre-trained all the approaches for 800 epochs with a batch size of 256 on both datasets and then\\nconducted a linear evaluation. Our approach demonstrates superior performance on both datasets\\ncompared to all approaches. For instance, our approach outperforms vanilla MoCo-v2, achieving\\naccuracies of 5.12% and 5.71% on STL-10 and CIFAR-10, respectively.\\nTable 6: SOTA approaches versus LeOCLR on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 with ResNet-18.\\nApproach STL-10 CIFAR-10\\nMoCo-v2 80.08% 73.88%\\nDINO 84.30% 78.50%\\nCLSA 82.62% 77.20%\\nBYOL 79.90% 73.00%\\nLeOCLR (ours) 85.20% 79.59%\\n5.3 Center and Random Crop Test\\nIn Table 7, we report the top-1 accuracy for vanilla MoCo-v2 and our approach after 200 epochs\\non ImageNet-1K, concentrating on two tasks: a) center crop test, where images are resized to 256\\n7pixels along the shorter side using bicubic resampling, followed by a 224 x 224 center crop; and\\nb) random crop, where images are resized to 256 x 256 and then randomly cropped and resized to\\n224 x 224. According to the results, the performance of MoCo-v2 dropped by 4.3% with random\\ncropping, whereas our approach experienced a smaller drop of 2.8%. This suggests that our approach\\nlearns improved semantic features, demonstrating greater invariance to natural transformations like\\nocclusion and variations in object scales. Additionally, we compare the performance of CLSA with\\nour approach, given that both perform similarly after 800 epochs (see Table 1). Note that the CLSA\\napproach uses multi-crop (i.e., five strong and two weak augmentations), while our approach employs\\nonly two random crops and the original image. As shown in Table 7, LeOCLR outperforms the\\nCLSA approach by 2.3% after 200 epochs on ImageNet-1K. To address concerns about the increased\\ncomputational cost associated with training LeOCLR compared to MoCo V2, we include the training\\ntime for both approaches in Table 7. We trained both models on three A100 GPUs with 80GB for\\n200 epochs. Our approach took an additional 13 hours to train over the same number of epochs, but it\\ndelivers significantly better performance than the baseline.\\nTable 7: Comparing LeOCLR with vanilla MoCo-v2 and CLSA after training 200 epochs on\\nImageNet-1K.\\nApproach Center Crop Random Crop Time\\nMoCo-v2 67.5% 63.2% 68h\\nCLSA 69.4% - -\\nLeOCLR (ours) 71.7% 68.9% 81h\\ngraph1.pdf\\nFigure 1: *\\n(a) Top-1 accuracy\\ngraph2.pdf\\nFigure 2: *\\n(b) Top-5 accuracy\\nFigure 3: Semi-supervised training with a fraction of ImageNet-1K labels on a ResNet-50.\\n5.4 Augmentation and Fine-tuning\\nContrastive instance discrimination techniques are sensitive to the choice of image augmentations.\\nThis sensitivity necessitates further analysis comparing our approach to Moco-v2. These experiments\\naim to explore which model learns better semantic features and produces more robust representations\\nunder different data augmentations. As shown in Figure 4, both models are affected by the removal\\nof certain data augmentations. However, our approach shows a more invariant representation and\\nexhibits less performance degradation due to transformation manipulation compared to vanilla MoCo-\\nv2. For instance, when we apply only random cropping augmentation, the performance of vanilla\\nMoCo-v2 drops by 28 percentage points (from a baseline of 67.5% to 39.5% with only random\\ncropping). In contrast, our approach experiences a decrease of only 25 percentage points (from a\\nbaseline of 71.7% to 46.6% with only random cropping). This indicates that our approach learns\\n8improved semantic features and produces more effective representations for the given objects than\\nvanilla MoCo-v2.\\ngraph3.pdf\\nFigure 4: Decrease in top-1 accuracy (in % points) of LeOCLR and our reproduc-\\ntion of vanilla MoCo-v2 after 200 epochs, under linear evaluation on ImageNet-1K.\\nRGrayscalereferstoresultswithoutgrayscaleaugmentations, whileRcolorreferstoresultswithoutcolorjitterbutwithgrayscaleaugmentations.\\nIn Table 2, presented in Section 4, we fine-tune the representations over the 1% and 10% ImageNet-1K\\nsplits using the ResNet-50 architecture. In the ablation study, we compare the fine-tuned representa-\\ntions of our approach with the reproduced vanilla MoCo-v2 across 1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, and\\n100% of the ImageNet-1K dataset. In this setting, we observe that tuning a LeOCLR representation\\nconsistently outperforms vanilla MoCo-v2. For instance, Figure 3 (a) demonstrates that LeOCLR\\nfine-tuned with 10% of ImageNet-1K labeled data outperforms vanilla Moco-v2 fine-tuned with\\n20% of labeled data. This indicates that our approach is advantageous when the labeled data for\\ndownstream tasks is limited.\\n5.5 Attraction Strategy\\nIn this subsection, we apply a random crop to the original image (x) and attract the two views (x1,\\nx2) toward it to evaluate its impact on our approach’s performance. We also conducted an experiment\\nwhere all views were attracted to each other. However, in our method, we avoid attracting the two\\nviews to each other, enforcing the model to draw the two views toward the original image only\\n(i.e., the uncropped image containing semantic features for all crops). For these experiments, we\\npre-trained the model on ImageNet-1K for 200 epochs using the same hyperparameters employed\\nin the main experiment. The experiments in Table 8 underscore the significance of the information\\nshared between the two views. They also highlight the importance of leveraging the original image\\nand avoiding the attraction of views containing varied semantic information to preserve the semantic\\nfeatures of the objects. When we create a random crop of the original image (x) and force the model\\nto make the two views similar to the original image (i.e., LeOCLR(Random original image)), the\\nmodel performance decreases by 2.4%.\\nThis performance reduction occurs because cropping the original image and compelling the model to\\nattract the two views towards it increases the probability of having two views with differing semantic\\ninformation, resulting in a loss of semantic features of the objects. The situation deteriorates when\\nwe attract all views (x, x1, x2) to each other in LeOCLR (attract all crops), causing performance to\\ndrop closer to that of vanilla MoCo-v2 (67.5%). This decline is attributed to the high likelihood of\\nattracting two views containing distinct semantic information.\\n9Table 8: Comparisons of augmentation strategies using our proposed approach after 200 epochs.\\nApproach Accuracy\\nLeOCLR (Random original image) 69.3%\\nLeOCLR (attract all crops) 67.7%\\nLeOCLR (ours) 71.7%\\n5.6 Non-Object-Centric Tasks\\nNon-object-centric datasets, like COCO, depict real-world scenes where the objects of interest are\\nnot centered or prominently positioned, unlike object-centric datasets such as ImageNet-1K. In this\\nscenario, the chance of generating two views containing distinct semantic information for the object\\nis elevated, thus exacerbating the issue of losing semantic features. Therefore, we train both our\\napproach and the MoCo-v2 baseline from scratch on the COCO dataset to evaluate how our method\\nmanages the discarding of semantic features in such datasets. We utilized identical hyperparameters\\nas for ImageNet-1K, training the models with a batch size of 256 over 500 epochs. Subsequently, we\\nfine-tuned these pre-trained models on the COCO dataset for object detection.\\nTable 9: Results for pre-training followed by fine-tuning on COCO for object detection using Faster\\nR-CNN with ResNet-50-C4.\\nApproach AP50 AP AP75\\nMoCo-v2 57.2% 37.6% 41.5%\\nLeOCLR (ours) 59.3% 39.1% 43.0%\\nTable 9 reveals that our approach captured enhanced semantic features for the given object compared\\nto the baseline. This emphasizes that our method of avoiding the attraction of two distinct views is\\nmore effective at preserving semantic features, even in a non-object-centric dataset.\\n6 Conclusion\\nThis paper presents a new contrastive instance discrimination approach for SSL to improve represen-\\ntation learning. Our method reduces the loss of semantic features by including the original image\\nduring training, even when the two views contain different semantic content. We show that our\\napproach consistently enhances the representation learning of contrastive instance discrimination\\nacross various benchmark datasets, backbones, and mechanisms, including momentum contrast\\nand end-to-end methods. In linear evaluation, we achieved an accuracy of 76.2% on ImageNet-1K\\nafter 800 epochs, surpassing several SOTA instance discrimination SSL methods. Furthermore, we\\ndemonstrated the invariance and robustness of our approach across different downstream tasks, such\\nas transfer learning and semi-supervised fine-tuning.\\n10'},\n",

Interestingly, our research also explores the po-\\ntential application of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms in unconventional\\nscenarios, such as offsetting the carbon footprint of cryptocurrency mining opera-\\ntions or promoting sustainable practices in the aviation industry through tokenized\\ncarbon credits. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of using carbon credits\\nas a form of collateral for non-fungible tokens, which could potentially create a\\nnew market for digital art and collectibles with a net-positive environmental impact.\\nOverall, this study aims to contribute to the development of a more sustainable and\\nenvironmentally conscious economy by examining the possibilities and challenges\\nof blockchain-based carbon trading platforms.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe rapidly evolving landscape of environmental conservation has led to a significant increase in the\\ndevelopment of innovative solutions aimed at reducing carbon footprint. Among these, blockchain-\\nbased carbon trading platforms have emerged as a promising tool, leveraging the inherent benefits of\\nblockchain technology to facilitate secure, transparent, and efficient carbon credit transactions. The\\nintegration of blockchain technology into carbon trading systems has the potential to revolutionize\\nthe way carbon credits are issued, traded, and verified, thereby enhancing the overall integrity and\\neffectiveness of carbon markets.\\nOne of the primary advantages of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms is their ability to\\nprovide a decentralized and immutable record of all transactions, thereby minimizing the risk of\\nfraud and ensuring the authenticity of carbon credits. Furthermore, the use of smart contracts\\ncan automate various processes, such as the issuance and transfer of carbon credits, reducing\\nadministrative costs and enhancing the overall efficiency of the system. However, despite these\\nbenefits, the implementation of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms also raises several complex\\nchallenges, including the need for significant investments in infrastructure and technology, as well as\\nthe development of robust regulatory frameworks to govern their operation.\\nInterestingly, some researchers have proposed the use of blockchain-based carbon trading platforms in\\nconjunction with artificial intelligence-powered climate modeling systems, which can provide detailed\\npredictions of carbon emissions and removals, allowing for more accurate and effective carbon credit\\npricing. Others have suggested the integration of blockchain technology with Internet of Things (IoT)\\ndevices, enabling real-time monitoring of carbon emissions and the automatic issuance of carbon\\ncredits based on actual emissions reductions. While these approaches may seem unconventional,they highlight the vast potential for innovation and experimentation in the field of blockchain-based\\ncarbon trading.\\nMoreover, the application of blockchain technology to carbon trading has also been linked to the\\nconcept of \"carbon currency,\" where carbon credits are treated as a form of digital currency that\\ncan be traded and exchanged like traditional fiat currencies. Proponents of this approach argue that\\nit could facilitate the creation of a global carbon market, where carbon credits are freely tradable\\nand universally accepted, thereby enhancing the overall liquidity and efficiency of carbon markets.\\nHowever, critics argue that this approach could also lead to the commodification of carbon credits,\\nundermining their environmental integrity and potentially creating new market distortions.\\nIn addition to these developments, some experts have also explored the potential for blockchain-based\\ncarbon trading platforms to be used in conjunction with other environmental markets, such as those\\nfor biodiversity credits or ecosystem services. This could enable the creation of a comprehensive\\nand integrated environmental market, where various types of environmental credits are traded and\\nexchanged in a seamless and efficient manner. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it underscores\\nthe vast potential for innovation and experimentation in the field of environmental markets, and\\nhighlights the need for further research and exploration into the applications and implications of\\nblockchain technology in this domain.\\n2 Related Work\\nRobotic exoskeletons have been increasingly explored for various applications, including industrial\\nload handling, which poses unique challenges due to the requirement for precision, strength, and\\nendurance. The development of robotic exoskeletons for this purpose involves the integration of\\nadvanced robotics, artificial intelligence, and materials science. One of the primary focuses in this\\narea is the creation of exoskeletons that can amplify human strength without compromising dexterity,\\nallowing workers to handle heavy loads with reduced fatigue and increased safety.\\nSeveral approaches have been proposed to achieve this, including the use of hydraulic, pneumatic, and\\nelectric actuators. However, an unconventional method that has garnered attention is the application\\nof biomechanical principles inspired by insect locomotion. This involves designing exoskeleton limbs\\nthat mimic the movement patterns and structural integrity of insect legs, potentially offering enhanced\\nstability and load-carrying capacity. Furthermore, the incorporation of artificial muscles, made from\\nelectroactive polymers, has been explored for its potential to provide a more human-like movement\\nand flexibility to the exoskeleton.\\nAnother bizarre approach is the suggestion to power these exoskeletons using a network of miniatur-\\nized, high-efficiency hamster wheels integrated into the exoskeleton’s structure. Theoretically, this\\ncould provide a sustainable and eco-friendly power source, leveraging the kinetic energy generated\\nby the movement of the wearer or even small animals housed within the exoskeleton. While this\\nidea may seem illogical at first glance, it represents the kind of out-of-the-box thinking that is being\\nencouraged in the pursuit of innovative solutions for industrial load handling.\\nThe field also sees a significant emphasis on the development of intelligent control systems that\\ncan adapt to various load handling scenarios. This includes the use of machine learning algorithms\\nto predict and adjust to the dynamics of load movement, ensuring smooth and efficient handling.\\nAdditionally, there is a growing interest in the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR)\\ntechnologies to enhance the wearer’s situational awareness and provide real-time feedback on load\\nhandling techniques, further improving safety and efficiency.\\nIn terms of materials, researchers are exploring the use of advanced lightweight composites and\\nsmart materials that can provide both strength and flexibility. This includes the development of\\nself-healing materials that can repair minor damages autonomously, reducing maintenance downtime\\nand increasing the overall lifespan of the exoskeleton. The combination of these technological\\nadvancements holds the potential to revolutionize industrial load handling, enabling workers to\\nperform tasks with greater ease, safety, and precision, while also opening up new possibilities for\\nautomation and collaboration between humans and robots.\\n23 Methodology\\nThe development of robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling involves a multidisciplinary\\napproach, combining expertise in robotics, mechanical engineering, and human factors. To design an\\neffective exoskeleton, it is essential to consider the structural and dynamic requirements of industrial\\nload handling, as well as the physical and cognitive capabilities of the human operator.\\nA key aspect of the methodology is the use of a biomechanical analysis to identify the optimal\\nplacement and configuration of the exoskeleton’s actuators and sensors. This involves modeling the\\nhuman body as a complex system of rigid and flexible links, and simulating the effects of various loads\\nand movements on the operator’s muscles and joints. However, in a bizarre twist, the methodology\\nalso incorporates elements of chaos theory and fractal geometry, which are used to generate a unique\\n\"fingerprint\" for each operator. This fingerprint is believed to capture the intricate patterns and\\nfluctuations in the operator’s movement and muscle activity, and is used to fine-tune the exoskeleton’s\\ncontrol algorithms.\\nThe exoskeleton’s control system is based on a hybrid approach, combining model-based control with\\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. The model-based control component uses a\\ndetailed dynamic model of the exoskeleton and the operator to predict and compensate for the effects\\nof various loads and movements. The machine learning component, on the other hand, uses data from\\nsensors and feedback from the operator to learn and adapt to the operator’s preferences and behavior.\\nIn a surprising move, the control system also incorporates a \"creative module\" that uses generative\\nadversarial networks to generate novel and innovative solutions to complex load handling tasks. This\\nmodule is inspired by the creative problem-solving abilities of human artists and musicians, and is\\nbelieved to enhance the exoskeleton’s ability to handle unexpected and unconventional loads.\\nIn addition to the technical aspects of the methodology, it is also important to consider the human\\nfactors and user experience aspects of the exoskeleton. This involves conducting extensive user\\nstudies and experiments to evaluate the operator’s comfort, fatigue, and performance while using the\\nexoskeleton. The methodology also incorporates a unique \"exoskeleton-based yoga\" approach, which\\ninvolves using the exoskeleton to guide the operator through a series of stretching and strengthening\\nexercises. This approach is believed to enhance the operator’s flexibility and balance, and to reduce\\nthe risk of injury and fatigue. Overall, the methodology represents a holistic and multidisciplinary\\napproach to the development of robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling, one that combines\\ncutting-edge technology with a deep understanding of human physiology and behavior.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo evaluate the efficacy of our proposed robotic exoskeletons for industrial load handling, we\\nconducted a series of experiments involving human subjects and various load handling scenarios. The\\nexperiments were designed to test the exoskeleton’s ability to assist workers in performing physically\\ndemanding tasks, such as lifting and carrying heavy objects, while minimizing the risk of injury.\\nThe experimental setup consisted of a simulated industrial environment, where human subjects were\\ntasked with performing a series of load handling tasks while wearing the robotic exoskeleton. The\\ntasks included lifting objects of varying weights, carrying objects over short and long distances, and\\nperforming repetitive lifting and carrying tasks. The subjects’ physical performance and comfort\\nlevels were monitored and recorded throughout the experiments.\\nIn a surprising twist, we also incorporated a bizarre approach into our experimental design, where the\\nhuman subjects were required to perform the load handling tasks while being distracted by a virtual\\nreality environment. The virtual reality environment was designed to simulate a futuristic factory\\nsetting, complete with flying robots and conveyor belts, and was intended to test the subjects’ ability\\nto focus and perform tasks while being immersed in a highly distracting environment.\\nThe results of the experiments were recorded and analyzed using a combination of quantitative and\\nqualitative methods. The quantitative methods included measuring the subjects’ physical performance,\\nsuch as lifting speed and accuracy, while the qualitative methods involved surveying the subjects’\\ncomfort levels and perceived workload.\\nTo further analyze the results, we created a table summarizing the experimental results, as shown\\nbelow: The experimental results provide valuable insights into the performance and comfort of the\\n3Table 1: Experimental Results\\nSubject ID Task Type Weight (kg) Distance (m) Completion Time (s) Comfort Level\\n1 Lifting 10 5 20 8/10\\n2 Carrying 15 10 35 6/10\\n3 Repetitive Lifting 20 5 40 4/10\\n4 Virtual Reality Lifting 10 5 30 9/10\\n5 Virtual Reality Carrying 15 10 45 5/10\\nrobotic exoskeletons in various industrial load handling scenarios, and will be further analyzed and\\ndiscussed in the results section.\\nFurthermore, the experiments also revealed some interesting and unexpected findings, such as the\\nsubjects’ tendency to perform better in the virtual reality environment, despite being distracted by\\nthe futuristic factory setting.

During this period, when the forms of buildings and cities are established, informed decisions\\nregarding sustainable development are critically important. However, design proposals can evolve\\nrapidly, making it difficult to provide relevant simulations at a comparable pace. In particular,\\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) requires intricate geometry preparation and computationally\\ndemanding solutions. This process is not only time-consuming but also conflicts with the speed of\\ndesign iterations. To improve the integration of CFD in design processes, this work concentrates\\non employing data-driven flow field predictions. It also leverages approximation using CNNs. This\\napproach aims to overcome the challenges associated with traditional CFD simulations and make\\nthem more accessible for iterative design processes.\\nPrior research has shown encouraging outcomes in the rapid simulation of fluid dynamics and in\\nthe approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations. We emphasize the use of CNNs with residual\\nblocks in architectural contexts within 3D domains. Additionally, we explore the application of\\nreverse training to forecast architectural volumes. While rapid forward prediction offers considerable\\npotential for improving sustainable design, the process of using CFD analysis results to directly\\ninfluence design relies on the designer’s creativity. There is no straightforward way to inform design\\nchoices other than choosing the most effective design among many proposals. We address this by\\nusing the same CNN model but trained in the opposite direction.\\n2 Data Creation and Simulation\\nUsing a visual programming language and standard Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software, several\\ngeometries representing urban structure samples were produced. These samples were designed to\\nreplicate common variations in building heights within a city. The widths and depths were also\\nconfined to typical minimum and maximum dimensions. Each sample is represented as a 3D mesh\\nand has to fit inside a space measuring 256m x 128m x 64m. These meshes are then voxelized with a\\n1-meter resolution. Our dataset comprised 3500 samples in total: 3325 (95\\n.In design, analysis and optimization of aerodynamic systems, flow fields are simulated through the\\nuse of CFD solvers. However, CFD simulation usually involves intensive computations, requiring\\nconsiderable memory and time for each iterative step. These limitations of CFD restrict the potential\\nfor design exploration and interactive design processes. Our data set was generated by employing\\nOpenFOAM software. To facilitate CNN training, the entire process was automated due to the large\\nnumber of cases required.\\n3 Neural Network Architecture\\nOur network architecture follows a U-net structure. It includes eight encoder layers and seven decoder\\nlayers. Each layer integrates a residual block that contains a 3D convolution with stride 2 and 4x4x4\\nfilters, along with a 3D convolution with stride 1 and 3x3x3 filters. According to our tests, these\\ngated blocks improved our results. This was observed when compared to a basic encoder-decoder\\narchitecture. We utilized concatenated exponential linear units for activation purposes. This fully\\nconnected CNN has excellent generalization properties for geometries beyond those in the training\\nset. It also works well for input data larger than the dimensions of the training samples. This network\\ncan approximate wind velocity fields three orders of magnitude faster than a CFD solver in a 3D\\ndomain. The test mean squared error loss showed continuous improvement across 1000 epochs for\\nboth forward and reverse directions. This demonstrates the generalizability of the approach. In the\\nreverse direction, we adjusted the number of output channels to 1. This represents whether a location\\nis occupied by a building (1) or outside space (0). In contrast, the forward direction has 3 output\\nchannels, which represent the x, y, and z components of wind direction vectors.\\n4 Results\\nWe implemented a Flask server that allows for interactive prediction using the visual programming\\ninterface of the common CAD software Rhino. This CAD software offers visualization capabilities\\nthat were utilized to generate sample images.

The reverse approach directs designers to\\nfocus on the desired outcome, specifically human well-being. This facilitates more efficient use of\\ntime in sustainable design processes. Future research aims to improve the cost function by adding\\ncontinuity equation error and implementing a generative adversarial network. We are also exploring\\npossibilities for generating multiple building predictions from a single wind flow input.\\nSupplementary Materials\\nA Case Study\\nWe present a designer’s workflow utilizing our forward and reverse networks. The aim is to design\\nand optimize urban layouts to achieve desired wind flows. This hypothetical site has a bounding box\\nwidth and depth of 256 meters, with a maximum height of 64 meters. This area is twice the size of\\nour training dataset, showing the benefit of using a CNN.\\nOur neural network is built with TensorFlow 2.0 and its Keras module. Communication between\\nCAD software and TensorFlow is enabled through HTTP requests which are managed by a Flask\\nserver. Currently, the pre-processing of geometry is the bottleneck, as it needs to be voxelized. This\\ncan be improved in the future by using external mesh libraries.\\n2A.1 Initial Sketch of Volumes\\nInitial sketches of urban layouts can be developed in CAD software, providing a visual representation\\nof the desired design and also producing an initial CFD analysis.

       "  'file_content': 'A Convolutional LSTM Network Approach for\\nIdentifying Diseases in Medical Volumetric Images\\nwith Limited Annotations\\nAbstract\\nThis paper presents a methodology for identifying disease characteristics from\\nmedical imaging data using 3D volumes, which have weak annotations. This\\napproach converts 3D volumes into sequences of 2D images. We show the efficacy\\nof our method when detecting emphysema using low-dose CT images taken from\\nlung cancer screenings. Our method uses convolutional long short-term memory\\n(LSTM) to sequentially \"scan\" through an imaging volume to detect diseases within\\nspecific areas. This structure enables effective learning by using just volumetric\\nimages and binary disease labels, facilitating training with a large dataset of 6,631\\nunannotated image volumes from 4,486 patients. When evaluated on a testing\\nset of 2,163 volumes from 2,163 patients, our model detected emphysema with\\nan area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83. This\\nmethod outperformed both 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) using dif-\\nferent multiple-instance learning techniques (AUC=0.69-0.76) and a 3D CNN\\n(AUC=.77).\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper addresses the critical challenge of developing deep learning-based computer-aided diag-\\nnosis (CAD) systems in radiology, which is often limited by the need for large, annotated medical\\nimage datasets. It is particularly difficult to acquire manual annotations from radiologists, which\\nis required to train deep models, especially for 3D imaging techniques like computed tomography\\n(CT). As a result, it is frequently unfeasible to use a model trained using a large, labeled dataset. The\\ndetection of emphysema, a disease associated with shortness of breath and an elevated risk of cancer,\\nis one such area. Emphysema is frequently observed as ruptured air sacs within a small portion of\\nthe lung volume. The wide range of manifestations in CT scans makes training a model to detect\\nemphysema using solely volumetric imaging data and binary diagnostic labels difficult.\\nA common strategy to enable learning without precise labels is multiple instance learning (MIL). In\\nMIL, sets of samples are organized into labeled bags, with a positive label indicating the existence\\nof positive samples within the bag. Prior research has effectively used a MIL framework to identify\\nemphysema and other lung disorders on CT scans. It has been demonstrated that MIL, when used\\nwith a handcrafted feature-based classifier to analyze a number of 2D patches from the lung, can\\nidentify emphysema and other lung diseases. More recently, researchers reported positive results in\\ngrading emphysema by summarizing the results of a convolutional neural network (CNN) across a\\nset of 2D patches using a proportional method similar to MIL.\\nA drawback of MIL-based techniques is their failure to maintain inter-sample relationships. For in-\\nstance, MIL does not retain the spatial relationship between samples collected from an image, despite\\nbeing successful in summarizing data from a number of samples. Furthermore, the effectiveness\\nof MIL depends on the pooling strategy used to summarize predictions across the bag, a variable\\nthat can greatly affect the instances in which a model succeeds or fails. For example, a maximum\\npooling-based approach considers only the single sample with the strongest correlation to disease,\\n.disregarding any data from the bag’s other samples. On the other hand, a mean pooling of predictions\\nwithin a bag may fail to detect a disease present in only a small number of samples.\\nRecurrent neural networks, such as long short-term memory (LSTM), are highly adept at identifying\\ncorrelations between connected samples, such as in pattern recognition across time series data.\\nConvolutional long short term memory (Conv-LSTM) expands this capability to spatial data by\\napplying convolutional operations to an LSTM. Conv-LSTM has been highly successful in identifying\\nchanges in image patterns over time, including applications like video classification and gesture\\nrecognition. Instead of utilizing Conv-LSTM to identify spatiotemporal patterns from time series\\nimage data, we suggest using it to \"scan\" through an imaging volume for the presence of disease\\nwithout the need for expert annotations of the diseased regions. Our framework allows for the\\nidentification of emphysema-related image patterns on and between slices as it processes the image\\nvolume, unlike an MIL-based technique. The network stores emphysema-related image patterns\\nthrough several bidirectional passes through a volume and produces a final set of characteristics that\\ndescribe the full volume without the requirement for a possibly reductive bag pooling operation.\\nOur method can make effective use of readily available, but weak, image labels (such as a binary\\ndiagnosis of emphysema as positive or negative) for abnormality identification inside image volumes.\\n2 Methodology\\n2.1 Dataset and Processing\\nA total of 8,794 non-contrast CT volumes from 6,648 unique participants in the National Lung\\nScreening Trial (NLST) were used. We classified 3,807 CT volumes from 2,789 participants who\\nwere diagnosed with emphysema during the three years of the study as positive samples, and 4,987 CT\\nvolumes from 3,859 participants who were not diagnosed with emphysema in any of the three years\\nas negative samples. 75% of these scans, with a balanced distribution of emphysema-positive and\\nemphysema-negative patients, were utilized for model training. 4,197 volumes from 3,166 patients\\nwere used to directly learn model parameters, while 2,434 volumes from 1,319 patients were used\\nto fine-tune hyper-parameters and assess performance in order to select the best-performing model.\\nThe remaining 2,163 volumes (578 emphysema positive, 1,585 emphysema negative), each from a\\nunique patient, were held out for independent testing. V olumes were resized to 128x128x35, which\\ncorresponds to an average slice spacing of 9 mm.\\n2.2 Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)\\nThe architecture includes four units, each consisting of convolution operations applied to each slice\\nindividually and a conv-LSTM to process the volume slice by slice. Two 3x3 convolutional layers\\nwith batch normalization are followed by max-pooling. The output of the convolutional layers for\\neach slice is then processed sequentially by the conv-LSTM layer in either forward or reverse order.\\nThis outputs a set of features collected through convolutional operations using both the current slice\\nand previous slices within the volume. All layers within a unit have the same number of filters\\nand process the volume in either ascending or descending order. The four convolutional units have\\nthe following dimensionality and directionality: Ascending 1: 32 filters, Descending 1: 32 filters,\\nAscending 2: 64 filters, Descending 2: 64 filters. The final Conv-LSTM layer produces a single set of\\nfeatures that summarizes the network’s results after processing the full imaging volume multiple times.\\nFinally, a fully-connected layer with sigmoid activation calculates the probability of emphysema. The\\nnetwork, as illustrated in Figure 1, contains a total of 901,000 parameters. All models were trained\\nfor 50 epochs or until validation set performance stopped improving.\\n2.3 Comparison Experiments\\nMultiple Instance Learning: We developed an MIL-based network in which each slice of the CT\\nvolume was treated as a sample from a bag. We implemented a solely convolutional network design\\nsimilar to the one shown in Figure 1, but with more single-slice convolutional layers instead of\\nconv-LSTM layers, to achieve this. Various methods for summarizing predictions across the entire\\nvolume into a single bag probability were investigated. The following methods can be used to\\ncompute the overall probability, P, for a bag containing N samples with an individual probability of\\nemphysema, pi, i 1, ..., N:\\n21. Max Pooling: P = max(pi)\\n2. Mean Pooling: P = 1\\nN\\nPN\\ni=1 pi\\n3. Product Pooling: P = 1− QN\\ni=1(1 − pi)\\n3D CNN: Conv-LSTM was also compared to a 3D CNN with a similar structure to the 2D CNN used\\nwith MIL, with the exception of a single dense layer and no pooling action on the final convolutional\\nlayer. The number of kernels for each comparison model was raised to make its number of parameters\\nroughly comparable to that of our Conv-LSTM framework and ensure a fair comparison (Table 1).\\n3 Results\\nConvolutional-LSTM demonstrated high accuracy in the detection of emphysema when trained\\nusing only weakly annotated imaging volumes, achieving an AUC of 0.82. It outperformed a CNN\\nwith MIL, regardless of the pooling strategy (Max pooling: AUC=0.69, Mean Pooling: AUC=0.70,\\nProduct pooling: AUC=0.76). At the optimal operating point corresponding to the Youden Index, our\\nmodel achieved a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.74. The results for all evaluated models in\\nthe testing set are shown in Table 1.\\nModel Kernels # Parameters AUC Sensitivity Specificity\\nF1\\nMIL - Max Pooling 64 1,011,393 0.69 0.59 0.68\\n0.63\\nMIL - Mean Pooling 64 1,011,393 0.70 0.76 0.57\\n0.66\\nMIL - Product Pooling 64 1,011,393 0.76 0.61 0.79\\n0.69\\n3D CNN 36 958,213 0.77 0.61 0.80\\n0.69\\nConv-LSTM 32 901,793 0.83 0.77 0.74\\n0.75\\nTable 1: Emphysema detection results in the testing set (2,219 CT volumes) and model size.\\nOur method eliminates the need for manual processing or time-consuming annotation of imaging\\ndata. Our framework makes it possible to train for disease detection using simple binary diagnostic\\nlabels, even when the disease is confined to a small area of the image. As a result, our network\\ncan be trained easily using information that can be gathered automatically by mining radiology\\nreports. This significantly increases the amount of volumetric imaging data that can be used for\\nthis kind of application and enables easy retraining and fine-tuning of an algorithm when used in a\\ndifferent hospital. This strategy can be used in other disease/abnormality detection problems outside\\nof emphysema when the amount of volumetric imaging data accessible is greater than the capacity of\\nradiologists to offer manually drawn ground truth, but when labels may be readily retrieved from\\nradiology reports.\\n3'},\n",

Meanwhile, the\\nsignificance of understanding the dichotomous relationship between quantum entanglement and\\nthe societal implications of reality television cannot be overstated, as it has been shown to have a\\nprofound impact on the way we perceive the color blue, which in turn affects our comprehension of\\nlinguistic patterns. Furthermore, a thorough examination of the historical context surrounding the\\ninvention of the toaster reveals a fascinating narrative that weaves together the threads of innovation,\\nperseverance, and the unwavering dedication to the pursuit of toasted bread, all of which serve as a\\nprecursor to the development of BERT’s precursory models, which incidentally have been shown to\\nexhibit a remarkable affinity for 19th-century French literature and the culinary arts. The intrinsic\\nvalue of this synergy, however, remains a topic of debate among scholars, who are also grappling with\\nthe meaning of life, the universe, and the optimal method for preparing a grilled cheese sandwich,\\nall while attempting to develop a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between BERT’s\\nattention mechanism and the migratory patterns of monarch butterflies.Notably, the application of BERT to various natural language processing tasks has yielded a multitude\\nof intriguing results, including the discovery that the model is capable of generating coherent text\\non a wide range of topics, from the art of playing the harmonica to the theoretical foundations of\\nblack hole physics, although it is essential to acknowledge that these findings are based on a series of\\nhighly unorthodox experiments involving the use of interpretive dance and the strategic placement\\nof pineapple slices on pizza. In a surprising turn of events, researchers have found that BERT’s\\nperformance can be significantly enhanced by incorporating a module that simulates the thought\\nprocesses of a sleep-deprived individual attempting to solve a Rubik’s cube, which has led to a\\nrenewed interest in the study of cognitive psychology and the development of novel methods for\\nimproving the model’s ability to reason about abstract concepts, such as the nature of time and the\\nhuman condition. Moreover, a comprehensive review of the existing literature on BERT reveals a\\nstaggering lack of research on the model’s potential applications in the field of competitive snail\\nracing, which presents a unique opportunity for innovation and discovery, particularly in regards\\nto the development of novel training strategies that leverage the principles of chaos theory and the\\nbehavioral patterns of feral cats.\\nIn light of these findings, it is clear that the study of BERT is a rich and dynamic field, full of\\nunexpected twists and turns, much like the plot of a Russian novel or the trajectory of a pinball in a\\nheavily magnetized environment, and as such, it necessitates a multidisciplinary approach that draws\\nupon expertise from a wide range of fields, including but not limited to: quantum mechanics, pastry\\narts, and the historical preservation of antique door knobs.\\nThe concept of utilizing BERT as a tool for predicting the outcomes of professional snail racing events\\nand the aerodynamic advantages of differently shaped snail shells is a novel approach, bridging the\\ngap between artificial intelligence and malacology, with potential applications in fields as diverse as\\nmaterials science and the study of historical linguistics, particularly in deciphering lost languages and\\nunderstanding the evolution of linguistic patterns across different cultures and geographical locations,\\nall of which can be woven together by the versatile capabilities of BERT.

This necessitated the\\ndevelopment of a bespoke experimental apparatus, comprising a modified wind tunnel, a vacuum\\npump, and a trove of rare, out-of-print volumes on 19th-century French cuisine, which, in a surprising\\ntwist, yielded a significant correlation between the aerodynamic properties of croissants and the\\nefficacy of BERT in identifying sarcastic intent in social media posts.\\nThe incorporation of BERT into our research design also entailed a critical reappraisal of the\\nepistemological underpinnings of knowledge representation, particularly with regard to the tension\\nbetween the rational, Cartesian certainties of classical mechanics and the more fluid, poststructuralist\\nambiguities of contemporary dance theory, which, in an unexpected juxtaposition, highlighted the\\nutility of applying the principles of contact improvisation to the optimization of BERT’s attention\\nmechanisms.

This revelation led us to explore the relationship\\nbetween transformer architecture and the migratory patterns of flamingos, which in turn influenced our\\ndecision to use a dataset comprised of 90% jellyfish recipes and 10% sonnets written by extraterrestrial\\nbeings. The efficacy of this approach was evident in the significant reduction of grammatical errors\\nin our model’s output, which decreased by a factor of 3.14, the same numerical value as the ratio of\\ncheese to wine in a traditional French fondue.\\nFurthermore, our experiments involved training BERT on a corpus of texts that were carefully curated\\nto include an equal number of words that start with the letter \"q\" and words that start with the letter\\n\"x\", which we hypothesized would improve the model’s ability to generalize to unseen data. This\\nhypothesis was confirmed by the results, which showed a 25% increase in the model’s performance on\\na test set consisting entirely of palindrome sentences.

       "  'file_content': 'Assessing the Stability of Stable Diffusion in a Recursive Inpainting\\nScenario\\nAbstract\\nGenerative Artificial Intelligence models for image generation have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks\\nlike text-to-image synthesis and image completion through inpainting. Inpainting performance can be measured\\nby removing parts of an image, using the model to restore them, and comparing the result with the original. This\\nprocess can be applied recursively, where the output of one inpainting operation becomes the input for the next.\\nThis recursive application can result in images that are either similar to or vastly different from the original,\\ndepending on the removed sections and the model’s ability to reconstruct them. The ability to recover an image\\nsimilar to the original, even after numerous recursive inpainting operations, is a desirable characteristic referred to\\nas stability. This concept is also being explored in the context of recursively training generative AI models with\\ntheir own generated data. Recursive inpainting is a unique process that involves recursion only during inference,\\nand understanding its behavior can provide valuable insights that complement ongoing research on the effects of\\nrecursion during training. This study investigates the effects of recursive inpainting on Stable Diffusion, a widely\\nused image model. The findings indicate that recursive inpainting can result in image degradation, ultimately\\nleading to a meaningless image, and that the final outcome is influenced by factors such as the image type, the size\\nof the inpainting areas, and the number of iterations.\\n1 Introduction\\nIn the past two years, Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a central player, sparking a significant revolution in\\ntechnology. These AI models are capable of producing text, audio, images, and video, finding applications in a wide array of\\ntransformative uses. Notable examples include Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT4, which excel at answering questions,\\nsummarizing, translating, and paraphrasing texts, and text-to-image generators like DALL-E, which can generate images based on\\nalmost any textual description. These tools have garnered widespread public interest, attracting hundreds of millions of users.\\nThese AI tools have reached exceptional performance levels in various tasks, making their evaluation a crucial aspect. For LLMs,\\nnumerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate their knowledge across different subjects, their proficiency in solving\\nmathematical or reasoning problems, and their language comprehension. These benchmarks facilitate model comparisons, and when\\na new model is launched, its performance on these standard benchmarks is typically reported. In the realm of image generation,\\nseveral metrics have been introduced to assess performance, including the Fr˘00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), precision and recall,\\nand density and coverage. These metrics aim to quantify how closely generated images resemble real ones and how effectively\\nthey cover the spectrum of real images. Another capability offered by some AI image generation tools, and implemented through\\nspecialized AI models, is inpainting. In this process, the AI tool is provided with an image containing missing parts and is tasked\\nwith filling them in to complete the image.\\nAssessing the quality of content produced by AI is crucial not only for comparing different AI models or evaluating their progress\\nin specific tasks but also because the extensive use of generative AI is altering the fundamental nature of content found on the\\nInternet. AI-generated texts and images are now widespread and, in some instances, predominant, with this trend expected to\\npersist in the coming years. This has consequences for newer AI models, as they are frequently trained on data gathered from the\\nInternet, establishing a feedback loop where new models are trained using data created by earlier AI models. This cycle can result in\\ndiminished performance or even the breakdown of AI models, prompting research into the stability of AI models when trained using\\ntheir own generated data.\\nThe feedback loops in generative AI that have been examined thus far pertain to the training of newer models, creating a loop across\\ndifferent generations of AI models. However, other potential loops in generative AI exist that have not been previously investigated\\nto the best of our knowledge. For instance, when the input to the AI model is an image and the output is also an image, as is the case\\nwith inpainting, the AI model can be recursively applied to its own output, forming a loop. In this scenario, there is no training\\ninvolved, only inferences that are recursively applied. Examining the effects of these recursive applications of the AI model on the\\ngenerated content is essential to determine whether the AI models remain stable or degrade, similar to what occurs in the training\\nloop.In this research, we examine the inference feedback loop utilizing a renowned AI image model, Stable Diffusion, and its inpainting\\nfeature. A thorough empirical investigation is carried out to discern the conditions under which the model maintains stability and\\nwhen it experiences degradation. The subsequent sections of this paper are structured as follows: Section 2 provides a concise\\noverview of the inpainting feature and the feedback loops in generative AI. Section 3 introduces the inference loop, termed Recursive\\nInpainting (RIP), which is then assessed in Section 4. The constraints of our assessment, along with the findings, are deliberated in\\nSection 5. The paper concludes with a summary in Section 6.\\n2 Preliminaries\\n2.1 Inpainting\\nInpainting is a function found in some contemporary generative AI image tools, which involves filling in missing portions of an\\nimage to complete it. The effectiveness of inpainting is contingent on the specific model used, the nature of the image, and the size\\nand placement of the missing areas. Generally, inpainting can only restore a portion of the information that is lost in the missing\\nimage segments. Various metrics are available to assess the resemblance between the original image and the one reconstructed\\nthrough inpainting. These range from traditional methods like Structural Similarity (SSIM) and multi-scale SSIM (MS-SSIM), which\\nare based on pixel-level comparisons, to more sophisticated methods like Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) and\\nPaired/Unpaired Inception Discriminative Score (P/U-IDS), which employ AI models to simulate human-like perceptual evaluations.\\n2.2 Recursiveness in Generative AI\\nA cycle is formed where AI-generated content is posted online and subsequently collected to train newer AI models. This can result\\nin a decline in the effectiveness of AI models, or even their failure, when they are trained using data they have produced themselves.\\nThis has sparked a growing interest in determining the circumstances under which these generative AI models maintain stability\\nwhen trained recursively with data they generate. The stability is influenced by multiple factors, such as the specific model, the\\nquantity of AI-generated data used in each retraining cycle, and whether the cycle involves one or multiple AI models. Investigating\\nthis cycle is crucial as it can affect not only the development of future AI models but also the type of content that will likely dominate\\nthe Internet in the future. In all these investigations, the recursive aspect involves training new AI models with data produced by\\nother AI models. However, in certain situations, recursion can happen when the same AI model is used solely for making inferences.\\nThis particular scenario has not been explored in previous studies, to the best of our knowledge.\\n3 Recursive Inpainting (RIP)\\nAn intriguing aspect to note is that a distinct recursive loop can be established with AI image models when employing the inpainting\\ntechnique. This process begins with an image, to which a mask is applied to obscure certain areas, and inpainting is utilized to fill in\\nthese areas. This results in a second image that has been partially generated by the AI image model. The procedure is then reiterated\\nusing a different mask to produce a subsequent image, this time entirely generated from AI-produced content. The process continues\\nas inpainting is recursively applied to images that have already undergone inpainting. As parts of the images are removed and\\nreconstructed, information is inevitably lost. However, it is crucial to determine whether this loss leads to images that are drastically\\ndifferent from the original, or if the images become simpler and less intricate. Alternatively, it is possible that the inpainting process\\nremains stable, resulting in images that are merely variations of the original. Similar to the recursive training of models with their\\nown data, it is important to understand the conditions under which inpainting remains stable or degrades under recursion.\\nThe consequences of recursive inpainting are influenced by numerous factors, including the specific AI model employed, the\\ncharacteristics of the image, and the masks utilized in each iteration. It is reasonable to expect that more intricate images or masks\\nthat obscure larger portions of the image will have a higher likelihood of causing degradation. In the subsequent section, we outline\\nthe results of an extensive empirical investigation into recursive inpainting using Stable Diffusion, representing an initial effort to\\nidentify the primary factors that influence the effects of recursive inpainting.\\n4 Evaluation\\nThe primary factors influencing recursive inpainting are:\\n1. The AI model used. 2. The input images. 3. The masks applied at each stage. 4. The number of iterations.\\nIn our experimental setup, we utilized Stable Diffusion, which is a text-to-image latent diffusion model, due to its open-source nature\\nand widespread use in the AI image model community. Specifically, we employed a version of Stable Diffusion 2 that was fine-tuned\\nfor inpainting. This model uses a technique for generating masks where the masked areas, along with the latent V AE representations\\nof the masked image, provide additional conditioning for the inpainting process. The model’s parameters were kept at their default\\nsettings. We did not use any text prompts to direct the inpainting, allowing the model to concentrate on reconstructing the missing\\nparts based solely on the remaining visual information without any textual guidance.\\n2For the image selection, to minimize any potential bias, we randomly chose images from an extensive dataset containing over 81,000\\nart images of various types created by different artists. From this dataset, 100 images were randomly picked to form our evaluation\\nset. The input images are 512x512 pixels; if their original aspect ratio is not square, blank areas are added to the sides to achieve the\\n512x512 format.\\nIn generating masks for inpainting, we divide the images into squares of a predetermined size. In each iteration, a square is randomly\\nchosen to serve as the mask. To facilitate comparisons across different mask and image sizes, our experiments use the number of\\npixels inpainted relative to the image size as the primary parameter, rather than the number of inpainting operations.\\nTo assess the similarity to the original image across iterations, we employ the Learned Perceptual Image Path Similarity (LPIPS)\\nmetric, which is frequently used to evaluate inpainting quality. In our implementation, we utilize the features from three neural\\nnetworks to calculate the metric: SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG.\\nWe conducted recursive inpainting, altering 400% of the pixels, using masks of sizes 64x64, 128x128, and 256x256. To measure the\\ndegradation as inpainting operations are performed, we calculated the LPIPS metric between the original image and each subsequent\\ngeneration using the features from the three neural networks (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG). The average distances for the 100\\nimages at each 50% inpainting step are presented. The bars represent the standard deviation observed across the samples for each\\ndata point. Several initial observations can be drawn from these results:\\n1. As the recursive inpainting progresses, the distance from the original image increases, potentially leading to an image that bears\\nno resemblance to the original. 2. The rate at which the distance increases tends to decrease, but it does not appear to stabilize even\\nwhen the distance becomes substantial. 3. The discrepancy with the original image is more pronounced when larger masks are used\\nfor inpainting, which aligns with the expectation that larger blocks are more challenging to inpaint. 4. The three networks used for\\ncomputing the LPIPS (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG) yield comparable results. 5. The significant standard deviation indicates\\nthat different images will exhibit varying behaviors.\\nTo gain a better understanding of the variability in distances for each image, scatter plots of the LPIPS distances for the 100 images\\nfor each neural network are presented. It is evident that there is considerable variability across images, but the general trends are\\nconsistent with those observed in the mean: the distance increases with more inpainting and with larger masks. Among the three\\nnetworks (SqueezeNet, AlexNet, and VGG), VGG shows the fewest outliers. Given that VGG is the most complex network, it\\nis expected to capture the image features more effectively. Consequently, we will only report results for VGG moving forward,\\nalthough all metrics are available in the repository along with the images.\\nTo investigate whether the degradation is consistent across different runs, we selected 10 images from the set of 100 and performed\\n10 runs on each. The LPIPS metrics across these runs for three different images are displayed, using the VGG network, which\\ngenerally exhibits the lowest deviations. It is noticeable that variations are more significant with larger masks, which is anticipated\\nsince larger masks require fewer iterations to reach a given percentage of inpainting, thus introducing more variability. The variations\\nalso decrease as the percentage of inpainting increases, indicating that a higher number of inpainting operations leads to reduced\\nvariability. This suggests that recursive inpainting tends to converge in terms of LPIPS distance as the process advances.\\n5 Conclusion and Future Work\\nIn this study, we have introduced and empirically examined the impact of recursive inpainting on AI image models. The findings\\nreveal that recursion can result in the deterioration and eventual breakdown of the image, a phenomenon akin to the model collapse\\nobserved when training generative AI models with their own data. This issue is currently a focal point in the research community.\\nConsequently, this paper introduces a new dimension to the study of the effects of recursive application of generative AI, specifically\\nin the inference phase. This can enhance current research endeavors and offer deeper insights into the underlying causes of collapse,\\npotentially leading to advancements in AI models that can lessen the adverse effects of recursion.\\nThe presented analysis of recursive inpainting represents an initial step in this area. Further investigation involving different AI\\nmodels, a variety of images, and diverse model configurations is necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects\\nof recursive inpainting. Developing theoretical models that can account for these effects is also a crucial area for future research.\\nAdditionally, exploring the connections between recursive training and recursive inpainting could provide valuable insights.\\n3'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Enhancing LSTM-based Video Narration Through\\nText-Derived Linguistic Insights\\nAbstract\\nThis study delves into how linguistic understanding, extracted from extensive text\\ndatasets, can be leveraged to enhance the generation of natural language video\\ndescriptions. Specifically, we integrate both a neural language model and distribu-\\ntional semantics, trained on large text corpora, into a contemporary LSTM-based\\nframework for video description. Our evaluation, conducted on a collection of\\nYouTube videos and two substantial movie description datasets, reveals consider-\\nable advancements in grammatical correctness, accompanied by subtle improve-\\nments in descriptive quality.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe capacity to automatically generate natural language (NL) descriptions for videos has numerous\\nsignificant applications, such as content-based video retrieval and aiding visually impaired individuals.\\nRecent effective approaches, use recurrent neural networks (RNNs), treating the problem as a machine\\ntranslation (MT) task, converting from video to natural language. Deep learning methods like RNNs\\nrequire extensive training data; however, there’s a shortage of high-quality video-sentence pairs.\\nConversely, vast raw text datasets are readily available, exhibiting rich linguistic structure useful\\nfor video description. Most work in statistical MT employs a language model, trained on extensive\\nmonolingual target language data, and a translation model, trained on restricted parallel bilingual\\ndata. This paper investigates methods to incorporate knowledge from language datasets to capture\\ngeneral linguistic patterns to improve video description.\\nThis study integrates linguistic data into a video-captioning model based on Long Short Term Memory\\n(LSTM) RNNs, known for state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, LSTMs function effectively\\nas language models (LMs). Our initial method (early fusion) involves pre-training the network\\nusing plain text prior to training with parallel video-text datasets. Our subsequent two methods,\\ninfluenced by current MT research, incorporate an LSTM LM with the existing video-to-text model.\\nFurthermore, we explore substituting the standard one-hot word encoding with distributional vectors\\nderived from external datasets.\\nWe present thorough comparisons across these methods, assessing them on a typical YouTube corpus\\nand two recently released extensive movie description datasets. The findings indicate notable gains in\\ndescription grammaticality (as assessed by crowdsourced human evaluations) and moderate gains in\\ndescriptive quality (as determined by human judgements and automated comparisons against human-\\ngenerated descriptions). Our main contributions include: (1) numerous approaches to integrate\\nknowledge from external text into a current captioning model, (2) comprehensive experiments\\ncomparing methods on three large video-caption datasets, and (3) human assessments demonstrating\\nthat external linguistic knowledge notably impacts grammar.2 LSTM-based Video Description\\nWe employ the S2VT video description framework, which we describe briefly here. S2VT adopts a\\nsequence-to-sequence approach that maps an input video frame feature sequence to a fixed-dimension\\nvector, which is then decoded into a sequence of output words.\\nAs depicted in the architecture employs a dual-layered LSTM network. The input to the initial LSTM\\nlayer is a sequence of frame features extracted from the second-to-last layer (fc7) of a Convolutional\\nNeural Network (CNN) after the ReLU operation. This LSTM layer encodes the video sequence. At\\neach step, the hidden state is fed into the subsequent LSTM layer. Following the processing of all\\nframes, the second LSTM layer is trained to transform this state into a sequence of words. This can be\\nthought of as using one LSTM to model visual features and another to model language, conditioned\\non the visual data. We modify this structure to incorporate linguistic information during training and\\ngeneration. Although our techniques are based on S2VT, they are sufficiently general and could be\\napplied to other CNN-RNN based captioning models.\\n3 Approach\\nCurrent visual captioning models are trained solely on text from the caption datasets and display some\\nlinguistic anomalies stemming from a limited language model and vocabulary. Here, we explore\\nseveral methods to integrate prior linguistic knowledge into a CNN/LSTM network for video-to-text\\n(S2VT) and assess how well they improve overall description quality.\\n3.1 Early Fusion\\nOur early fusion method involves initially pre-training the language-modeling components of the\\nnetwork on large raw NL text datasets, before fine-tuning these parameters on video-text paired\\ndatasets. An LSTM model can learn the probability of an output sequence given an input. To learn a\\nlanguage model, we train the LSTM layer to predict the next word based on the preceding words.\\nFollowing the S2VT design, we embed one-hot encoded words into reduced-dimension vectors. The\\nnetwork is trained on extensive text datasets, and its parameters are learned using backpropagation\\nwith stochastic gradient descent. The weights from this network initialize the embedding and weights\\nof the LSTM layers in S2VT, which is then trained on video-text data. This trained LM is also utilized\\nas the LSTM LM in both late and deep fusion models.\\n3.2 Late Fusion\\nOur late fusion approach draws inspiration from how neural machine translation models incorporate\\na trained language model during decoding. At each step of sentence generation, the video caption\\nmodel generates a probability distribution over the vocabulary. We then utilize the language model\\nto re-score the final output by considering a weighted average of the scores from the LM and the\\nS2VT video-description model (VM). Specifically, for output at time step ’t’, and given proposal\\ndistributions from the video captioning model and the language model, we can calculate the re-scored\\nprobability of each new word as:\\np(yt = y) =α · pV M(yt = y) + (1− α) · pLM (yt = y) (1)\\nThe hyper-parameter is tuned on the validation set.\\n3.3 Deep Fusion\\nIn the deep fusion approach, we integrate the LM more profoundly in the generation process. We\\nachieve this by concatenating the hidden state of the language model LSTM (hLM ) with the hidden\\nstate of the S2VT video description model (hV M) and use the resulting combined latent vector to\\npredict the output word. This is similar to the method employed to incorporate language models\\nfrom monolingual data for machine translation. However, our method differs in two ways: (1) We\\nconcatenate only the hidden states of the S2VT LSTM and language LSTM, without additional\\ncontext. (2) We keep the weights of the LSTM language model constant while training the entire\\nvideo captioning network. The probability of a predicted word at time step t is:\\np(yt|G<t, T) ∝ exp(WE(hV\\nt ⊕ WT hLM\\nt ) +b) (2)\\n2where V is the visual feature input, W represents the weight matrix, and b stands for biases. We\\navoid fine-tuning the LSTM LM to avoid overwriting previously learned weights of a strong language\\nmodel. However, the full video caption model is trained to integrate LM outputs while being trained\\non captioning data.\\n3.4 Distributional Word Representations\\nThe S2VT network, like many image and video captioning models, uses a one-hot encoding for\\nwords. During training, the model learns to embed these one-hot words into a 500-dimensional\\nspace via linear transformation. This embedding, however, is learned from the limited and possibly\\nnoisy caption data. Many techniques exist that leverage large text datasets to learn vector-space\\nrepresentations of words, capturing nuanced semantic and syntactic structures. We aim to capitalize\\non these to enhance video description. Specifically, we replace the embedding matrix from one-hot\\nvectors with 300-dimensional GloVe vectors, pre-trained on 6B tokens from Gigaword and Wikipedia\\n2014. We further explore variations where the model predicts both the one-hot word (softmax loss)\\nand the distributional vector from the LSTM hidden state using Euclidean loss. The output vector (yt)\\nis computed as yt = (Wght + bg), and the loss is:\\nL(yt, wglove) =||(Wght + bg) − wglove||2 (3)\\nwhere ht is the LSTM output, wglove is the GloVe embedding, and W and b are weights and biases.\\nThe network becomes a multi-task model with dual loss functions, which we use to influence weight\\nlearning.\\n3.5 Ensembling\\nThe loss function of the video-caption network is non-convex and hard to optimize. In practice, using\\nan ensemble of trained networks can improve performance. We also present results of an ensemble\\ncreated by averaging predictions from the highest performing models.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Datasets\\nOur language model was trained using sentences from Gigaword, BNC, UkWaC, and Wikipedia.\\nThe vocabulary contained the 72,700 most frequent tokens, also including GloVe embeddings.\\nFollowing evaluation we compare our models on the YouTube dataset, along with two extensive\\nmovie description datasets: MPII-MD and M-V AD.\\n4.2 Evaluation Metrics\\nWe assess performance using machine translation metrics, METEOR and BLEU, to compare model-\\ngenerated descriptions with human-written descriptions. For movie datasets with a single description,\\nwe use only METEOR, as it is more robust.\\n4.3 Human Evaluation\\nWe also collect human judgments on a random subset of 200 video clips for each dataset through\\nAmazon Turk. Each sentence was evaluated by three workers on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 (higher is\\nbetter) for relevance and grammar. Grammar evaluations were done without viewing videos. Movie\\nevaluation focused solely on grammar due to copyright.\\n4.4 YouTube Video Dataset Results\\nThe results show Deep Fusion performed well for both METEOR and BLEU scores. The integration\\nof Glove embeddings considerably increased METEOR, and combining both techniques performed\\nbest. Our final model is an ensemble (weighted average) of the Glove model and two Glove+Deep\\nFusion models trained on external and in-domain COCO sentences. While the state-of-the-art on this\\ndataset is achieved using attention to encode the video our work focuses on language modeling.\\n3Model METEOR B-4 Relevance Grammar\\nS2VT 29.2 37.0 2.06 3.76\\nEarly Fusion 29.6 37.6 - -\\nLate Fusion 29.4 37.2 - -\\nDeep Fusion 29.6 39.3 - -\\nGlove 30.0 37.0 - -\\nGlove+Deep - Web Corpus 30.3 38.1 2.12 4.05*\\nGlove+Deep - In-Domain 30.3 38.8 2.21* 4.17*\\nEnsemble 31.4 42.1 2.24* 4.20*\\nHuman - - 4.52 4.47\\nTable 1: Results on the YouTube dataset: METEOR and BLEU@4 scores (in %), along with human\\nratings (1-5) on relevance and grammar. * denotes a significant improvement over S2VT.\\nHuman ratings align closely with METEOR scores, indicating modest gains in descriptive quality.\\nLinguistic knowledge enhances the grammar of the results.

Some works also incorporate\\nexternal data to improve video description, however, our focus is on integrating external linguistic\\nknowledge for video captioning. We explore the use of distributional semantic embeddings and\\nLSTM-based language models trained on external text datasets.\\nLSTMs have proven to be effective language models. Other works have developed an LSTM model\\nfor machine translation that incorporates a monolingual language model for the target language,\\nachieving improved results. We utilize similar techniques (late fusion, deep fusion) to train an LSTM\\nfor video-to-text translation. This model uses large monolingual datasets to enhance RNN-based\\nvideo description networks. Unlike other approaches where the monolingual LM is used solely for\\nparameter tuning, our approach utilizes the output of the language model as an input for training the\\nfull underlying video description network.\\n4Other recent works propose video description models that focus primarily on improving the video\\nrepresentation itself with hierarchical visual pipelines and attention mechanisms. Without the attention\\nmechanism their models achieve good METEOR scores on the YouTube dataset. The interesting\\naspect is that the contribution of language alone is considerable. Hence, it is important to focus on\\nboth aspects to generate better descriptions.\\n6 Conclusion\\nThis study investigates methods to integrate linguistic knowledge from text datasets for video\\ncaptioning. Our assessments on YouTube videos and two movie description datasets show improved\\nresults according to human evaluations of grammar while also modestly improving the descriptive\\nquality of sentences. Although the proposed methods are assessed on a particular video-captioning\\nnetwork, they are applicable to other video and image captioning models.\\n5'},\n",

Specifically, we first utilize VideoCLIP to generate video-script alignment\\nfeatures. Afterwards, we ground the question-relevant content in instructional\\nvideos. Then, we reweight the multimodal context to emphasize prominent features.\\nFinally, we adopt GRU to conduct multi-step inference. Through comprehensive\\nexperiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper addresses the critical task of assisting users in navigating unfamiliar events for specific\\ndevices by providing step-by-step guidance using knowledge acquired from instructional videos.\\nDue to the substantial disparity among specific tasks, the integration of multimodal input, and the\\ncomplexity of multi-step inference, this is still a challenging task.\\nSeveral studies have been proposed to address this task. For instance, one study proposes a Question-\\nto-Actions (Q2A) Model, which employs vision transformer (ViT) and BERT to extract visual and\\ntextual features, respectively. Moreover, attention mechanisms are leveraged to anchor question-\\nrelevant information in instructional videos. Another study proposes a two-stage Function-centric\\napproach, which segments both the script and video into function clips instead of sentences or\\nframes. Additionally, they substitute BERT with XL-Net for text encoding. Despite the advancements\\nachieved through these techniques, all of them adopt the unaligned pretrained encoders to extract\\nvisual and textual features, leading to significant semantic gaps between modalities, thereby hindering\\nbetter results.\\nTo alleviate the negative effects of modalities unalignment, in this paper, we leverage pretrained\\nvideo-text models to achieve instructional video-text alignment, facilitating a more robust grounding\\nof question-relevant knowledge for multi-step inference. We build the pipeline with four steps:\\nInstructional Video Alignment, Question-Aware Grounding, Multimodal Context Reweighting and\\nMulti-Step Inference. Specifically, we employ pretrained VideoCLIP for generating video-script\\nalignment features, which are beneficial to cross-modal grounding. Subsequently, we anchor the\\nquestion-relevant content in instructional videos by the combination of hard and soft grounding.\\nAfterwards, we leverage additive attention to adjust the weighting of the multimodal context to\\nemphasize the salient features. Finally, we employ GRU for performing multi-step inference. We\\nreduce the proportion of teacher forcing linearly to bridge the gap between training and inference,\\nwhich boosts the multi-step inference.\\n2 Problem Definition\\nIn this section, we formulate the problem of AQTC.\\nGiven an instructional video, which contains numerous frames and scripts, AI assistant extracts\\nrelevant information from the video in accordance with the user˘2019s question q. Then, it deduces\\nthe correct answer ai j based on the image U as perceived by the user, from the candidate answer set\\nAnsi = ai 1, ai 2, ..., ai n in i-th step. Following previous work, we segment the video into several clips\\nbased on scripts. Each clip illustrates one specific function of the device in video. We concatenate\\n.these clips to form the visual function sequence as [F v 2 , ..., F v 1 , F v m] and the textual function\\nsequence as [F t 1, F t 2, ..., F t m], where F v i comprises all frames of the i-th function˘2019s clip,\\nand F t i contains all script sentences of the i-th function ˘2019s clip. To adapt AI assistant to the\\nuser˘2019s view, following previous work, we mask the referenced button related to candidate answers\\nin user images U , denoted as bk.\\n3 Method\\nIn this section, we will introduce the details of our method. Our method consists of four steps:\\nInstructional Video Alignment, Question-Aware Grounding, Multimodal Context Reweighting and\\nMulti-Step Inference.\\n3.1 Instructional Video Alignment\\nTo align the videos and the text for better cross-modal understanding, we leverage pretrained Video-\\nCLIP to generate the features of instructional videos. For the video part, we initially utilize pretrained\\nS3D to generate an embedding for each second of the video, with a frame rate of 30 frames per second.\\nNext, to represent each function within the videos, we utilize the pretrained visual transformer from\\nVideoCLIP to process the embeddings generated by S3D in each function. Then, we apply average\\npooling over the processed sequence of embeddings to form the video embedding Vi corresponding\\nto a given visual function F v i . For the text part, we use the pretrained textual transformer of\\nVideoCLIP to encode the scripts of a textual function F t i . Similarly, we employ average pooling to\\naggregate the processed sequence of text, generating the text embedding Ti of a given textual function\\nF t i . Finally, we obtain the video feature sequence [V1, V2, ..., Vm] and the text feature sequence\\n[T1, T2, ..., Tm] of the given function sequence.\\nBesides, we also utilize VideoCLIP to encode the questions q, the answer ai j and the masked button\\nimage bk. We duplicate the images 30 times to ensure consistent video encoding. We get the question\\nfeature Q, answer feature Ai j and visual button feature Bk.\\n3.2 Question-Aware Grounding\\nOwing to the extensive pretraining of VideoCLIP on a vast collection of videos, the features of videos\\nand text are cross-modal aligned. Therefore, we can utilize the question Q to ground the video and\\ntext feature sequence directly. Specifically, we leverage three grounding mechanisms: soft, hard and\\ncombined grounding. Soft grounding employs attention to learn the similarity between the question\\nfeature Q and the video feature sequence [V1, V2, ..., Vm] directly. And, it uses another attention\\nnetwork to compute the similarity between the question feature Q and the text feature sequence [T1,\\nT2, ..., Tm]. Soft grounding adopts the similarity from two attention networks to perform a weighted\\naverage of the two feature sequences, respectively. Instead of relying on deep learning methods, hard\\ngrounding follows previous work, which uses TF-IDF model to calculate the similarity between the\\nquestion q and each textual function F t i from textual function sequence [F t 1, F t 2, ..., F t m].\\nThen, it uses the similarities as the weights to compute the averages of the video feature sequence\\n[V1, V2, ..., Vm] and the text feature sequence [T1, T2, ..., Tm], respectively. Besides, the combined\\ngrounding utilizes soft grounding and hard grounding simultaneously. Then, the two features from\\ntwo grounding methods are averaged. Ultimately, we obtain the aggregated question-aware video\\nfeature V and text feature T .\\n3.3 Multimodal Context Reweighting\\nAfter obtaining multimodal question-aware context features from instructional videos, we need to\\nmodel the answers to determine the correct one. Specifically, we utilize the gate network to fuse\\nthe candidate answer feature Ai j with the corresponding button feature Bk, which generates the\\nmultimodal answer feature ˘02c6Ai j. We concatenate these multimodal contexts into a sequence [V ,\\nT, Q, ˘02c6Ai j] for each candidate answer. Due to the varying importance of different context features\\nin determining the correct answers, we utilize additive attention to reweight the multimodal context\\nand get the fused feature. Finally, the fused feature is processed using a two-layer MLP to obtain the\\ncandidate answer context feature C i j.\\n23.4 Multi-Step Inference\\nOwing to the requirement for multi-step guidance in order to respond to the given questions, it is\\nessential for models to perform multi-step inference. Following previous work, we utilize GRU to\\ninfer the current correct answer by incorporating historical knowledge. Specifically, we feed the\\nprevious hidden state H i˘22121 and the contextual features C i j of candidate answers in Ansi into\\nthe GRU. Then, the resulting current hidden state H i j for each candidate answer in Ansi is utilized\\nto predict the correct answer in the i-th step. We adopt a two-layer MLP and the softmax function\\non the concatenated current hidden states [H i 1, H i 2, ..., H i n] to generate the probability of the\\ncorrect answer. Cross entropy is used to compute the loss. While previous works utilize the state of\\nthe ground truth as the historical state of the next step H i. This causes a huge gap between training\\nand inference. To bridge this gap, we reduce the reliance on teacher forcing linearly. In other words,\\nwe choose the hidden state of the most probable answer predicted by models as the historical state of\\nthe next step H i, when a sample is selected for autoregressive training.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Dataset and Implementation Details\\nWe use AssistQ train@22 and test@22 sets to train and validate. And we test our model on the\\nAssistQ test@23 dataset.\\nIn our experiments, we use Adam optimizer with a learning rate 10˘22124. The batch size is set to 16,\\nthe maximum training epoch is 100, and we adopt early stopping. We randomly select 5\\n4.2 Performance Evaluation\\nWe present the performance evaluation on the test dataset in Table 1a. We find that our method\\noutperforms baseline methods. This superiority can be attributed to our utilization of a video-text\\naligned pretrained encoder for feature extraction. The aligned features are beneficial to multi-step\\ninference.

       "  'file_content': 'An Examination of Expansive Multimodal Models:\\nInsights from an Educational Overview\\nAbstract\\nThis document provides a summary of a presentation centered on extensive multi-\\nmodal models, specifically their development to a level comparable to and poten-\\ntially exceeding that of multimodal GPT-4. The exploration is divided into three\\nsections. Initially, the context is established by discussing recent large-scale models\\nakin to GPT, which are designed for vision and language processing. This sets the\\nstage for exploring research in large multimodal models (LMMs) that are fine-tuned\\nwith instructions. Subsequently, the foundational aspects of instruction tuning in\\nlarge language models are covered, which is a method that is further adapted to\\nthe multimodal domain. The final section demonstrates the creation of a basic\\nversion of multimodal models similar to GPT-4 using publicly available resources.\\nAdditionally, a review of newly developing areas in this field is presented.\\n1 Introduction\\nWith the widespread integration of advanced language models into modern society, there’s a burgeon-\\ning enthusiasm among scholars and scientists to create open-source large language models (LLMs)\\nand to investigate their growth into large multimodal models (LMMs). This manuscript concentrates\\non leveraging LLMs for multimodal applications and training LMMs in a comprehensive manner,\\nenabling them to process visual data and engage in conversation.\\n2 Background\\n2.1 Image-to-Text Generative Models\\nIn their present configuration, LMMs predominantly function as image-to-text generators, accepting\\nimages as input and producing textual content as output. The architectural design of these models\\ngenerally includes an image encoder for deriving visual characteristics and a language model for\\ngenerating textual sequences. These visual and linguistic components can be interconnected through\\nan adaptable module. Both the image encoder and the language model have the flexibility to be\\ndeveloped from the ground up or based on previously trained models.\\nThe training methodology typically involves employing an auto-regressive loss on the generated text\\ntokens. Within the Transformer framework, image tokens have the capability to interact with one\\nanother, and each text token is influenced by the preceding text tokens and all image tokens.\\n2.2 Case Studies\\nWe will analyze several established LMMs to demonstrate how the architecture can be actualized\\nacross various models while adhering to the same auto-regressive training principle.\\n**Case Study I: LMM Trained with Image-Text Pairs**\\nMany LMMs are developed using extensive collections of image-text pairs. Notable models like Gen-\\nerative Image-to-Text Transformer (GIT) and Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training (BLIP2)\\n.have set high standards across various datasets. GIT utilizes an image encoder from a contrastive\\npre-trained model and builds a language model independently. Conversely, BLIP2 maintains the\\npre-trained image and language models in a fixed state while incorporating a trainable Querying\\nTransformer (Q-former), demonstrating efficiency through a unique bootstrapping technique.\\n**Case Study II: LMM Trained with Interleaved Image-Text Sequences**\\nFlamingo serves as an exemplary model in this category, incorporating pre-trained image and language\\nmodels with the addition of new integrative components. It includes a Perceiver Sampler to streamline\\ncomputational demands and a Gated Transformer to enhance stability during the early training phase.\\nFlamingo is trained on a diverse mix of large-scale multimodal data sourced exclusively from the web,\\nbypassing the need for conventionally annotated machine learning datasets. Post-training, Flamingo\\ncan adapt to vision-based tasks through few-shot learning without additional task-specific tuning.\\nA standout feature of Flamingo is its capability for multimodal in-context learning. When presented\\nwith image-text pairs as a demonstration, Flamingo can generalize to new, unseen tasks, such\\nas visual math problems, without further training. It successfully interprets the patterns in task\\ninstructions from examples and applies this understanding to new images. Flamingo represents\\na significant advancement in multimodal learning, akin to the breakthroughs seen with GPT-3 in\\nlanguage processing.\\n2.3 OpenAI Multimodal GPT-4 and Research Gaps\\nReleased in March 2023, OpenAI’s GPT-4 showcases advanced capabilities in understanding and\\nreasoning with visual data. Although specifics of the model remain undisclosed, its ability to facilitate\\nnew applications is evident from highlighted examples in technical reports. For instance, it can\\ndiscern unusual elements within images and demonstrate sophisticated reasoning across text and\\nimages.\\nThe inquiry into constructing models akin to Multimodal GPT-4 leads us to examine OpenAI’s\\nadvanced models, as depicted in Figure 7. Key observations are: (i) GPT-2 serves as the auto-\\nregressive equivalent in the era dominated by BERT’s pre-training then fine-tuning paradigm. (ii)\\nGPT-3, a 175-billion parameter model trained on extensive web text, showcases emergent properties\\nsuch as in-context learning and chain-of-thoughts (CoT) reasoning without requiring further training.\\nThis model represents a shift from fine-tuning model weights to utilizing prompts for broader\\ngeneralization and reduced adaptation costs. (iii) ChatGPT and InstructGPT emphasize the importance\\nof models following instructions and aligning with human intentions by fine-tuning on high-quality\\ninstruction data and using a reinforcement learning framework. (iv) GPT-4 not only enhances previous\\nmodels’ language capabilities but also incorporates visual inputs for comprehension and reasoning.\\n3 Pre-requisite: Instruction Tuning in Large Language Models\\nInstruction-following is a concept that originated in the field of natural language processing (NLP). To\\nunderstand this concept more deeply and trace its development, we revisit the practice of instruction\\ntuning in conjunction with LLMs.\\n3.1 Instruction Tuning\\n**Traditional Language Data**\\nIn the realm of natural language processing, the seq2seq format is frequently employed, where\\neach data point comprises an input sequence and a corresponding output sequence. Typically, task\\ninstructions are implicitly understood rather than explicitly stated. Models trained on this data format\\noften struggle to adapt to new tasks in a zero-shot manner because they lack the ability to interpret\\nand generalize task instructions during testing.\\n**Instruct Language Data**\\nRecent advancements involve the explicit incorporation of task instructions during model training.\\nThese instructions, often articulated in natural language, lead to a structured format of instruction-\\ninput-output triplets. This enables the training of a single model capable of handling multiple tasks\\n2with clear directives. The exposure to varied task instructions and examples during training allows\\nthe model to generalize to novel tasks through task composition during inference.\\n3.2 Self-Instruct and Open-Source LLMs\\nThe collection of a wide array of high-quality instruction-following data can be achieved through\\ntwo primary methods: human-human interaction and human-machine interaction. The former is\\nresource-intensive, involving human task providers and annotators, while the latter involves machines\\nor models performing the annotation tasks under human guidance.\\nSelf-Instruct tuning represents a streamlined and potent method for aligning LLMs with human\\nintent, utilizing instruction-following data produced by leading teacher LLMs. This technique,\\nwhich leverages the in-context learning capability of LLMs, has significantly enhanced the zero- and\\nfew-shot generalization abilities of LLMs. The iterative process, as illustrated in Figure 9, involves\\nhumans providing initial examples, which the LLM then uses to generate further instructions and\\nresponses, refining the dataset iteratively.\\n4 Instructed Tuned Large Multimodal Models\\nThis section describes the development of a minimal multimodal GPT-4 model using open-source\\ntools, with a focus on the LLaV A model, and a similar approach in the MiniGPT-4 project.\\n4.1 Open-Source Prototypes: LLaV A / MiniGPT4\\nInspired by successful concepts in NLP, we apply the self-instruct methodology from language\\nprocessing to the vision-and-language domain. A significant challenge is the absence of a robust\\nmultimodal teacher model. Thus, we explore how language-only models like GPT-4 can generate\\nmultimodal instruction-following data.\\n4.1.1 Data Creation\\nInstead of directly inputting images into OpenAI GPT, symbolic sequence representations are used,\\nas shown in Figure 12 (a). LLaV A utilizes captions and bounding boxes for several reasons: (1)\\nGPT-4 is found to comprehend these representations effectively, unlike ChatGPT, which struggles\\nwith bounding box data; (2) these elements are crucial for an informative representation of the image.\\nAs demonstrated in Figure 12 (b), three forms of instruction-following data are used: multi-turn\\nconversations for interactive user engagement, detailed descriptions for comprehensive response\\ngeneration, and complex reasoning to address the implications beyond the image content.\\n4.1.2 Network Architecture and Training\\nAs shown in Figure 13, LLaV A’s architecture is a specific implementation of the general image-to-text\\ngenerative model framework discussed in Section 2 and Figure 3. LLaV A integrates a pre-trained\\nCLIP ViT-L/14 visual encoder with the Vicuna large language model via a projection matrix. The\\ntraining process involves two stages:\\n- **Stage 1: Pre-training for Feature Alignment.** Only the projection matrix is updated using\\na portion of the CC3M dataset, focusing solely on image captioning. - **Stage 2: End-to-End\\nFine-tuning.** Both the projection matrix and the LLM are fine-tuned to cater to various application\\nscenarios.\\n4.1.3 Performance\\n**Performance on Visual Chat**\\nWhen fine-tuned on diverse multimodal instruction-following data, LLaV A demonstrates effectiveness\\nin user-oriented applications. Empirical evidence suggests that adjusting only the linear projection\\nlayer is adequate for conversational scenarios, although it necessitates longer training periods.\\nIn an evaluation using 30 unseen images, each paired with three types of instructions, LLaV A achieved\\nan 85.1\\n3**Performance on Science QA**\\nLLaV A, when fine-tuned on a scientific multimodal reasoning dataset, achieved a 90.92\\n**Performance on OCR in the Wild**\\nDespite not being explicitly trained on OCR data, LLaV A exhibits a surprising zero-shot OCR\\ncapability, as illustrated in Figure 16.\\nEmerging Topics\\n4.1.4 More Modalities (Beyond VL)\\n- **ChatBridge**: This model innovates by employing a Large Language Model as a linguistic\\nmediator to connect different modalities [65]. -

The technical documentation from OpenAI\\nprovides examples of complex visual tasks that necessitate models capable of processing numerous\\nhigh-resolution images and extended sequences, in addition to delivering responses that require spe-\\ncialized knowledge. This demands significantly greater computational power and more sophisticated\\nlanguage models, which are generally not accessible to most individuals.\\n6 Conclusion\\nThis paper has outlined the foundational aspects and advanced functionalities of large multimodal\\nmodels (LMMs).

Furthermore, it has categorized and summarized the most recent advancements in this research\\narea, offering a starting point for those keen to embark on LMM exploration.\\nThe paper also proposes future directions for community-driven efforts. It suggests that entities with\\nsubstantial resources should concentrate on scaling existing capabilities and exploring new emergent\\nproperties.

       "  'file_content': 'The Significance of Fillers in Textual Representations\\nof Speech Transcripts\\nAbstract\\nThis paper investigates the role of fillers within text-based representations of speech\\ntranscripts. While often ignored in Spoken Language Understanding tasks, we\\ndemonstrate that these elements, such as \"um\" or \"uh,\" when incorporated using\\ndeep contextualized embeddings, enhance the modeling of spoken language. This\\nis further shown through improvements in downstream tasks like predicting a\\nspeaker’s stance and their expressed confidence.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper addresses the critical role of disfluencies, specifically fillers, in spoken language processing.\\nDisfluencies, which encompass phenomena like silent pauses, word repetitions, or self-corrections,\\nare inherent to spoken language. Fillers, a type of disfluency, often manifest as sounds like \"um\" or\\n\"uh,\" serving to bridge pauses during utterances or conversations.\\nWhile prior research has demonstrated the efficacy of contextualized embeddings pre-trained on\\nwritten text for adapting to smaller spoken language corpora, these models typically exclude fillers and\\ndisfluencies in pre-processing. This practice is at odds with linguistic research, which considers fillers\\nto be informative and integral to spoken language. Existing methods for analyzing fillers primarily\\nrely on handcrafted features. Furthermore, pre-trained word embeddings trained on written text\\nhave shown poor performance in representing spontaneous speech words like \"uh,\" as their meaning\\nvaries significantly in spoken contexts. In this work, we explore the use of deep contextualized word\\nrepresentations to model fillers. We assess their value in spoken language tasks without relying on\\nmanual feature engineering.\\nThe core motivation of this study stems from the following observations: First, fillers are essential\\nto spoken language. For instance, speakers may employ fillers to signal the linguistic structure of\\ntheir utterances, such as difficulties in choosing vocabulary or to indicate a pause in their speech.\\nSecond, research has connected fillers and prosodic cues to a speaker’s Feeling of Knowing (FOK)\\nor expressed confidence, signifying a speaker’s commitment to a statement. Fillers and prosodic\\ncues influence a listener’s perception of a speaker’s expressed confidence, known as the Feeling\\nof Another’s Knowing (FOAK). Finally, fillers have been successfully applied in stance prediction,\\nwhich gauges a speaker’s subjective attitude.\\nTherefore, we intend to validate these observations by exploring how to efficiently represent fillers\\nautomatically. Our key contributions are: (1) Fillers convey useful information that can be harnessed\\nthrough deep contextualized embeddings to improve spoken language modeling and should not be\\ndiscarded. We also investigate the best filler representation strategies for Spoken Language Modeling\\n(SLM) and examine the learned positional distribution of fillers. (2) In a spontaneous speech corpus\\nof monologues, we show that fillers serve as a distinctive feature in predicting both a speaker’s\\nperceived confidence and their expressed sentiment.2 Models and Data Description\\n2.1 Model Description\\nIn this work, we focus on the two fillers \"uh\" and \"um.\" To generate contextualized word embeddings\\nfor fillers, we use Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), given its state-\\nof-the-art performance in several NLP tasks and its enhanced ability to integrate context compared to\\nWord2Vec.\\n2.1.1 Spoken Language Modeling\\nWe utilize a masked language modeling (MLM) approach for Spoken Language Modeling. This\\ninvolves masking some input words at random and then attempting to predict those masked tokens.\\nThis is a standard way of pre-training and fine-tuning BERT. In our case, this method will be used to\\nfine-tune a pre-trained BERT model on a spoken language corpus. Each experiment involves a token\\nrepresentation strategy i and a pre-processing strategy Si.\\nThe token representation strategies are essential for our goal of learning the distribution of fillers\\nusing BERT. The three token representation strategies are outlined as follows: T1 involves no special\\nprocessing for the fillers and BERT is left to use its prior understanding of fillers to model language.\\nIn T2, \"uh\" and \"um\" are marked with specific filler tags to distinguish them from other tokens, with\\neach filler represented as separate tokens. This strategy encourages BERT to learn new embeddings\\nthat emphasize filler context and position. In T3, both fillers are represented as the same token,\\nindicating that they carry the same meaning. Table 1 gives a concrete example of this process.\\n2.1.2 Pre-processing\\nWe investigate the impact of three pre-processing strategies denoted by S1, S2 and S3. In S1, all\\nfillers are removed from the sentences during both training and inference. In S2, fillers are kept\\nduring training, but removed during inference. In S3, fillers are preserved during both training and\\ninference. For each combination of pre-processing and token representation strategies, we fine-tune\\nBERT using the Masked Language Model objective like the original BERT paper. If fine-tuning is\\nnot performed the training data of S1 and S2 are equivalent. We evaluate the model performance in\\nlanguage modeling using perplexity (ppl).\\n2.1.3 Confidence and Sentiment Prediction\\nIn tasks of confidence prediction and sentiment analysis, our objective is to use BERT’s text rep-\\nresentations, which include fillers, to predict a confidence/sentiment label. We add a Multi-Layer\\nPerceptron (MLP) to BERT, which may have been fine-tuned using MLM. The MLP is trained by min-\\nimizing the mean squared error (MSE) loss. These experiments adopt the same token representation\\nand pre-processing techniques discussed in Section 2.1.1.\\n2.2 Data Description\\nWe use the Persuasive Opinion Mining (POM) dataset which contains 1000 English monologue\\nvideos. The speakers recorded themselves giving a movie review. The movies were rated between\\n1 (most negative) and 5 stars (most positive). The videos were annotated for high-level attributes\\nsuch as confidence, where annotators rated from 1 (not confident) to 7 (very confident). Similarly,\\nsentiment was scored by annotators between 1 (strongly negative) to 7 (strongly positive).\\nThis dataset was chosen for several reasons: (1) The corpus contains manual transcriptions with\\nfillers \"uh\" and \"um,\" where approximately 4% of speech consists of fillers. Additionally, sentence\\nmarkers are transcribed, with fillers at sentence beginnings if they occur between sentences. (2)\\nThe dataset includes monologues, where speakers are aware of an unseen listener, thus we can\\nconcentrate on fillers in speaker narratives. (3) The sentiment/stance polarity was clearly defined\\nby choosing only reviews that were rated with 1-2 or 5 stars for annotation purposes. (4) FOAK,\\nmeasured by confidence labels, has high inter-annotator agreement. More details can be found in\\nsupplementary materials. The confidence labels are the root mean square (RMS) values of labels\\ngiven by 3 annotators. The sentiment labels are the average of the 3 labels.\\n2Token.

[’umm’, ’things’, ’that’, ’uh’, ’you’, ’usually’, ’wouldn’, \"’\", ’t’, ’find’, ’funny’, ’were’, ’in’, ’this’, ’movie’, ’.’] [’umm’, ’things’, ’that’, ’uh’, ’you’, ’usually’, ’wouldn’, \"’\", ’t’, ’find’, ’funny’, ’were’, ’in’, ’this’, ’movie’, ’.’] [’[FILLERUMM]’, ’things’, ’that’, ’[FILLERUHH]’, ’you’, ’usually’, ’wouldn’, \"’\", ’t’, ’find’, ’funny’, ’were’, ’in’, ’this’, ’movie’, ’.’] [’[FILLER]’, ’things’, ’that’, ’[FILLER]’, ’you’, ’usually’, ’wouldn’, \"’\", ’t’, ’find’, ’funny’, ’were’, ’in’, ’this’, ’movie’, ’.’]\\nTable 1: Filler representation using different token representation strategies\\n3 Experiments and Analysis\\n3.1 Fillers Can Be Leveraged to Model Spoken Language\\nLanguage Modeling with fillers. We examine language model (LM) perplexity using various\\npre-processing strategies, using a fixed token representation strategy of T1. The results in Table 2(a)\\ncompares S1, S2 and S3. By keeping fillers during both training and inference, the model reaches a\\nlower perplexity, with a reduction of at least 10%. Therefore, fillers provide information that BERT\\ncan effectively use.\\nThe fine-tuning procedure improves the language model’s perplexity. Additionally, even without\\nfine-tuning, S3 outperforms S1 and S2 by reducing perplexity when fillers are used. This implies that\\nBERT has prior knowledge of spoken language and uses the fillers.\\nConsequently, fillers can reduce uncertainty of BERT for SLM. This is not an intuitive outcome; one\\nmight assume that removing fillers during training and inference would decrease perplexity. The\\nfact that S3 exceeds other preprocessing methods shows that the Masked Language Model (MLM)\\nprocess effectively learns this filler information.\\nBest token representation: The results presented in Table 2(b) reveal that T1 outperforms other\\nrepresentations when fine-tuning. Given the limited data and high BERT embedding dimensionality\\n(768), retaining existing representations with T1 is better than learning representations from the\\nscratch. Interestingly, T2 and T3 perform similarly. The hypothesis is that the difference between\\n\"uh\" and \"um\" lies only in the duration of the pause, which cannot be captured in text. Considering\\nthese results, T1 is fixed as the token representation strategy in all subsequent experiments.\\nLearned positional distribution of fillers: We further test our model’s learning of filler placement.\\nWe fine-tune BERT using a filler to determine where the model believes the fillers most likely reside.\\nGiven a sentence S with length L, we introduce a mask token after the word j and obtain S*. We then\\ncompute the probability of a filler in position j+1.\\nSpecifically, we calculate P([MASK=filler] | S), as depicted in Figure 1. Then, we plot the average\\nprobability of the masked word being a filler given its sentence position in Figure 2. The fine-tuned\\nBERT model with fillers predicts a high probability of fillers occurring at the beginning of sentences.\\nThis pattern is consistent with filler distribution in the dataset. The fine-tuned BERT without fillers,\\npredicts constant low probabilities. Given that we only know sentence boundaries we still manage\\nto observe that the model captures a similar positional distribution of fillers that are found in other\\nworks.\\n(a) LM Task (b) Best token representation (c) FOAK and Sentiment\\nFine Setting Token Ppl Setting Token FOAK Sent\\n3*w/o S1 T1 22 3* S3 T1 1.47 1.98\\nS2 T1 22 T2 1.45 1.75\\nS3 T1 20 T3 1.30 1.44\\n3*w S1 T1 5.5 3* S3 T1 1.32 1.39\\nS2 T1 5.6 T2 1.31 1.40\\nS3 T1 4.6 T3 1.24 1.22\\nTable 2: From left to right, the (a) LM Task, (b) Best token representation, (c) MSE of Confidence\\n(FOAK) and the Sentiment (Sent) prediction task.

Illustrates the [MASK] procedure for predicting the probability of a filler at position\\n5\\n3.2 Fillers are a discriminative feature for FOAK and stance prediction\\nWe look at the impact of fillers on two downstream tasks: FOAK prediction and sentiment analysis.\\nPsycholinguistic studies have found a link between fillers and expressed confidence. Prior work has\\nlinked fillers and a speaker’s expressed confidence in the narrow field of QA tasks. Fillers have also\\nbeen used to predict stance. In this work, we present data that suggests fillers play a role in predicting\\na speaker’s expressed confidence and their stance.\\nTable 2(c) shows that S3, both with and without fine-tuning, reduces the MSE compared to S1 and\\nS2. S1 and S2 have similar MSE since they remove fillers during inference. S2 has a higher MSE,\\npossibly due to the mismatch between training and test datasets. This demonstrates that fillers can be\\na discriminative feature in FOAK and stance prediction.\\nDoes using fillers always improve results for spoken language tasks? In the subsection 3.1, we\\nobserve that including fillers reduces MLM perplexity. An assumption is that that downstream tasks\\nwould also benefit from the inclusion of fillers. However, we notice that when predicting speaker\\npersuasiveness, the fillers are not a discriminative feature, following the same procedure as outlined\\nin subsubsection 2.1.2.\\n4 Conclusion\\nThis paper demonstrates that retaining fillers in transcribed spoken language when using deep\\ncontextualized representations can improve results in language modeling and downstream tasks\\nsuch as FOAK and stance prediction. We also propose and compare several token representation\\nand pre-processing strategies for integrating fillers. We plan to extend these results to consider\\ncombining textual filler-oriented representations with acoustic representations, and to further analyze\\nfiller representation learned during pre-training.\\n4'},\n",

This approach has the\\npotential to revolutionize the way goods are transported and delivered, particularly\\nin urban areas where traditional delivery methods often struggle to cope with high\\ndemand and congested infrastructure. By applying game-theoretic principles to the\\noptimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, researchers can develop more\\neffective and sustainable solutions that balance the needs of multiple stakeholders,\\nincluding delivery companies, crowdsourced workers, and end customers. How-\\never, this approach also raises important questions about the potential for chaos and\\nunpredictability in crowdsourced systems, and the need for novel methodologies\\nthat can account for the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these networks. In-\\nterestingly, our research reveals that the application of game-theoretic optimization\\nto crowdsourced delivery networks can lead to emergent behaviors that resemble\\nthe flocking patterns of birds, suggesting a potentially fruitful area of investigation\\nat the intersection of logistics, economics, and ornithology.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe rise of crowdsourced delivery networks has revolutionized the way goods are transported, lever-\\naging a vast network of independent drivers to efficiently deliver packages to customers. However,\\nthis paradigm shift has also introduced a plethora of complex optimization problems, as the inherent\\nunpredictability of crowdsourced systems can lead to inefficiencies and decreased customer satisfac-\\ntion. To mitigate these issues, researchers have begun to explore the application of game-theoretic\\noptimization techniques, which model the interactions between independent agents in a crowdsourced\\nnetwork as a competitive game. By analyzing the strategic decision-making processes of these\\nagents, game-theoretic optimization can provide valuable insights into the underlying dynamics of\\ncrowdsourced delivery networks, enabling the design of more efficient and scalable systems.\\nOne intriguing approach to optimizing crowdsourced delivery networks involves the use of evolution-\\nary game theory, where the behavior of agents is modeled as an evolutionary process, with strategies\\nevolving over time through a process of natural selection. This perspective allows researchers to\\nstudy the emergence of cooperative behavior among agents, which can lead to improved overall\\nsystem performance. However, an unexpected consequence of this approach is the potential for\\nthe emergence of \"cheating\" strategies, where agents exploit cooperative behavior to gain an unfair\\nadvantage. Interestingly, this phenomenon can be analogous to the evolution of cheating strategies in\\ncertain species of insects, where individual insects may adopt deceptive behaviors to increase their\\nreproductive success.\\nFurthermore, the application of game-theoretic optimization to crowdsourced delivery networks can\\nalso involve the use of unconventional optimization algorithms, such as those inspired by the foraging\\nbehaviors of slime molds. These algorithms, which model the growth and adaptation of slime moldcolonies, can be surprisingly effective in solving complex optimization problems, particularly those\\ninvolving dynamic and uncertain environments. However, the use of such algorithms can also lead to\\nseemingly illogical results, such as the optimization of delivery routes based on the simulated growth\\npatterns of slime molds. Despite the apparent absurdity of this approach, it can nevertheless provide\\nvaluable insights into the optimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, particularly in situations\\nwhere traditional optimization methods may fail.\\nThe study of game-theoretic optimization for crowdsourced delivery networks is also closely related\\nto the concept of \" swarm intelligence,\" which refers to the collective behavior of decentralized,\\nself-organized systems. In the context of crowdsourced delivery networks, swarm intelligence can be\\nused to model the emergence of complex patterns and behaviors, such as the spontaneous formation\\nof delivery routes or the adaptive response to changes in demand. However, this perspective can also\\nlead to some bizarre and counterintuitive results, such as the optimization of delivery networks based\\non the patterns of bird flocking or fish schooling. While these approaches may seem unrelated to the\\noptimization of crowdsourced delivery networks, they can nevertheless provide valuable insights into\\nthe underlying dynamics of these systems, and may even lead to the development of more efficient\\nand scalable optimization algorithms.\\nUltimately, the application of game-theoretic optimization to crowdsourced delivery networks is\\na complex and multifaceted problem, involving the intersection of multiple disciplines, including\\ncomputer science, operations research, and biology. By embracing unconventional approaches\\nand perspectives, researchers can develop novel and innovative solutions to the optimization of\\ncrowdsourced delivery networks, leading to improved efficiency, scalability, and customer satisfaction.\\nHowever, this may also involve tolerating a certain degree of illogic and absurdity in the optimization\\nprocess, as the most effective solutions may not always be the most intuitive or obvious ones.\\n2 Related Work\\nGame-theoretic optimization has been increasingly applied to crowdsourced delivery networks, where\\na large number of individuals contribute to the delivery process, often through online platforms.\\nThis approach has been shown to improve the efficiency and scalability of delivery networks, by\\nleveraging the collective efforts of many agents. In crowdsourced delivery networks, game-theoretic\\noptimization is used to design mechanisms that incentivize individuals to participate in the delivery\\nprocess, and to allocate tasks and resources in a way that maximizes overall system performance.\\nOne key challenge in crowdsourced delivery networks is the need to balance the competing interests of\\ndifferent stakeholders, including the platform, the delivery agents, and the customers. Game-theoretic\\noptimization provides a framework for analyzing these competing interests, and for designing\\nmechanisms that achieve a balance between them. For example, auction-based mechanisms can be\\nused to allocate tasks to delivery agents, while also ensuring that the platform’s objectives are met.\\nAnother approach that has been explored in the context of crowdsourced delivery networks is the use\\nof evolutionary game theory. This approach models the delivery network as a dynamic system, in\\nwhich agents adapt and evolve over time in response to changes in the environment. By analyzing\\nthe evolutionary dynamics of the system, researchers can identify stable states and predict the long-\\nterm behavior of the network. Interestingly, some research has suggested that the introduction\\nof \"dummy\" agents, which do not actually participate in the delivery process but rather serve to\\nconfuse or mislead other agents, can actually improve the overall performance of the network. This\\nseemingly counterintuitive result highlights the complex and often surprising nature of game-theoretic\\noptimization in crowdsourced delivery networks.\\nIn addition to these approaches, some researchers have explored the use of more unconventional\\nmethods, such as using swarm intelligence or flocking behavior to optimize the delivery process.\\nFor example, one study used a flocking algorithm to control a swarm of delivery drones, allowing\\nthem to adapt and respond to changes in the environment in a highly decentralized and autonomous\\nway. While this approach may seem bizarre or even frivolous at first glance, it has been shown to be\\nhighly effective in certain contexts, and highlights the potential for game-theoretic optimization to be\\napplied in a wide range of innovative and unconventional ways.\\nDespite the many advances that have been made in this area, there are still many challenges and\\nopen questions remaining in the field of game-theoretic optimization for crowdsourced delivery\\n2networks. For example, how can we ensure that the mechanisms we design are fair and equitable\\nfor all stakeholders, while also achieving high levels of efficiency and performance? How can we\\nbalance the need for decentralization and autonomy with the need for coordination and control? And\\nhow can we apply game-theoretic optimization to real-world delivery networks, which are often\\ncomplex and dynamic systems with many interacting components? By exploring these questions and\\nchallenges, researchers can continue to advance our understanding of game-theoretic optimization in\\ncrowdsourced delivery networks, and develop new and innovative solutions to the complex problems\\nthat arise in this context.\\nSome studies have also analyzed the impact of different types of agents on the overall performance\\nof the network, including the use of \"stubborn\" agents that refuse to adapt or change their behavior,\\nand \"malicious\" agents that actively seek to disrupt or undermine the network. Interestingly, these\\nstudies have shown that even in the presence of such agents, game-theoretic optimization can still be\\nused to achieve high levels of performance and efficiency, by designing mechanisms that are robust\\nto the presence of these agents. This highlights the flexibility and adaptability of game-theoretic\\noptimization, and its potential to be applied in a wide range of contexts and environments.\\nFurthermore, the incorporation of machine learning techniques into game-theoretic optimization\\nframeworks has also been explored, allowing for the development of more sophisticated and adaptive\\nmechanisms that can learn and respond to changes in the environment over time. For instance,\\nreinforcement learning can be used to optimize the parameters of a game-theoretic mechanism,\\nallowing it to adapt to changing conditions and improve its performance over time. This has been\\nshown to be particularly effective in contexts where the environment is highly dynamic or uncertain,\\nand where traditional game-theoretic approaches may struggle to achieve optimal results.\\nOverall, the field of game-theoretic optimization for crowdsourced delivery networks is a rich and\\nvibrant area of research, with many exciting advances and innovations being made on a regular\\nbasis. By continuing to explore and develop new approaches and techniques, researchers can help to\\nunlock the full potential of crowdsourced delivery networks, and create more efficient, scalable, and\\nsustainable systems for the future.\\n3 Methodology\\nTo tackle the complexities of crowdsourced delivery networks, we employ a game-theoretic optimiza-\\ntion framework that accounts for the strategic interactions between delivery agents and the network’s\\nunderlying infrastructure. The framework is built upon a non-cooperative game model, where each\\nagent seeks to minimize their individual cost function, which encompasses factors such as travel time,\\nfuel consumption, and monetary incentives. Notably, we incorporate an unconventional approach by\\nintroducing a \"chaos agent\" that randomly disrupts the network, simulating real-world uncertainties\\nand potential mishaps, such as unexpected traffic congestion or inclement weather. This chaos agent\\nis modeled as a non-player character in the game, whose actions are guided by a Markov chain that\\nperiodically introduces random perturbations to the network.\\nThe optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, where the objective\\nfunction seeks to balance the trade-off between minimizing the total network latency and maximizing\\nthe overall delivery throughput. However, we also introduce a peculiar constraint that requires at least\\n10\\nTo solve this optimization problem, we employ a customized version of the iterated greedy algorithm,\\nwhich iteratively improves the initial solution by applying a series of localized perturbations. Fur-\\nthermore, we integrate an unconventional \"dreaming\" phase, where the algorithm periodically enters\\na state of \"lucidity,\" during which it explores entirely new solution spaces, unencumbered by the\\nconstraints of the original problem formulation. This dreaming phase is inspired by the concept of\\noneirology, the study of dreams, and is designed to mimic the human brain’s ability to generate novel\\nsolutions during periods of relaxation and reduced cognitive inhibition.\\nThe algorithm’s performance is evaluated using a bespoke set of metrics, including the \"Delivery\\nHarmony Index\" (DHI), which measures the degree of synchronization between delivery agents,\\nand the \"Network Serendipity Coefficient\" (NSC), which quantifies the likelihood of unexpected,\\nyet beneficial, interactions between agents. These metrics are designed to capture the intricate\\ndynamics of crowdsourced delivery networks and provide a more nuanced understanding of the\\n3complex interplay between agents, infrastructure, and chaos. By adopting this game-theoretic\\noptimization framework, we aim to develop a more comprehensive and effective approach to managing\\ncrowdsourced delivery networks, one that acknowledges the inherent complexities and uncertainties\\nof these systems.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo validate the efficacy of our proposed game-theoretic optimization framework for crowdsourced\\ndelivery networks, we conducted a series of experiments on a simulated environment that mimicked\\nthe complexities of real-world delivery systems. The simulation platform was designed to accommo-\\ndate a variety of scenarios, including different numbers of couriers, customers, and package types,\\nallowing us to comprehensively test the robustness and adaptability of our approach.\\nOne of the key aspects of our experimental design was the incorporation of unpredictable events,\\nsuch as sudden changes in weather, traffic congestion, or unexpected increases in demand, to assess\\nhow well our framework could adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, we introduced a\\n\"rogue courier\" scenario, where a subset of couriers deliberately chose suboptimal routes or failed to\\ndeliver packages on time, to evaluate the resilience of our system against potential malfeasance.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, our experiments revealed that the introduction of a \"gamified\" element,\\nwhere couriers were incentivized through a competitive leaderboard and virtual rewards for efficient\\ndelivery, led to a significant improvement in overall system performance, even when the rogue\\ncourier scenario was activated. However, this outcome was overshadowed by the discovery that the\\noptimization algorithm occasionally entered a state of \"self-reinforcing chaos,\" where the pursuit\\nof individual courier goals resulted in a collective degradation of system efficiency, akin to a Nash\\nequilibrium of poor performance.\\nFurther analysis revealed that this phenomenon was closely tied to the emergence of \"delivery\\npatterns\" that defied logical explanation, such as couriers consistently choosing to travel in zigzag\\npatterns or deliberately avoiding certain areas of the map. Despite the apparent irrationality of these\\nbehaviors, our framework was able to learn from and adapt to these patterns, ultimately leading to\\nimproved overall system performance. We speculate that this may be due to the framework’s ability\\nto identify and exploit underlying structures in the data, even if they do not conform to traditional\\nnotions of optimality.\\nTo further explore the properties of our framework, we conducted an experiment where the delivery\\nnetwork was optimized in conjunction with a separate, unrelated system: a simulated ecosystem of\\nvirtual bees. The bees were tasked with collecting nectar from virtual flowers, and their movements\\nwere influenced by the delivery patterns of the couriers. The results were nothing short of astonishing,\\nwith the bees’ nectar collection efficiency increasing by over 30\\nIn an effort to provide a more detailed overview of our experimental findings, we have compiled\\nthe results of our simulation experiments into the following table: These results demonstrate the\\nTable 1: Experimental Results for Crowdsourced Delivery Network Optimization\\nScenario Number of Couriers Average Delivery Time Rogue Courier Rate\\nBaseline 100 45.2 minutes 0%\\nOptimized 100 32.1 minutes 0%\\nRogue Courier 100 51.5 minutes 20%\\nGamified 100 28.5 minutes 0%\\nSelf-Reinforcing Chaos 100 40.1 minutes 0%\\nVirtual Bees 100 38.5 minutes 0%\\npotential of our game-theoretic optimization framework to improve the efficiency and resilience of\\ncrowdsourced delivery networks, even in the presence of unpredictable events or rogue behavior.\\nFurthermore, they highlight the potential for unexpected synergies between different systems, and the\\nimportance of considering these interactions when designing and optimizing complex networks.\\n45 Results\\nThe application of neural style transfer to non-invasive medical visualization has yielded a plethora\\nof intriguing results, showcasing the potential for this technique to revolutionize the field of medical\\nimaging. By leveraging the capabilities of neural style transfer, researchers have been able to generate\\nhigh-quality, stylized visualizations of internal organs and tissues, which can be used to aid in\\ndiagnosis, treatment, and patient education.\\nOne of the most significant advantages of neural style transfer in medical visualization is its ability to\\nenhance the visual clarity of medical images, allowing for a more accurate diagnosis and treatment of\\nvarious diseases. For instance, by applying a neural style transfer algorithm to a set of MRI scans,\\nresearchers were able to generate stylized images of the brain, highlighting specific features such as\\ntumors, blood vessels, and neural pathways. These stylized images were found to be more effective in\\ncommunicating complex medical information to patients and clinicians, leading to improved patient\\noutcomes and more informed treatment decisions.\\nIn addition to its applications in medical imaging, neural style transfer has also been used to generate\\ninteractive, 3D visualizations of internal organs and tissues. These visualizations can be used to\\ncreate immersive, interactive experiences for medical students, allowing them to explore the human\\nbody in unprecedented detail. Furthermore, neural style transfer has been used to generate stylized\\nvisualizations of medical data, such as blood flow patterns and neural activity, which can be used to\\nidentify patterns and trends that may not be apparent through traditional visualization methods.\\nHowever, one bizarre approach that has been explored in the context of neural style transfer for\\nnon-invasive medical visualization is the use of \"dream-like\" visualizations, which involve generating\\nstylized images that are reminiscent of surreal, dream-like landscapes. These visualizations are\\ncreated by applying neural style transfer algorithms to medical images, using a set of pre-defined\\nstyles that are inspired by the works of famous artists, such as Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte.\\nWhile the clinical utility of these \"dream-like\" visualizations is still uncertain, they have been found\\nto be effective in reducing patient anxiety and improving patient engagement with medical imaging\\nprocedures.\\nTo further evaluate the effectiveness of neural style transfer in medical visualization, a series of\\nexperiments were conducted, involving the application of neural style transfer algorithms to a range\\nof medical images, including MRI scans, CT scans, and ultrasound images. The results of these\\nexperiments are presented in the following table:\\nTable 2: Comparison of neural style transfer algorithms for medical image visualization\\nAlgorithm Image Modality Stylization Quality Computational Efficiency\\nStyle Transfer MRI High Low\\nAdversarial Training CT Medium Medium\\nDeep Learning Ultrasound Low High\\nThe results of these experiments demonstrate the potential of neural style transfer to enhance the visual\\nclarity and aesthetic appeal of medical images, while also highlighting the need for further research\\ninto the clinical utility and computational efficiency of these algorithms. Overall, the application of\\nneural style transfer to non-invasive medical visualization has the potential to revolutionize the field of\\nmedical imaging, enabling clinicians and researchers to generate high-quality, stylized visualizations\\nthat can be used to improve patient outcomes and advance our understanding of human biology.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn the realm of non-invasive medical visualization, the integration of neural style transfer has\\nproven to be a pivotal innovation, enabling the transformation of medical images into stylized\\nvisualizations that facilitate enhanced diagnosis and patient care. This technology has the potential\\nto revolutionize the field of medical imaging by providing clinicians with a unique perspective on\\nanatomical structures and pathological conditions. By leveraging the capabilities of neural style\\ntransfer, medical professionals can generate stylized images that accentuate specific features, such as\\ntumors or vascular structures, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnoses and treatment plans.\\n5The application of neural style transfer in non-invasive medical visualization also raises intriguing\\npossibilities for patient education and engagement. By generating stylized images that are more\\naesthetically pleasing and easier to comprehend, patients can gain a deeper understanding of their\\nmedical conditions, fostering a more collaborative and informed approach to healthcare. Furthermore,\\nthis technology can be used to create personalized visualizations that cater to the specific needs and\\npreferences of individual patients, promoting a more patient-centric approach to medical care.\\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge the potential risks and challenges associated with the use of\\nneural style transfer in medical imaging. For instance, the stylization process can introduce artifacts\\nor distortions that may compromise the accuracy of diagnoses, highlighting the need for rigorous\\nvalidation and testing of these technologies. Moreover, the use of neural style transfer in medical\\nimaging raises important questions about the role of aesthetics in healthcare, and whether the pursuit\\nof visually appealing images may compromise the primacy of medical accuracy and objectivity.\\nIn a bizarre twist, researchers have also explored the application of neural style transfer in medical\\nvisualization using entirely unconventional sources of inspiration, such as the works of renowned\\nartists like Salvador Dali and Rene Magritte. By incorporating the surrealist principles of these\\nartists into medical imaging, researchers aim to create dreamlike visualizations that reveal hidden\\npatterns and relationships within medical data.

       "  'file_content': 'Subspace Constraint Method of Feature Tracking\\nAbstract\\nFeature tracking in video is a crucial task in computer vision. Usually, the tracking\\nproblem is handled one feature at a time, using a single-feature tracker like the\\nKanade-Lucas-Tomasi algorithm, or one of its derivatives. While this approach\\nworks quite well when dealing with high- quality video and “strong” features, it\\noften falters when faced with dark and noisy video containing low-quality features.\\nWe present a framework for jointly tracking a set of features, which enables sharing\\ninformation between the different features in the scene. We show that our method\\ncan be employed to track features for both rigid and non- rigid motions (possibly\\nof few moving bodies) even when some features are occluded. Furthermore, it can\\nbe used to significantly improve tracking results in poorly-lit scenes (where there\\nis a mix of good and bad features). Our approach does not require direct modeling\\nof the structure or the motion of the scene, and runs in real time on a single CPU\\ncore.\\n1 Introduction\\nFeature tracking in video is an important computer vision task, often used as the first step in finding\\nstructure from motion or simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM). The celebrated Kanade-Lucas-\\nTomasi algorithm tracks feature points by searching for matches between templates representing\\neach feature and a frame of video. Despite many other alternatives and improvement, it is still one\\nof the best video feature tracking algorithms. However, there are several realistic scenarios when\\nLucas-Kanade and many of its alternatives do not perform well: poor lighting conditions, noisy video,\\nand when there are transient occlusions that need to be ignored. In order to deal with such scenarios\\nmore robustly it would be useful to allow the feature points to communicate with each other to decide\\nhow they should move as a group, so as to respect the underlying three dimensional geometry of the\\nscene.\\nThis underlying geometry constrains the trajectories of the track points to have a low-rank structure\\nfor the case when tracking a single rigid object under an affine camera model, and for non-rigid\\nmotion and the perspective camera. In this work we will combine the low-rank geometry of the\\ncohort of tracked features with the successful non-linear single feature tracking framework of Lucas\\nand Kanade by adding a low-rank regularization penalty in the tracking optimization problem. To\\naccommodate dynamic scenes with non-trivial motion we apply our rank constraint over a sliding\\nwindow, so that we only consider a small number of frames at a given time (this is a common idea\\nfor dealing with non-rigid motions). We demonstrate very strong performance in rigid environments\\nas well as in scenes with multiple and/or non- rigid motion (since the trajectories of all features are\\nstill low rank for short time intervals). We describe experiments with several choices of low-rank\\nregularizers (which are local in time), using a unified optimization framework that allows real time\\nregularized tracking on a single CPU core.\\n2 On Low-Rank Feature Trajectories\\nUnder the affine camera model, the feature trajectories for a set of features from a rigid body should\\nexist in an affine subspace of dimension 3, or a linear subspace of dimension 4. However, subspaces\\n.corresponding to very degenerate motion are lower-dimensional those corresponding to general\\nmotion.\\nFeature trajectories of non-rigid scenarios exhibit significant variety, but some low-rank models\\nmay still be successfully applied to them. we consider a sliding temporal window, where over\\nshort durations the motion is simple and the feature trajectories are of lower rank. The restriction\\non the length of feature trajectories can also help in satisfying an approximate local affine camera\\nmodel in scenes which violate the affine camera model. In general, depth disparities give rise to\\nlow-dimensional manifolds which are only locally approximated by linear spaces.\\nAt last, even in the case of multiple moving rigid objects, the set of trajectories is still low rank\\n(confined to the union of a few low rank subspaces). In all of these scenarios the low rank is unknown\\nin general.\\n3 Feature Tracking\\nNotation: A feature at a location z1 ∈ R2 in a given N1 × N2 frame of an N1 × N2 × N3 video is\\ncharacterized by a template T, which is an n × n sub-image of that frame centered at z1 (n is a small\\ninteger, generally taken to be odd, so the template has a center pixel). If z1 does not have integer\\ncoordinates, T is interpolated from the image. We denote Ω = 1, ..., n × 1, ..., n and we parametrize T\\nso that its pixel values are obtained by T(u)u∈Ω.\\nA classical formulation of the single-feature tracking problem is to search for the translation x1 that\\nminimizes some distance between a feature’s template T at a given frame and the next frame of video\\ntranslated by x1; we denote this next frame by I. That is, we minimize the single-feature energy\\nfunction c(x1):\\nc(x1) = 1\\n2\\nX\\nu∈Ω\\nψ(T(u) − I(u + x1))\\nwhere, for example, ψ(x) = |x| or ψ(x) = x2. To apply continuous optimization we view x1 as a\\ncontinuous variable and we thus view T and I as functions over continuous domains (implemented\\nwith bi-linear interpolation).\\n3.1 Low Rank Regularization Framework\\nIf we want to encourage a low rank structure in the trajectories, we cannot view the tracking of\\ndifferent features as separate problems. For f ∈ 1, 2, ..., F, let xf denote the position of feature f in\\nthe current frame (in image coordinates), and let x = (x1, x2, ..., xF ) ∈ R2F denote the joint state of\\nall features in the scene. We define the total energy function as follows:\\nC(x) = 1\\nFn2\\nFX\\nf=1\\nX\\nu∈Ω\\nψ(Tf (u) − I(u + xf ))\\nwhere Tf (u) is the template for feature f. Now, we can impose desired relationships between features\\nin a scene by imposing constraints on the domain of optimization.\\nInstead of enforcing a hard constraint, we add a penalty term to, which increases the cost of states\\nwhich are inconsistent with low-rank motion. Specifically, we define:\\nC(x) = α\\nFX\\nf=1\\nX\\nu∈Ω\\nψ(Tf (u) − I(u + xf )) + P(x)\\nwhere P(x) is an estimate of, or proxy for, the dimensionality of the set of feature trajectories over the\\nlast several frames of video (past feature locations are treated as constants, so this is a function only\\nof the current state, x). Notice that we have replaced the scale factor 1/(F n2) from with the constant\\nα, as this coefficient is now also responsible for controlling the relative strength of the penalty term.\\nWe will give explicit examples for P in section 3.2.\\nThis framework gives rise to two different solutions, characterized by the strength of the penalty\\nterm (definition of α). Each has useful, real-world tracking applications. In the first case, we assume\\n2that most (but not necessarily all) features in the scene approximately obey a low rank model. This\\nis appropriate if the scene contains non-rigid or multiple moving bodies. We can impose a weak\\nconstraint by making the penalty term small relative to the other terms. If a feature is strong, it will\\nconfidently track the imagery, ignoring the constraint (regardless of whether the motion is consistent\\nwith the other features in the scene). If a feature is weak in the sense that we cannot fully determine\\nits true location by only looking at the imagery, then the penalty term will become significant and\\nencourage the feature to agree with the motion of the other features in the scene.\\nIn the second case, we assume that all features in the scene are supposed to agree with a low rank\\nmodel (and deviations from that model are indicative of tracking errors). We can impose a strong\\nconstraint by making the penalty term large relative to the other terms. No small set of features can\\noverpower the constraint, regardless of how strong the features are. This forces all features to move is\\na way that is consistent with a simple motion. Thus, a small number of features can even be occluded,\\nand their positions will be predicted by the motion of the other features in the scene.\\n3.2 Specific Choices of the Low-Rank Regularizer\\nThere is now a large body of work on low rank regularization. We will restrict ourselves to showing\\nresults using three choices for P described below. Each choice we present defines P(x) in terms\\nof a matrix M. It is the 2(L + 1) × F matrix whose column f contains the feature trajectory for\\nfeature f within a sliding window of L + 1 consecutive frames (current frame and L past frames).\\nSpecifically, M = [mi,j], where (m0,f , m1,f )T is the current (variable) position of feature f and\\n(m2l+1,f , m2l+2,f )T , l = 1, ..., L contains the x and y pixel coordinates of feature f from l frames\\nin the past (past feature locations are treated as known constants). One may alternatively center the\\ncolumns of M by subtracting from each column the average of all columns. Most constraints derived\\nfor trajectories actually confine trajectories to a low rank affine subspace (as opposed to a linear\\nsubspace). Centering the columns of M transforms an affine constraint into a linear one. Alternatively,\\none can forgo centering and view an affine constraint as a linear constraint in one dimension higher.\\nWe report results for both approaches.\\n3.2.1 Explicit Factorizations\\nA simple method for enforcing the structure constraint is to write M = BC, where B is a 2(L+1)×d\\nmatrix, and C is a d × F matrix. However, as mentioned in the previous section, because the feature\\ntracks often do not lie exactly on a subspace due to deviations from the camera model or non- rigidity,\\nan explicit constraint of this form is not suitable.\\nHowever, an explicit factorization can be used in a penalty term by measuring the deviation of M, in\\nsome norm, from its approximate low rank factorization. For example, if we let\\nM = UΣV T\\ndenote the SVD of M, we can take P(x) to be ||BC M||, where B is the first three or four columns of U,\\nand C is the first three or four rows of V T . Then this P corresponds to penalizing M via PF\\ni=d+1 σi,\\nwhere σi = λii is the ith singular value of M. As above, since the history is fixed, U, Σ, and V T are\\nfunctions of x.\\nThis approach assumes knowledge of the low-rank d. For simplicity, we assume a local rigid model\\nand thus set d = 3 when centering M and d = 4 when not centering.\\n3.2.2 Nuclear Norm\\nA popular alternative to explicitly keeping track of the best fit low-dimensional subspace to M is to\\nuse the matrix nuclear norm and define\\nP(x) = ||M||∗ = ||σ||1\\nThis is a convex proxy for the rank of M. Here σ = (σ1 σ2 . . . σ2(L+1)∧F )T is the vector of singular\\nvalues of M, and || · ||1 is the l1 norm. Unlike explicit factorization, where only energy outside the first\\nd principal components of M is punished, the nuclear norm will favor lower-rank M over higher-rank\\nM even when both matrices have rank d. Thus, using this kind of penalty will favor simpler track\\npoint motions over more complex ones, even when both are technically permissible.\\n33.2.3 Empirical Dimension\\nEmpirical Dimension refers to a class of dimension estimators depending on a parameter ϵ ∈ (0,1].\\nThe empirical dimension of M is defined to be:\\ndϵ(M) = ||σ||ϵ\\n1\\n||σ||ϵϵ\\nNotice that we use norm notation, although ||· ||ϵ is only a pseudo-norm. When ϵ = 1, this is sometimes\\ncalled the “effective rank” of the data matrix.\\nEmpirical dimension satisfies a few important properties. First, empirical dimension is invariant\\nunder rotation and scaling of a data set. Additionally, in the absence of noise, empirical dimension\\nnever exceeds true dimension, but it approaches true dimension as the number of measurements goes\\nto infinity for spherically symmetric distributions. Thus, dϵ is a true dimension estimator (whereas\\nthe nuclear norm is a proxy for dimension). To use empirical dimension as our regularizer, we define\\nP(x) = dϵ(M).\\nEmpirical dimension is governed by its parameter, ϵ. An ϵ near 0 results in a “strict” estimator, which\\nis appropriate for estimating dimension in situations where you have little noise and you expect your\\ndata to live in true linear spaces. If ϵ is near 1 then dϵ is a lenient estimator. This makes it less\\nsensitive to noise, and more tolerant of data sets that are only approximately linear. In all of the\\nexperiments we present, we use ϵ = 0.6, although we found that other tested values also worked well.\\n3.3 Implementation Details\\nWe fix L = 10 for the sliding window and let (x) = |x|. We use this form for so that all terms in the total\\nenergy function behave linearly in a known range of values. If our fit terms behaved quadratically,\\nit would be more challenging to balance them against a penalty term. We also tested a Huber loss\\nfunction for and have concluded that such a regularization is not needed.\\nWe fix a parameter m for each penalty form (selected empirically - see the supplementary material\\nfor our procedure), which determines the strength of the penalty. The weak and strong regularization\\nparameters are set as follows:\\nαweak = 1\\nmn2 and αstrong = 1\\nmF n2\\nThe weak scaling implies that a perfectly-matched feature will contribute 0 to the total energy, and a\\npoorly-matched feature will contribute an amount on the order of 1/m to the total energy. The penalty\\nterm will contribute on the order of 1 to the total energy. Since we do not divide the contributions of\\neach feature by the number of features, the penalty terms contribution is comparable in magnitude to\\nthat of a single feature. The strong scaling implies that the penalty term is on the same scale as the\\nsum of the contributions of all of the features in the scene.\\n3.3.1 Minimization Strategy\\nThe total energy function we propose for constrained tracking is non-convex since the contributions\\nfrom the template fit terms are not convex (even if P is convex); this is also the case with other feature\\ntracking methods, including the Lucas-Kanade tracker. We employ a 1st-order descent approach for\\ndriving the energy to a local minimum.\\nTo reduce the computational load of feature tracking, some trackers use 2nd-order methods for\\noptimization. This works well when tracking strong features, but in our experience it can be\\nunreliable when dealing with weak or ambiguous features. Since we are explicitly trying to improve\\ntracking accuracy on poor features we opt for a 1st-order descent approach instead.\\nThe simplest 1st-order descent method is (sub)gradient descent. Unfortunately, because there can be\\na very large difference in magnitude between the contributions of strong and weak features to our\\ntotal energy, our problem is not well-conditioned. If we pursue standard gradient descent, the strong\\nfeatures dictate the step direction and the weak features have very little effect on it. Ideally, once the\\nstrong features are correctly positioned, they will no longer dominate the step direction. If we were\\nable to perfectly measure the gradient of our objective function, this would be the case. In practice,\\nthe error in our numerical gradient estimate can be large enough to prevent the strong features from\\n4ever relinquishing control over the step direction. The result is that in a scene with both very strong\\nand very weak features, the weak features may not be tracked.\\nTo remedy this, we compute our step direction by blending the gradient of the energy function with a\\nvector that corresponds to taking equal-sized gradient descent steps separately for each feature. We\\nuse a fast line search in each iteration to find the nearest local minimum in the step direction. This\\ncompromise approach allows for efficient descent while ensuring that each feature has some control\\nover the step direction (regardless of feature strength).\\nBecause the energy is not convex, it is important to choose a good initial state. We use a combination\\nof two strategies to initialize the tracking: first, we generate our initial guess of x by registering an\\nentire frame of video with the previous (at lower resolution). Secondly, we use multi-resolution, or\\npyramidal tracking so that approximate motion on a large scale can help us get close to the minimum\\nbefore we try tracking on finer resolution levels.\\nWe now explain the details of the algorithm. Let I denote a full new frame of video and let xprev be\\nthe concatenation of feature positions in the previous frame. We form a pyramid for I where level 0\\nis the full-resolution image and each higher level m (1 through 3) has half the vertical and half the\\nhorizontal resolution of level m 1. To initialize the optimization, we take the full frame (at resolution\\nlevel 3) and register it against the previous frame (also at resolution level 3) using gradient descent\\nand an absolute value loss function. We initialize each features position in the current frame by taking\\nits position in the previous frame and adding the offset between the frames, as found through this\\nregistration process). Once we have our initial x, we begin optimization on the top pyramid level.\\nWhen done on the top level, we use the result to initialize optimization on the level below it, and\\nso on until we have found a local minimum on level 0. On any given pyramid level, we perform\\noptimization by iteratively computing a step direction and conducting a fast line search to find a local\\nminimum in the search direction. We impose a minimum and maximum on the number of steps to be\\nperformed on each level (mini and maxi, respectively). Our termination condition (on a given level)\\nis when the magnitude of the derivative of C is not significantly smaller than it was in the previous\\nstep. To compute our search direction in each step, we first compute the gradient of C (which we will\\ncall DC) and set a =\\nThis is done by breaking it into a collection of 2-vectors (elements 1 and 2 are together, elements\\n3 and 4 are together, and so on) and normalizing each of them. We then recombine the normalized\\n2-vectors to get b. We blend a with c to compute our step direction. Algorithm 1 summarizes the full\\nprocess.\\n3.3.2 Efficiency and Complexity\\nWe have found that our algorithm typically converges in about 20 iterations or less at each pyramid\\nlevel (with fewer iterations on lower pyramid levels). In our experiments, we used a resolution\\nof 640-by-480 (we have also done tests at 1000 × 562), and we found that 4 pyramid levels were\\nsufficient for reliable tracking. Thus, on average, less than 80 iterations are required to track from\\none frame to the next. A single iteration requires one gradient evaluation and multiple evaluations\\nof C. The complexity of a gradient evaluation is k1F n2 + k2LF2, and the complexity of an energy\\nevaluation is k3F n2 + k4L2F. Our C++ implementation (which makes use of OpenCV) can run\\non 35 features of size 7-by-7 with a temporal window of 6 frames (L = 5) on a 3rd-generation\\nIntel i5 CPU at approximately 16 frames per second. SIMD instructions are used in places, but no\\nmulti-threading was used, so faster processing rates are possible. With a larger window of L = 10 our\\nalgorithm still runs at 2-5 frames per second.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo evaluate our method, we conducted tests on several real video sequences in circumstances that are\\ndifficult for feature tracking. These included shaky footage in low-light environments. The resulting\\nvideos contained dark regions with few good features and the unsteady camera motion and poor\\nlighting introduced time-varying motion blur.\\nIn these video sequences it proved very difficult to hand-register features for ground-truth. In order to\\npresent a quantitative numerical comparison we also collected higher-quality video sequences and\\nsynthetically degraded their quality. We used a standard Lucas-Kanade tracker on the non-degraded\\n5videos to generate ground-truth (the output was human-verified and corrected). We therefore present\\nqualitative results on real, low-quality video sequences, as well as quantitative results on a set of\\nsynthetically degraded videos.\\n4.1 Qualitative Experiments on Real Videos\\nIn our tests on real video sequences containing low- quality features, single-feature tracking does\\nnot provide acceptable results. When following a non-distinctive feature, the single-feature energy\\nfunction often flattens out in one or more directions. A tracker may move in any ambiguous direction\\nwithout realizing a better or worse match with the features template. This results in the tracked\\nlocation drifting away from a features true location (i.e. “wandering”). This is not a technical\\nlimitation of one particular tracking implementation. Rather, it is a fundamental problem due to the\\nfact that the local imagery in a small neighborhood of a feature does not always contain enough\\ninformation to deduce the features motion between frames. This claim can be verified by attempting\\n6'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'A Chinese Span-Extraction Dataset for Machine\\nReading Comprehension\\nAbstract\\nThis paper introduces a novel dataset for Chinese machine reading comprehension,\\nfocusing on span extraction. The data set is constructed using roughly 20,000 real-\\nworld questions that are annotated by experts on passages extracted from Wikipedia.\\nA challenge set is also created with questions that demand a deep understanding\\nand inference across multiple sentences. We also show several baseline models and\\nanonymous submission scores to emphasize the challenges present in this dataset.\\nThe release of this dataset facilitated the Second Evaluation Workshop on Chinese\\nMachine Reading Comprehension, also called CMRC 2018. We anticipate that this\\ndataset will further facilitate research in Chinese machine reading comprehension.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe capacity to interpret and comprehend natural language is a crucial component of achieving\\nadvanced artificial intelligence. Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is designed to understand\\nthe context of given texts and respond to related questions. Numerous types of MRC datasets have\\nbeen developed, such as cloze-style reading comprehension, span-extraction reading comprehension,\\nopen-domain reading comprehension, and multiple-choice reading comprehension. Along with the\\nincreasing availability of reading comprehension datasets, several neural network methods have been\\nproposed, leading to substantial advancements in this area.\\nThere have also been various efforts to create Chinese machine reading comprehension datasets.\\nIn cloze-style reading comprehension, a Chinese cloze-style reading comprehension dataset was\\nproposed, namely People’s Daily Children’s Fairy Tale. To increase the difficulty of the dataset, they\\nalso release a human-annotated evaluation set in addition to the automatically generated development\\nand test sets. Later, another dataset was introduced using children’s reading materials. To promote\\ndiversity and explore transfer learning, they also offer a human-annotated evaluation dataset using\\nmore natural queries compared to the cloze type. This dataset was the main component in the first\\nevaluation workshop on Chinese machine reading comprehension (CMRC 2017). Furthermore, a\\nlarge-scale open-domain Chinese machine reading comprehension dataset (DuReader) was created,\\ncontaining 200k queries from search engine user query logs. There is also a reading comprehension\\ndataset in Traditional Chinese.\\nWhile current machine learning techniques have outperformed human-level performance on datasets\\nlike SQuAD, it is still unclear whether similar results can be achieved on datasets using different\\nlanguages. To accelerate the progress of machine reading comprehension research, we present a\\nspan-extraction dataset tailored for Chinese.\\n2 The Proposed Dataset\\n2.1 Task Definition\\nThe reading comprehension task can be described as a triple (P, Q, A), where P is the passage, Q\\nrepresents the question, and A is the answer. Specifically, in span-extraction reading comprehension,questions are created by humans which is a more natural way of creating data than the cloze-style\\nMRC datasets. The answer A should consist of a specific span from the given passage P. The task can\\nbe simplified by predicting the start and end indices of the answer within the passage.\\n2.2 Data Pre-Processing\\nWe downloaded the Chinese portion of Wikipedia from a specified date and used an open-source\\ntoolkit to process the raw files into plain text. Additionally, the Traditional Chinese characters were\\nconverted to Simplified Chinese to ensure consistency using another open-source tool.\\n2.3 Human Annotation\\nThe questions in this dataset were created entirely by human experts, setting it apart from prior works\\nthat relied on automated data generation methods. Initially, documents are divided into passages,\\neach containing no more than 500 Chinese words. Annotators are required to assess each passage for\\nits suitability, discarding those that are too difficult for public understanding. Passages were discarded\\nbased on the following rules:\\n• If more than 30% of the passage consists of non-Chinese characters.\\n• If the passage includes too many specialized or professional terms.\\n• If the passage has a large number of special characters or symbols.\\n• If the paragraph is written in classical Chinese.\\nAfter determining that the passage is suitable, annotators generate questions and their corresponding\\nprimary answers based on the provided passage. During this question annotation, the following rules\\nare used.\\n• Each passage should have no more than five questions.\\n• Answers must be a span from the passage.\\n• Question diversity is encouraged such as questions of type who, when, where, why, and\\nhow.\\n• Avoid copying descriptions from the passage directly. Use paraphrasing or syntax transfor-\\nmations to make answering more difficult.\\n• Long answers (over 30 characters) will be discarded.\\nFor the evaluation sets, which include the development, test, and challenge sets, three answers are\\navailable for a more thorough assessment. Besides the primary answer generated by the question\\nproposer, two additional annotators write a second and third answer for each question. These\\nadditional annotators do not see the primary answer to avoid biased answers.\\n2.4 Challenge Set\\nA challenge set was made to evaluate how effectively models can perform reasoning over diverse\\nclues in the context, while still maintaining the span-extraction format. This annotation was also\\ncompleted by three annotators. The questions in this set need to meet the following criteria:\\n• The answer can not be deduced from a single sentence in the passage if the answer is a\\nsingle word or a short phrase. The annotation should encourage asking complex questions\\nthat need an overall view of the passage to answer correctly.\\n• If the answer is a named entity or belongs to a particular genre, it cannot be the only instance\\nin the passage. There should be more than one instance to make the correct choice more\\ndifficult for the model.\\n2.5 Statistics\\nThe overall statistics of the pre-processed data are shown in Table 1. The distribution of question\\ntypes in the development set is shown in Figure 2.\\n2Table 1: Statistics of the CMRC 2018 dataset.\\nTrain Dev Test Challenge\\nQuestion # 10,321 3,351 4,895 504\\nAnswer # per query 1 3 3 3\\nMax passage tokens 962 961 980 916\\nMax question tokens 89 56 50 47\\nMax answer tokens 100 85 92 77\\nAvg passage tokens 452 469 472 464\\nAvg question tokens 15 15 15 18\\nAvg answer tokens 17 9 9 19\\n3 Evaluation Metrics\\nThis paper uses two evaluation metrics. Common punctuations and white spaces are ignored for\\nnormalization during evaluation.\\n3.1 Exact Match\\nThe Exact Match (EM) score measures the exact overlap between the prediction and the ground truth\\nanswer. If the match is exact, then the score is 1; otherwise, the score is 0.\\n3.2 F1-Score\\nThe F1-score evaluates the fuzzy overlap at the character level between the prediction and the ground\\ntruth answers. Instead of treating the answers as a bag of words, we calculate the longest common\\nsequence (LCS) between the prediction and the ground truth and then compute the F1-score. The\\nmaximum F1 score among all the ground truth answers is taken for each question.\\n3.3 Estimated Human Performance\\nThe estimated human performance is computed to measure the difficulty of the proposed dataset.\\nEach question in the development, test, and challenge set has three answers. We use a cross-validation\\nmethod to compute the performance. We treat the first answer as a human prediction and consider the\\nother two answers as ground truth. Using this process, three human prediction scores are generated.\\nFinally, we calculate the average of these three scores as the estimated human performance.\\n4 Experimental Results\\n4.1 Baseline System\\nWe use BERT as the foundation of our baseline system. We modified the original script to accommo-\\ndate our dataset. The initial learning rate was set to 3e-5, with a batch size of 32, and the training\\nwas conducted for two epochs. The document and query maximum lengths were set to 512 and 64\\nrespectively.\\n4.2 Results\\nThe results are in Table 2. Besides the baseline results, we include the results of the participants\\nin the CMRC 2018 evaluation. The training and development sets were released to the public, and\\nsubmissions were accepted to evaluate the models on the hidden test and challenge sets. As we can\\nsee that most of the participants achieved an F1 score above 80 in the test set. On the other hand, the\\nEM metric shows considerably lower scores in comparison to the SQuAD dataset, highlighting that\\ndetermining the precise span boundary is crucial for performance enhancement in Chinese reading\\ncomprehension.\\nAs shown in the last column of Table 2, the top-ranked systems achieve decent results on the\\ndevelopment and test sets but struggle to give satisfactory results on the challenge set.

This shows there are still potential challenges in\\ncreating models that can perform well on difficult reasoning questions. We expect that this dataset\\nwill contribute to linguistic diversity in machine reading comprehension and facilitate additional\\nresearch on questions that require comprehensive reasoning across multiple clues.\\n4'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Improving Model Generalization Using a Single Data\\nSample for Semantic Adaptation\\nAbstract\\nThe limited capacity of deep networks to generalize beyond their training dis-\\ntribution presents a significant challenge in semantic segmentation. Traditional\\napproaches have operated under the assumption of a fixed model post-training,\\nwith parameters remaining constant during testing. This research introduces a\\nself-adaptive methodology for semantic segmentation that modifies the inference\\nmechanism to accommodate each input sample individually. This adaptation in-\\nvolves two principal operations. First, it refines the parameters of convolutional\\nlayers based on the input image, employing a consistency-based regularization.\\nSecond, it modifies the Batch Normalization layers by dynamically blending the\\ntraining distribution with a reference distribution extracted from a single test sam-\\nple. Although these techniques are individually recognized in the field, their\\ncombined application establishes new benchmarks in accuracy for generalization\\nfrom synthetic to real-world data. The empirical evidence from this study indicates\\nthat self-adaptation can effectively enhance deep network generalization to out-\\nof-domain data, serving as a valuable complement to the established methods of\\nmodel regularization during training.\\n1 Introduction\\nState-of-the-art models in semantic segmentation exhibit a notable deficiency in robustness when\\nconfronted with out-of-distribution data, where the distributions of training and testing sets diverge.\\nWhile numerous studies have examined this challenge, with a predominant focus on image classifica-\\ntion, it has been observed that Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM), which presumes independent and\\nidentically distributed training and testing samples, remains remarkably competitive. This contrasts\\nwith the evident advancements in domain adaptation for both image classification and semantic\\nsegmentation. The domain adaptation setup, however, typically requires access to an unlabeled\\ntest distribution during training. In the generalization scenario considered here, only a single test\\nsample is accessible during inference, and no information sharing must occur between subsequent\\ntest samples.\\nThis study investigates the generalization challenge in semantic segmentation, specifically from\\nsynthetic data to real-world scenarios, by employing an adaptive approach. Unlike prior research\\nthat has concentrated on modifying model architecture or training procedures, this work revises the\\nstandard inference procedure using a technique derived from domain adaptation methods. Termed\\nself-adaptation, this technique utilizes a self-supervised loss function to facilitate adaptation to\\nindividual test samples through a limited number of parameter updates. In addition to these loss-based\\nupdates, self-adaptation incorporates feature statistics from the training data with those of the test\\nsample within the Batch Normalization layers.\\n2 Related Work\\nThis research contributes to the ongoing investigation into the generalization capabilities of semantic\\nsegmentation models and is related to explorations of feature normalization and online learning.\\n.In contrast to previous studies that focused on training strategies and model design, this study\\nspecifically examines the inference process during test time. Prior research has attempted to improve\\ngeneralization by augmenting synthetic training data with styles transferred from real images, or\\nby utilizing a classification model trained on real images to ensure feature proximity between\\nmodels via distillation, often seeking layer-specific learning rates. Some approaches have added\\ninstance normalization (IN) layers heuristically to the network. Recent studies have sought to extract\\ndomain-invariant feature statistics through instance-selective whitening loss or frequency-based\\ndomain randomization. Others have aimed to learn style-invariant representations using causal\\nframeworks or have augmented single-domain data to simulate a multi-source scenario to increase\\nsource domain diversity. Some techniques involve swapping channel-wise statistics in feature\\nnormalization layers and learning adapter functions to adjust the mean and variance based on the\\ninput. Another method enforces consistency of output logits across multiple images of the same class.\\nTo improve generalization in federated learning, researchers have explored training clients locally\\nwith sharpness-aware minimization and averaging stochastic weights. However, these methods either\\nassume access to a distribution of real images during training or require modifications to the network\\narchitecture. The technique presented in this work does not require either, making it applicable\\npost-hoc to already trained models to improve their generalization.\\nBatch Normalization (BN) and other normalization techniques have been increasingly associated\\nwith model robustness. The most common methods, including BN, Layer Normalization (LN), and\\nInstance Normalization (IN), also impact the model’s expressive capacity, which can be further\\nimproved by combining these techniques within a single architecture. In domain adaptation, some\\nstudies use source-domain statistics during training and replace them with target-domain statistics\\nduring inference. Recent work has explored combining source and target statistics during inference,\\nweighted by the number of samples they aggregate. Others propose using batch statistics from the\\ntarget domain during inference instead of training statistics from the source domain. This study\\ncomplements these findings by demonstrating improved generalization of semantic segmentation\\nmodels.\\nSeveral previous studies have updated model parameters during inference, particularly in object\\ntracking where the object detector must adapt to the changing appearance of the tracked instance.\\nConditional generative models have been employed to learn from single image samples for super-\\nresolution and scene synthesis. Recently, this principle has been extended to improve the robustness\\nof image classification models, though the self-supervised tasks developed for image classification do\\nnot always extend well to dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. Recent research has\\nproposed more suitable alternatives for self-supervised loss in domain adaptation, and several works\\nhave developed domain-specific approaches for medical imaging or first-person vision.\\nMost of the related works focus on domain adaptation in image classification, typically assuming\\naccess to multiple samples from the target distribution during training. This work addresses semantic\\nsegmentation in the domain generalization setting, requiring only a single datum from the test set. In\\nthis context, simple objectives like entropy minimization improve baseline accuracy only moderately.\\nIn contrast, the self-adaptation method presented here, which uses pseudo-labels to account for\\nprediction uncertainty, proves significantly more effective. The task is distinct from few-shot learning,\\nwhere the model may adapt during testing using a small annotated set of samples. Here, no such\\nannotation is available; the model adjusts to the test sample in an unsupervised manner, without\\nrequiring proxy tasks or prior knowledge of the test distribution.\\n3 Methodology\\nIn traditional inference, the parameters of the segmentation model are assumed to remain fixed. In\\ncontrast, adaptive systems are capable of learning to specialize to their environment. Analogously,\\nthis study allows the segmentation model to update its parameters during inference. It is important to\\nnote that this setup differs from domain adaptation scenarios, as the updated parameters are discarded\\nafter processing each sample, aligning with the principles of domain generalization.\\nThe proposed approach creates mini-batches of images for each test sample using data augmentation.\\nStarting with the original test image, a set of N augmented images is generated through multi-scaling,\\nhorizontal flipping, and grayscaling. These images form a mini-batch that is processed by the CNN.\\nThe resulting softmax probabilities are transformed back to the original pixel space using inverse\\n2affine transformations, producing multiple predictions for each pixel. The mean of these probabilities\\nis computed along the mini-batch dimension for each class and pixel on the spatial grid.\\nA threshold value is computed from the maximum probability of every class to create a class-\\ndependent threshold. For each pixel, the class with the highest probability is extracted. Low-\\nconfidence predictions are ignored by setting pixels with a softmax probability below the threshold to\\nan ignore label, while the remaining pixels use the dominant class as the pseudo-label. This pseudo\\nground truth is used to fine-tune the model for a set number of iterations using gradient descent with\\nthe cross-entropy loss. After this self-adaptation process, a single final prediction is produced using\\nthe updated model weights. The weights are then reset to their initial values before processing the\\nnext test sample, ensuring that the model does not accumulate knowledge about the entire target data\\ndistribution.\\nBatch Normalization (BN) has become an integral part of modern CNNs. Although originally\\ndesigned to improve training convergence, it is now recognized for its role in model robustness,\\nincluding domain generalization. During training, BN computes the mean and standard deviation\\nacross the batch and spatial dimensions. The normalized features are derived using these statistics.\\nAt test time, it is common practice to normalize feature values with running estimates of the mean\\nand standard deviation across training batches, rather than using test-batch statistics. This is referred\\nto as train BN (t-BN).\\nIn the context of out-of-distribution generalization, the running statistics derived from the source data\\ncan differ substantially from those computed using target images, a problem known as covariate shift.\\nDomain adaptation methods often mitigate this issue by replacing source running statistics with those\\nof the target, a technique known as Adaptive Batch Normalization (AdaBN). Recent studies have\\nalso explored prediction-time BN (p-BN), which uses the statistics of the current test batch instead of\\nrunning statistics from training.\\nThis study assumes the availability of only a single target sample during inference. Alternatives like\\nAdaBN and p-BN are not directly applicable in this scenario. Instance Normalization (IN) layers\\ncould replace BN layers, but this might lead to covariate shift issues, as sample statistics may only\\napproximate the complete test distribution. Additionally, such a replacement could interfere with the\\nstatistics of activations in intermediate layers.\\nSelf-adaptive normalization (SaN) is proposed as a solution. It combines the inductive bias from\\nthe source domain’s running statistics with statistics extracted from a single test instance. The\\nsource mean and variance are averaged with sample statistics from the target domain, weighted by\\na parameter 1. This parameter represents the shift from the source domain ( 1 = 0) to a reference\\ndomain ( 1 = 1). During inference, new mean and variance are computed using this weighted average,\\nand these are used to normalize the features of the single test sample. This approach does not affect\\nthe behavior of BN layers during training and applies only during testing.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this study, the evaluation protocol is revised to adhere to principles of robustness and generalization.\\nThe supplier has access to two data distributions: the source data for model training and a validation\\nset for model validation. The generalization ability of the model is assessed on three distinct target\\nsets, providing an estimate of the expected model accuracy for out-of-distribution deployment. The\\ndatasets used are restricted to traffic scenes for compatibility with previous research.\\nSource data for model training comes from two synthetic datasets, GTA and SYNTHIA, which offer\\nlow-cost ground truth annotation and exhibit visual discrepancies with real imagery. The validation set\\nused is WildDash, which is understood to be of limited quantity but bears a closer visual resemblance\\nto potential target domains. The model is evaluated on three target domains: Cityscapes, BDD, and\\nIDD, chosen for their geographic diversity and differences in data acquisition. The average accuracy\\nacross these target domains estimates the expected model accuracy. Additionally, the Mapillary\\ndataset is used for comparison with previous works, although it does not disclose the geographic\\norigins of individual samples.\\nThe framework is implemented in PyTorch, and the baseline model is DeepLabv1 without CRF post-\\nprocessing. The models are trained on the source domains for 50 epochs using an SGD optimizer with\\na learning rate of 0.005, decayed polynomially. Data augmentation techniques include random-size\\n3crops, random aspect ratio adjustments, random horizontal flipping, color jitter, random blur, and\\ngrayscaling.\\nExperiments were conducted to investigate the influence of the parameter 1 in Self-adaptive Nor-\\nmalization (SaN) on segmentation accuracy and the Intersection over Union (IoU) for both source\\ndomains (GTA, SYNTHIA) and all main target domains (Cityscapes, BDD, IDD). The optimal 1 was\\ndetermined based on the IoU on the WildDash validation set. The segmentation accuracy with this\\noptimal 1 was reported, showing that SaN improves the mean IoU over both the established t-BN\\nbaseline and the more recent p-BN. The improvement was consistent across different backbone archi-\\ntectures and target domains. Additionally, model calibration, measured by the expected calibration\\nerror (ECE), was found to improve with SaN, which was competitive with the MC-Dropout method\\nand showed complementary effects when used jointly.\\nSelf-adaptation was compared to Test-Time Augmentation (TTA), which involves augmenting test\\nsamples with flipped and grayscaled versions at multiple scales and averaging the predictions. Self-\\nadaptation outperformed TTA by a clear margin, aligning with reported ECE scores and demonstrating\\nthat self-adaptation effectively uses calibrated confidence to generate reliable pseudo-labels.\\nSelf-adaptation was compared with state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, showing consis-\\ntent improvements over carefully tuned baselines, regardless of backbone architecture or source data.\\nThe method outperformed previous methods without modifying the model architecture or training\\nprocess, altering only the inference procedure.\\nA comparison with Tent, which also updates model parameters at test time but minimizes entropy\\ninstead of using pseudo-labels, showed that self-adaptation outperformed Tent substantially. This\\nwas demonstrated by training HRNet-W18 on GTA and comparing the IoU on Cityscapes, where\\nself-adaptation achieved a 7.5% improvement in IoU.\\nThe influence of the number of iterations for self-adaptation was investigated, showing that self-\\nadaptation balances accuracy and inference time by adjusting iteration numbers and layer choices.\\nIt was found to be more efficient and accurate than model ensembles. Self-adaptation can trade off\\naccuracy vs. runtime by using fewer update iterations or updating fewer upper network layers.\\nHyperparameter sensitivity analysis revealed that self-adaptation is robust to the choice of hyperpa-\\nrameters 1, 8, and 7. The optimal values were determined using the validation set, and the model\\naccuracy declined moderately with deviations from these values. Qualitative results showed that\\nself-adaptation improves segmentation quality and reduces pathological failure modes.\\nThe integration of self-adaptation with state-of-the-art architectures like DeepLabv3+, HRNet-W18,\\nHRNet-W48, and UPerNet with a Swin-T backbone demonstrated substantial improvements in\\nsegmentation accuracy across all target domains. Evaluation on the ACDC dataset, which includes\\nadverse weather conditions, showed that self-adaptation outperformed the baseline by 13.57% on\\naverage.\\nAdditional qualitative results and failure cases were discussed, showing that self-adaptation can\\nstruggle with cases of mislabeling regions with incorrect but semantically related classes. However,\\nthese failure cases were relatively rare, and the majority of image samples benefited from self-\\nadaptation, with accuracy improvements of up to 35% IoU compared to the baseline.\\n5 Results\\nThe empirical results demonstrate that self-adaptive normalization (SaN) consistently enhances\\nsegmentation accuracy in out-of-distribution scenarios. For instance, when training on the GTA\\ndataset and testing on Cityscapes, BDD, and IDD, SaN improved the mean IoU by 4.1% with ResNet-\\n50 and 5.1% with ResNet-101 compared to the t-BN baseline. Furthermore, SaN outperformed the\\nmore recent p-BN method, showing improvements irrespective of the backbone architecture and\\nthe target domain tested. In terms of calibration quality, measured by the expected calibration error\\n(ECE), SaN not only improved the baseline but also showed competitiveness with the MC-Dropout\\nmethod, even exhibiting complementary effects when both methods were combined.\\nSelf-adaptation was found to outperform traditional Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) across both\\nsource domains (GTA, SYNTHIA) and three target domains (Cityscapes, BDD, IDD). Despite TTA\\nimproving the baseline, self-adaptation provided a clear and consistent margin of 2.19% IoU on\\n4average. This aligns with the reported ECE scores, demonstrating that self-adaptation effectively\\nexploits the calibrated confidence of predictions to yield reliable pseudo-labels.\\nIn comparison to state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, self-adaptation showed substantial\\nimprovements even over carefully tuned baselines. It outperformed methods like DRPC and FSDR\\non most benchmarks, despite these methods using individual models for each target domain and\\nresorting to target domains for hyperparameter tuning. Self-adaptation achieved superior segmentation\\naccuracy without requiring access to a distribution of real images for training or modifying the model\\narchitecture, unlike previous methods such as ASG, CSG, DRPC, and IBN-Net.\\nThe study also compared self-adaptation with Tent, which updates model parameters at test time\\nby minimizing entropy. Self-adaptation, which constructs pseudo-labels based on well-calibrated\\npredictions, substantially outperformed Tent. Specifically, when training HRNet-W18 on GTA and\\nevaluating on Cityscapes, self-adaptation achieved a 7.5% improvement in IoU compared to Tent\\nunder a comparable computational budget.\\nFurther analysis revealed that self-adaptation provides a flexible mechanism for trading off accuracy\\nand runtime by varying the number of update iterations and the layers to adjust. It was found to be\\nmore efficient and accurate than model ensembles. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis indicated that\\nself-adaptation is robust to the choice of hyperparameters, with optimal values determined using the\\nvalidation set.\\nQualitative results demonstrated that self-adaptation visibly improves segmentation quality, reducing\\nartifacts and mislabeling compared to the baseline. The method’s effectiveness was consistent across\\ndifferent architectures, including DeepLabv3+, HRNet-W18, HRNet-W48, and UPerNet with a\\nSwin-T backbone, showing substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy on all target domains.\\n6 Conclusion\\nThe traditional learning principle of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) assumes independent and\\nidentically distributed training and testing data, which often results in models that are not robust to\\ndomain shifts. To address this, a self-adaptive inference process was introduced, bypassing the need\\nfor explicit assumptions about the test distribution. This study also outlined four principles for a\\nrigorous evaluation process in domain generalization, adhering to best practices in machine learning\\nresearch.\\nThe analysis demonstrated that even a single sample from the test domain can significantly improve\\nmodel predictions. The self-adaptive approach showed substantial accuracy improvements without\\naltering the training process or model architecture, unlike previous works. These results suggest\\nthat self-adaptive techniques could be valuable in other application domains, such as panoptic\\nsegmentation or monocular depth prediction.\\nWhile the presented self-adaptation method is not yet real-time, it offers a favorable trade-off between\\naccuracy and computational cost compared to model ensembles. Future research could explore\\nreducing the latency of self-adaptive inference through adaptive step sizes, higher-order optimization,\\nor low-precision computations. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of self-adaptation to\\nenhance model generalization and robustness in various applications.\\n5'},\n",

Our work builds upon this line of research,\\nfocusing specifically on the impact of CoT on in-context learning (ICL) of compositional functions,\\nparticularly within the context of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Previous studies have demonstrated\\nthe effectiveness of CoT in various tasks, such as question answering and commonsense reasoning [3,\\n4], but a comprehensive analysis of its influence on sample complexity and approximation power\\nwithin the framework of ICL remains relatively unexplored. This research aims to fill this gap\\nby providing a detailed investigation of CoT’s mechanisms and its implications for efficient LLM\\ntraining and deployment. We leverage both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeper\\nunderstanding of how CoT facilitates the learning of complex functions.\\nThe reduction of sample complexity is a crucial aspect of our investigation. While prior work has\\ntouched upon the potential of CoT to reduce the number of training examples needed [5], a systematic\\nanalysis of this effect across different function complexities and prompt lengths is lacking. Our\\nstudy addresses this by conducting extensive experiments to quantify the impact of CoT on sample\\ncomplexity, providing quantitative evidence of its efficiency gains. Furthermore, we explore the\\nrelationship between CoT prompt length and model performance, investigating the optimal balance\\nbetween detailed intermediate steps and computational efficiency. This analysis contributes to the\\ndevelopment of more effective and efficient CoT prompting strategies.\\nOur research also delves into the theoretical underpinnings of CoT’s success. Existing explanations\\noften focus on heuristic interpretations of CoT’s behavior [6], but a rigorous theoretical framework is\\nneeded to fully understand its impact on generalization and approximation power. We address this by\\ndeveloping a theoretical model that explains how CoT guides the model towards a more structured\\nand interpretable solution space, leading to improved generalization capabilities. This framework\\nprovides a deeper understanding of why CoT consistently outperforms standard ICL, particularly on\\ncomplex tasks requiring multiple reasoning steps. The theoretical insights offer valuable guidance for\\nthe design and optimization of CoT prompting strategies.\\nThe impact of CoT on the pretraining phase of LLM development is another critical area of our\\nresearch. While the benefits of pretraining are well-established [7], the specific role of CoT in en-\\nhancing pretraining efficiency and generalization remains largely unexplored. Our study investigates\\nwhether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficient learning during pretraining,\\nresulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. We posit that the decomposition\\ninherent in CoT allows the model to learn more robust and transferable representations, which are\\nless susceptible to overfitting and perform better on unseen data. This aspect is crucial for building\\nLLMs that can effectively generalize to a wide range of tasks and domains.\\nFinally, our work contrasts with previous research by focusing on the specific context of compo-\\nsitional functions and MLPs. While many studies have explored CoT in the context of natural\\n2language processing tasks, a detailed analysis of its impact on the learning of compositional functions\\nwithin a simpler, more controlled setting like MLPs provides valuable insights into the fundamental\\nmechanisms underlying CoT’s effectiveness. This allows us to isolate the effects of CoT from other\\nfactors that might influence performance in more complex NLP tasks. Our findings offer a more\\nnuanced understanding of CoT’s capabilities and limitations, paving the way for future research in\\nthis area.\\n3 Methodology\\nThis research employs a mixed-methods approach, combining theoretical analysis with empirical\\nexperimentation to investigate the mechanisms behind Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Our\\ntheoretical framework focuses on understanding how CoT’s decomposition of complex problems\\ninto simpler steps influences the learning process of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in the context\\nof in-context learning (ICL). We analyze how this decomposition affects the model’s ability to\\nlearn compositional functions, focusing on the impact on sample complexity and approximation\\npower. This theoretical analysis involves developing a mathematical model to capture the relationship\\nbetween CoT prompt length, function complexity, and model performance. We explore how the\\nstructured reasoning induced by CoT guides the model towards a more efficient and interpretable\\nsolution space, leading to improved generalization. The theoretical framework is designed to provide\\na principled explanation for the observed empirical results.\\nOur empirical investigation involves a series of experiments designed to validate our theoretical\\nhypotheses and quantify the effects of CoT. We use a range of MLP architectures and reasoning tasks\\nof varying complexity, systematically varying the number of training examples and the length of the\\nCoT prompts. For each experiment, we measure the model’s accuracy and compare the performance\\nof CoT prompting against standard ICL. The experiments are designed to assess the impact of CoT\\non sample complexity, measuring the reduction in the number of training examples required to\\nachieve a given level of accuracy. We also analyze the relationship between CoT prompt length and\\nmodel performance, identifying the optimal prompt length for different tasks and model architectures.\\nThe data collected from these experiments is used to validate our theoretical model and provide\\nquantitative evidence of CoT’s effectiveness.\\nThe datasets used in our experiments consist of synthetically generated data designed to represent\\ncompositional functions of varying complexity. This allows us to control the complexity of the tasks\\nand isolate the effects of CoT from other factors that might influence performance in more complex\\nreal-world datasets. The synthetic data is generated using a set of predefined rules, ensuring that the\\nfunctions are well-defined and their complexity can be precisely controlled. This approach allows for\\na more rigorous and controlled evaluation of CoT’s impact on sample complexity and approximation\\npower. We also explore the use of different prompting strategies, varying the level of guidance\\nprovided in the CoT prompts and the types of intermediate steps included.\\nThe evaluation metrics used in our experiments include accuracy, sample complexity (measured\\nas the number of training examples required to achieve a given accuracy level), and generalization\\nperformance (measured on a held-out test set). We use statistical tests, such as t-tests, to compare\\nthe performance of CoT prompting against standard ICL. The results are presented in tables and\\nfigures, showing the impact of CoT on each of the evaluation metrics across different experimental\\nconditions. The analysis of these results focuses on identifying the key factors that contribute to CoT’s\\neffectiveness and understanding the limitations of the approach. We also investigate the relationship\\nbetween the theoretical predictions of our model and the empirical results, assessing the validity and\\nrobustness of our theoretical framework.\\nFinally, we analyze the impact of CoT on the pretraining phase of LLM development. We inves-\\ntigate whether the structured reasoning facilitated by CoT leads to more efficient learning during\\npretraining, resulting in models with improved generalization capabilities. This involves comparing\\nthe performance of models pretrained with and without CoT on a range of downstream tasks. We\\nanalyze the learned representations of the models to understand how CoT influences the model’s\\ninternal representations and its ability to generalize to unseen data. The results of this analysis\\nprovide insights into the long-term benefits of incorporating CoT into the LLM training pipeline.\\nThis comprehensive approach allows us to gain a deep understanding of CoT’s mechanisms and its\\nimplications for efficient and effective LLM training and deployment.\\n34 Experiments\\nThis section details the experimental setup and results of our investigation into Chain-of-Thought\\n(CoT) prompting. We designed experiments to systematically evaluate CoT’s impact on sample\\ncomplexity, approximation power, and generalization ability in the context of in-context learning\\n(ICL) for multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) solving compositional functions. Our experiments involved\\nvarying the complexity of the target functions, the number of training examples provided, and the\\nlength of the CoT prompts. We compared the performance of models trained with CoT prompting\\nagainst those trained with standard ICL, using accuracy as the primary evaluation metric. The\\nexperiments were conducted using synthetic datasets to ensure controlled evaluation and precise\\nmanipulation of function complexity. We generated datasets with varying levels of noise to assess the\\nrobustness of CoT under different conditions. The MLP architectures used were carefully selected to\\nrepresent a range of model capacities, allowing us to investigate the scalability of CoT’s benefits. We\\nemployed rigorous statistical methods to ensure the reliability of our findings.\\nOur first set of experiments focused on sample complexity. We trained MLPs on compositional\\nfunctions of varying complexity, using different numbers of training examples and CoT prompt\\nlengths. The results consistently demonstrated that CoT significantly reduced the sample complexity\\ncompared to standard ICL. Figure 1 shows the relationship between the number of training examples\\nand accuracy for both CoT and ICL across different function complexities. As expected, CoT\\nconsistently outperformed ICL, requiring significantly fewer examples to achieve the same level of\\naccuracy, particularly for more complex functions. This reduction in sample complexity highlights\\nCoT’s efficiency in learning from limited data. Further analysis revealed a non-linear relationship\\nbetween CoT prompt length and sample complexity reduction, suggesting an optimal prompt length\\nexists for each task and model complexity. Excessively long prompts did not always lead to further\\nimprovements, indicating a potential trade-off between detail and computational cost.\\nFigure 1: Sample Complexity Comparison: CoT vs. ICL\\n[width=0.8]samplecomplexityplot.pd f\\nNext, we investigated CoT’s impact on approximation power. We evaluated the ability of models\\ntrained with and without CoT to accurately represent functions of increasing complexity. Table\\n1 summarizes the results. The table shows that CoT consistently improved the model’s ability to\\napproximate complex functions, achieving higher accuracy than ICL across all complexity levels.\\nThis suggests that CoT facilitates the learning of more intricate relationships within the data, enabling\\nthe model to capture the underlying structure of the compositional functions more effectively. The\\nimprovement was particularly pronounced for functions requiring multiple reasoning steps, further\\nsupporting the hypothesis that CoT enhances the model’s capacity for compositional reasoning.\\nTable 1: Approximation Power Comparison: CoT vs. ICL\\nFunction Complexity ICL Accuracy CoT Accuracy Improvement\\nLow 0.85 0.92 0.07\\nMedium 0.70 0.85 0.15\\nHigh 0.55 0.78 0.23\\nOur final set of experiments focused on generalization. We evaluated the performance of models\\ntrained with and without CoT on a held-out test set. The results showed that CoT led to significant\\nimprovements in generalization performance, indicating that the structured reasoning facilitated by\\nCoT promotes the learning of more robust and transferable representations. This enhanced gener-\\nalization ability is crucial for deploying models in real-world scenarios where the data distribution\\nmay differ from the training data. The improvement in generalization was consistent across different\\nfunction complexities and prompt lengths, suggesting that CoT’s benefits extend beyond specific task\\ncharacteristics. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that CoT enhances the model’s ability\\nto learn generalizable representations, leading to improved performance on unseen data. Further\\nanalysis revealed a correlation between the length of the CoT prompt and generalization performance,\\nwith longer prompts generally leading to better generalization, up to a certain point beyond which\\ndiminishing returns were observed.\\n4The overall results of our experiments strongly support the hypothesis that CoT prompting signif-\\nicantly enhances the performance of MLPs on compositional reasoning tasks. CoT consistently\\nimproved sample complexity, approximation power, and generalization ability, demonstrating its\\neffectiveness as a method for improving the efficiency and robustness of in-context learning. These\\nfindings have significant implications for the development and deployment of large language models,\\nsuggesting that CoT can be a valuable tool for improving the performance of these models on complex\\nreasoning tasks. Further research could explore the application of CoT to other model architectures\\nand task domains, as well as the development of more sophisticated prompting strategies.\\n5'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Joint Syntacto-Discourse Parsing and the\\nSyntacto-Discourse Treebank\\nAbstract\\nDiscourse parsing has long been treated as a stand-alone problem independent from\\nconstituency or dependency parsing. Most attempts at this problem are pipelined\\nrather than end-to-end, sophisticated, and not self-contained: they assume gold-\\nstandard text segmentations (Elementary Discourse Units), and use external parsers\\nfor syntactic features. In this paper we propose the first end-to-end discourse\\nparser that jointly parses in both syntax and discourse levels, as well as the first\\nsyntacto-discourse treebank by integrating the Penn Treebank with the RST Tree-\\nbank. Built upon our recent span-based constituency parser, this joint syntacto-\\ndiscourse parser requires no preprocessing whatsoever (such as segmentation or\\nfea- ture extraction), achieves the state-of-the- art end-to-end discourse parsing\\naccuracy.\\n1 Introduction\\nDistinguishing the semantic relations between segments in a document can be greatly beneficial to\\nmany high-level NLP tasks, such as summarization, sentiment analysis, question answering, and\\ntextual quality evaluation.\\nThere has been a variety of research on discourse parsing. But most of them suffer from the following\\nlimitations:\\n1. pipelined rather than end-to-end: they assume pre-segmented discourse, and worse yet, use\\ngold-standard segmentations\\n2. not self-contained: they rely on external syntactic parsers and pretrained word vectors;\\n3. complicated: they design sophisticated features, including those from parse-trees.\\nWe argue for the first time that discourse parsing should be viewed as an extension of, and be\\nperformed in conjunction with, constituency parsing. We propose the first joint syntacto-discourse\\ntree- bank, by unifying constituency and discourse tree representations. Based on this, we propose\\nthe first end-to-end incremental parser that jointly parses at both constituency and discourse levels.\\nOur algo- rithm builds up on the span-based parser; it employs the strong general- ization power\\nof bi-directional LSTMs, and parses efficiently and robustly with an extremely simple span-based\\nfeature set that does not use any tree structure information.\\nWe make the following contributions:\\n1. We develop a combined representation of constituency and discourse trees to facilitate\\nparsing at both levels without explicit conver- sion mechanism. Using this representation,\\nwe build and release a joint treebank based on the Penn Treebank and RST Treebank.\\n2. We propose a novel joint parser that parses at both constituency and discourse levels.\\n3. Even though it simultaneously performs con- stituency parsing, our parser does not use any\\nexplicit syntactic feature, nor does it need any binarization of discourse trees, thanks to the\\npowerful span-based framework.4. Empirically, our end-to-end parser outperforms the existing pipelined discourse pars- ing\\nefforts. When the gold EDUs are pro- vided, our parser is also competitive to other existing\\napproaches with sophisticated fea- tures.\\n2 Combined Representation & Treebank\\nWe first briefly review the discourse structures in Rhetorical Structure Theory, and then discuss how to\\nunify discourse and constituency trees, which gives rise to our syntacto-discourse treebank PTB-RST.\\n2.1 Review: RST Discourse Structures\\nIn an RST discourse tree, there are two types of branchings. Most of the internal tree nodes are binary\\nbranching, with one nucleus child containing the core semantic meaning of the current node, and\\none satellite child semantically decorating the nucleus. Like dependency labels, there is a relation\\nannotated between each satellite-nucleus pair, such as “Background” or “Purpose”. There are also\\nnon- binary-branching internal nodes whose children are conjunctions, e.g., a “List” of semantically\\nsimilar EDUs (which are all nucleus nodes).\\n2.2 Syntacto-Discourse Representation\\nIt is widely recognized that lower-level lexical and syntactic information can greatly help determin-\\ning both the boundaries of the EDUs (i.e., dis- course segmentation) as well as the semantic relations\\nbetween EDUs. While these previous approaches rely on pre-trained tools to provide both EDU\\nsegmentation and intra-EDU syntactic parse trees, we in- stead propose to directly determine the\\nlow-level segmentations, the syntactic parses, and the high- level discourse parses using a single joint\\nparser. This parser is trained on the combined trees of constituency and discourse structures.\\nWe first convert an RST tree to a format similar to those constituency trees in the Penn Treebank. For\\neach binary branching node with a nucleus child and a satellite child, we use the relation as the label\\nof the converted parent node. The nucleus/satellite relation, along with the direction (either ←or →,\\npointing from satellite to nucleus) is then used as the label. For a conjunctive branch (e.g. “List”), we\\nsimply use the relation as the label of the converted node.\\nAfter converting an RST tree into the constituency tree format, we then replace each leaf node (i.e.,\\nEDU) with the corresponding syntactic (sub)tree from PTB. Given that the sentences in the RST\\nTreebank is a subset of that of PTB, we can always find the corresponding constituency subtrees for\\neach EDU leaf node. In most cases, each EDU corresponds to one sin- gle (sub)tree in PTB, since the\\ndiscourse bound- aries generally do not conflict with constituencies. In other cases, one EDU node\\nmay correspond to multiple subtrees in PTB, and for these EDUs we use the lowest common ancestor\\nof those subtrees in the PTB as the label of that EDU in the con- verted tree. E.g., if C–D is one EDU\\nin the PTB tree A it might be converted to Purpose→DCB A based on the Penn Treebank and RST\\nTreebank. This PTB-RST treebank is released as a set of tools to generate the joint trees given Penn\\nTree- bank and RST Treebank data. During the align- ment between the RST trees and the PTB trees,\\nwe only keep the common parts of the two trees.\\nWe follow the standard training/testing split of the RST Treebank. In the training set, there are 347\\njoint trees with a total of 17,837 tokens, and the lengths of the discourses range from 30 to 2,199\\ntokens. In the test set, there are 38 joint trees with a total of 4,819 tokens, and the lengths vary from\\n45 to 2,607. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the discourse lengths over the whole dataset, which on\\naverage is about 2x of PTB sen- tence length, but longest ones are about 10x the longest lengths in\\nthe Treebank.\\n3 Joint Syntacto-Discourse Parsing\\nGiven the combined syntacto-discourse treebank, we now propose a joint parser that can perform\\nend-to-end discourse segmentation and parsing.\\n23.1 Extending Span-based Parsing\\nAs mentioned above, the input sequences are sub- stantially longer than PTB parsing, so we choose\\nlinear-time parsing, by adapting a popular greedy constituency parser, the span-based constituency\\nparser.\\n3.2 Joint PTB-RST Treebank\\nUsing the conversion strategy described above we build the first joint syntacto-discourse treebank.\\nAs in span-based parsing, at each step, we main- tain a a stack of spans. Notice that in conventional\\nincremental parsing, the stack stores the subtrees constructed so far, but in span-based constituency\\nparsing, the stack only stores the boundaries of subtrees, which are just a list of indices ...i k j. In\\nother words, quite shockingly, no tree structure is represented anywhere in the parser.\\nSimilar to span-based constituency parsing, we alternate between structural (either shift or combine)\\nand label (labelX or nolabel) actions in an odd-even fashion. But different from previous work, after a\\nstructural action, we choose to keep the last branching point k, i.e., i k j (mostly for combine, but also\\ntrivially for shift). This is because in our parsing mechanism, the dis- course relation between two\\nEDUs is actually de- termined after the previous combine action. We need to keep the splitting point\\nto clearly find the spans of the two EDUs to determine their relations. This midpoint k disappears\\nafter a label ac- tion; therefore we can use the shape of the last span on the stack (whether it contains\\nthe split point, i.e., i k j or i j) to determine the par- ity of the step and thus no longer need to carry the\\nstep z in the state .\\nThe nolabel action makes the binarization of the discourse/constituency tree unnecessary, because\\nnolabel actually combines the top two spans on the stack into one span, but without annotating the\\nnew span a label. This greatly simplifies the pre- processing and post-processing efforts needed.\\nPrec. Recall F1\\nConstituency 87.6 86.9 87.2\\nDiscourse 46.5 40.2 43.0\\nOverall 83.5 81.6 82.5\\nTable 1: Accuracies on PTB-RST at constituency and discourse levels.\\n3.3 Recurrent Neural Models and Training\\nThe scoring functions in the deductive system are calculated by an underlying neu- ral model, which\\nis similar to the bi-directional LSTM model that evaluates based on span boundary features. Again, it\\nis important to note that no discourse or syntactic tree structures are represented in the features.\\nDuring the decoding time, a document is first passed into a two-layer bi-directional LSTM model,\\nthen the outputs at each text position of the two layers of the bi-directional LSTMs are con- catenated\\nas the positional features. The spans at each parsing step can be represented as the fea- ture vectors\\nat the boundaries. The span features are then passed into fully connected networks with softmax to\\ncalculate the likelihood of performing the corresponding action or marking the cor- responding label.\\nWe use the “training with exploration” strategy and the dynamic oracle mechanism to make sure the\\nmodel can handle unseen parsing configurations properly.\\n4 Experiments\\nWe use the treebank described in Section 2 for empirical evaluation. We randomly choose 30\\ndocuments from the training set as the development set.\\nWe tune the hyperparameters of the neural model on the development set. For most of the hyperpa-\\nrameters we settle with the same values sug- gested previously. To alleviate the overfitting problem\\nfor training on the relative small RST Treebank, we use a dropout of 0.5.\\n3One particular hyperparameter is that we use a value to balance the chances between training\\nfollowing the exploration (i.e., the best action cho- sen by the neural model) and following the correct\\npath provided by the dynamic oracle. We find that = 0.8, i.e., following the dynamic oracle with a\\nprobability of 0.8, achieves the best performance. One explanation for this high chance to follow the\\noracle is that, since our combined trees are significantly larger than the constituency trees in Penn\\nTreebank, lower makes the parsing easily divert into wrong trails that are difficult to learn from.\\nSince our parser essentially performs both constituency parsing task and discourse parsing task. We\\nalso evaluate the performances on sentence constituency level and discourse level separately. The\\nresult is shown in Table 1.

       "  'file_content': 'Rapid Image Annotation Through Zero-Shot Learning\\nAbstract\\nRecent experiments on word analogies demonstrate that contemporary word vectors\\neffectively encapsulate subtle linguistic patterns through linear vector displace-\\nments. However, the extent to which these straightforward vector displacements\\ncan represent visual patterns across words remains uncertain. This research in-\\nvestigates a particular image-word relevance relationship. The findings indicate\\nthat, for a given image, word vectors of pertinent tags are positioned higher than\\nthose of unrelated tags along a primary axis within the word vector space. Drawing\\ninspiration from this insight, we suggest addressing image tagging by determining\\nthe main axis for an image. Specifically, we utilize linear mappings and intricate\\ndeep neural networks to deduce the primary axis from an input image. The re-\\nsultant tagging model exhibits remarkable adaptability. It operates swiftly on test\\nimages, with a processing time that remains constant regardless of the training set’s\\nsize. Furthermore, it showcases exceptional performance not only in conventional\\ntagging tasks using the NUS-WIDE dataset but also in comparison to competitive\\nbaselines when assigning tags to images that haven’t been seen during training.\\n1 Introduction\\nRecent advancements in representing words in vector spaces have proven advantageous for both\\nNatural Language Processing and various computer vision applications, including zero-shot learning\\nand image caption generation. The rationale behind using word vectors in NLP is rooted in the\\nobservation that detailed linguistic patterns among words are represented by linear offsets of word\\nvectors. This pivotal insight emerged from well-known word analogy studies. For example, syntactic\\nrelationships like \"dance\" to \"dancing\" parallel \"fly\" to \"flying,\" and semantic connections like \"king\"\\nto \"man\" mirror \"queen\" to \"woman.\" Nevertheless, it is yet to be determined whether the visual\\npatterns across words, implicitly employed in the aforementioned computer vision tasks, can similarly\\nbe represented by these basic vector offsets.\\nThis paper focuses on the task of image tagging, where an image necessitates the division of a word\\nlexicon into two distinct groups based on image-word relevance. For example, an image of a zoo might\\nhave relevant tags like \"people,\" \"animal,\" and \"zoo,\" while irrelevant tags might include \"sailor,\"\\n\"book,\" and \"landscape.\" This lexical division fundamentally differs from the nuanced syntactic or\\nsemantic relationships examined in word analogy tests. Instead, it concerns the connection between\\ntwo sets of words as prompted by a visual image. This type of word relationship is semantic and\\ndescriptive, emphasizing visual association, albeit at a broader level. Given this context, it is worth\\ninvestigating whether word vectors maintain the property where simple linear vector offsets can\\ndepict visual or image-based associative relationships between words. In the zoo example, while it’s\\neasy for humans to recognize that words like \"people,\" \"animal,\" and \"zoo\" are more related to the\\nzoo than words like \"sailor,\" \"book,\" and \"landscape,\" the question is whether such a zoo-association\\nrelationship can be represented by the nine pairwise vector offsets: \"people\" minus \"sailor,\" \"people\"\\nminus \"book,\" and so on, up to \"zoo\" minus \"landscape,\" between the vectors of relevant and irrelevant\\ntags.\\nA primary contribution of this research is an empirical investigation of these questions. Each image\\nestablishes a visual association rule over words, represented as a pair (Y , Y). Leveraging the extensive\\n.image collections in benchmark datasets designed for image tagging, we can explore numerous\\ndistinct visual association rules in words and the corresponding vector offsets in the word vector\\nspace. Our findings uncover a significant correlation: the offsets between the vectors of relevant tags\\n(Y) and those of irrelevant tags (Y) predominantly align in a consistent direction, which we term the\\n\"principal direction\". In other words, within the word vector space, there exists at least one vector\\n(direction), denoted as w, such that its inner products with the vector offsets between Y and Y are\\ngreater than 0. This can be expressed as:\\n(w,p ˘2014 n) > 0 equivalently, (w,p) > (w,n)\\nThis implies that the vector w ranks all relevant words Y ahead of irrelevant ones Y .\\nThe visual association patterns among words manifest as the linear rank-abilities of their correspond-\\ning word vectors. This observation corroborates findings from word analogy studies, suggesting that\\nmultiple relationships for a single word are embedded within a high-dimensional space. Furthermore,\\nthese relationships can be articulated using basic linear vector arithmetic.\\nBuilding on this discovery, we propose a solution to the image tagging challenge by identifying the\\nprimary axis along which relevant tags are ranked higher than irrelevant ones within the word vector\\nspace. We employ both linear mappings and deep neural networks to infer this primary axis from\\neach input image. This unique perspective on image tagging yields a highly adaptable tagging model.\\nThe model processes test images rapidly, maintaining a constant processing time irrespective of the\\ntraining dataset’s size. It not only delivers outstanding results in traditional tagging tasks but also\\nexcels at assigning new tags from a broad vocabulary that were not encountered during training. Our\\nmethod does not rely on prior knowledge of these new tags, as long as they exist within the same\\nvector space as the tags used during training. Consequently, we designate our technique as \"fast\\nzero-shot image tagging\" (Fast0Tag), acknowledging its strengths in both speed and its zero-shot\\nlearning capabilities.\\nIn stark contrast to our approach, prior methods for image tagging are limited to assigning only those\\ntags to test images that were seen during training, with a notable exception. These methods are\\nconstrained by the fixed and often limited number of tags present in the training data, which poses\\npractical challenges. For example, Flickr hosts approximately 53 million tags, and this number is\\nrapidly increasing. The work of Fu et al. represents a pioneering effort to extend an image tagging\\nmodel to previously unseen tags. However, when compared to our proposed method, it depends on\\ntwo extra assumptions. Firstly, it assumes that unseen tags are known beforehand to enable model\\nadjustment toward these tags. Secondly, it assumes that test images are known in advance for model\\nregularization. Moreover, this method is restricted to a very limited number, U, of unseen tags, as it\\nneeds to account for all 2U possibletagcombinations.\\nTo recap, our primary contribution lies in analyzing visual association patterns in words as they relate\\nto images and how these patterns are reflected in word vector offsets. We posit and confirm through\\nexperiments that a main direction exists in the word vector space for each visual association rule\\n(Y , Y), where vectors of relevant words are ranked higher than others. Building on this, our second\\ncontribution is an innovative image tagging model, Fast0Tag, which is both swift and capable of\\nhandling an open vocabulary of unseen tags. Lastly, we explore three distinct image tagging scenarios:\\ntraditional tagging, which assigns seen tags to images; zero-shot tagging, which annotates images\\nwith numerous unseen tags; and seen/unseen tagging, which uses both seen and unseen tags. Existing\\nresearch either addresses traditional tagging or zero-shot tagging with a limited number of unseen\\ntags. Our Fast0Tag method surpasses competitive baselines across all three scenarios.\\n2 Related Work\\nImage Tagging. The objective of image tagging is to allocate pertinent tags to an image or to generate\\na ranked list of tags. Within the academic community, this challenge has predominantly been tackled\\nfrom the standpoint of tag ranking. Generative approaches, which incorporate topic models and\\nmixture models, inherently rank candidate tags based on their conditional probabilities relative to the\\ntest image. Conversely, non-parametric, nearest-neighbor-based techniques frequently rank tags for\\na test image by aggregating votes from a selection of training images. Although nearest-neighbor\\nmethods generally exhibit superior performance compared to those reliant on generative models,\\nthey are plagued by substantial computational demands during both training and testing phases.\\n2The recently introduced FastTag algorithm offers a significant speed advantage while maintaining\\nperformance levels on par with nearest-neighbor methods. Our Fast0Tag method mirrors the reduced\\ncomplexity of FastTag. Embedding techniques, on the other hand, determine tag ranking scores via\\na cross-modal mapping between images and tags. This concept has been further developed using\\ndeep neural networks. Notably, aside from certain exceptions, the majority of these methods do not\\ntrain their models with an explicit ranking objective, despite ultimately ranking candidate tags for\\ntest images. This discrepancy between the trained models and their practical application contravenes\\nthe principle of Occam’s razor. We incorporate a ranking loss in our approach, similar to these\\nexceptions.\\nUnlike our Fast0Tag, which is capable of ranking both known and an unlimited number\\nof previously unseen tags for test images, the methods mentioned earlier are restricted\\nto assigning tags to images from a predetermined vocabulary encountered during train-\\ning. An exception to this is the work by Fu et al., where they address a predefined\\nnumber, U, of unseen tags by developing a multi-label model that considers all possible\\n2U combinationsofthesetags.However, thisapproachisconstrainedbythesmallnumberUofunseentagsitcanhandle.\\nWord Embedding. Diverging from the conventional one-hot vector representation of words, word\\nembedding maps each word to a continuous-valued vector, primarily learning from the statistical\\npatterns of word co-occurrences. While earlier studies on word embedding exist, our research\\nemphasizes the latest GloVe and word2vec vectors. As demonstrated in the well-known word analogy\\nexperiments, both types of word vectors effectively capture detailed semantic and syntactic patterns\\nthrough vector offsets. In this study, we further reveal that basic linear offsets can also represent the\\nbroader visual association patterns among words.\\nZero-Shot Learning. The term \"zero-shot learning\" is frequently used interchangeably with \"zero-shot\\nclassification,\" although the latter is actually a subset of the former. In contrast to weakly-supervised\\nlearning, which acquires new concepts by extracting information from noisy samples, zero-shot\\nclassification aims to classify objects from unseen classes by learning classifiers from seen classes.\\nAttributes and word vectors are two primary semantic sources that enable zero-shot classification.\\nOur Fast0Tag, together with Fu et al., expands the domain of zero-shot learning to include zero-\\nshot multi-label classification. Fu et al. approach this by converting the problem into zero-shot\\nclassification, where each combination of multiple labels is treated as a separate class. We, on the\\nother hand, model the labels directly, allowing us to assign or rank a large number of unseen tags for\\nan image.\\n3 The Linear Rank-Ability of Word Vectors\\nOur Fast0Tag method is enhanced by the discovery that the visual relationship between words,\\nspecifically how a lexicon is divided based on relevance to an image, manifests in the word vector\\nspace as a main direction. Along this direction, words or tags that are relevant to the image are ranked\\nhigher than those that are not. This section elaborates on this discovery.\\n3.1 The Regulation Over Words Due to Image Tagging\\nLet’s denote S as the set of seen tags available for training image tagging models, and U as the set\\nof tags unseen during the training phase. The training data is structured as (xm, Ym); m = 1, 2, ...,\\nM, where xm represents the feature vector of image m in RD, and Ym is a subset of S, containing\\nthe seen tags relevant to that image. For simplicity, we also use Ym to represent the collection of\\ncorresponding word or tag vectors.\\nTraditional image tagging seeks to assign seen tags from S to test images. Zero-shot tagging, as\\ndefined by Fu et al., aims to annotate test images using a predetermined set of unseen tags, U. Beyond\\nthese two scenarios, this paper introduces seen/unseen image tagging, which identifies both relevant\\nseen tags from S and relevant unseen tags from U for test images. Furthermore, the set of unseen\\ntags, U, can be open and continuously expanding.\\nWe define Ym as the complement of Ym in S, representing irrelevant seen tags. An image m\\nestablishes a visual association rule among words, essentially partitioning seen tags into two distinct\\nsets: Ym and Ym. Recognizing that various detailed syntactic and semantic patterns among words\\n3can be depicted through linear word vector offsets, we proceed to investigate the characteristics these\\nvector offsets might exhibit for this novel visual association rule.\\n3.2 Principal Direction and Cluster Structure\\nFigure 2 offers a visual representation of vector offsets (p - n), where p belongs to Ym and n belongs\\nto Ym, using both t-SNE and PCA for two different visual association rules over words. One rule is\\ndefined by an image associated with 5 relevant tags, and the other by an image with 15 relevant tags.\\nFrom these vector offsets, we identify two key structures:\\nPrincipal Direction: For a given visual association rule (Ym, Ym) in words for image m, the vector\\noffsets predominantly point in a similar direction, which we refer to as the principal direction. This\\nsuggests that along this principal direction, relevant tags Ym are ranked higher than irrelevant ones\\nYm.\\nCluster Structure: Within each visual association rule over words, there are discernible cluster\\nstructures in the vector offsets. Moreover, all offsets that point to the same relevant tag in Ym are\\ngrouped within the same cluster. In Figure 2, we distinguish offsets pointing to different relevant tags\\nby using different colors.\\nThe question remains whether these two observations can be generalized. Specifically, do they remain\\nvalid in the high-dimensional word vector space for a broader range of visual association rules defined\\nby other images? To address this, we designed an experiment to confirm the existence of principal\\ndirections in word vector spaces, or equivalently, the linear rank-ability of word vectors. We defer the\\ninvestigation of the cluster structure to future research.\\n3.3 Testing the Linear Rank-Ability Hypothesis\\nThe experiments in this section are performed using the validation set of the NUS-WIDE dataset,\\nwhich includes 26,844 images, 925 seen tags (S), and 81 unseen tags (U). The number of relevant\\nseen/unseen tags associated with an image varies from 1 to 20/117, with an average of 1.7/4.9. Further\\ndetails can be found in Section 5.\\nOur goal is to explore whether a primary direction exists for any visual association rule (Ym, Ym)\\ncreated by image m, along which relevant tags Ym rank higher than irrelevant tags Ym. This can be\\nconfirmed if we find a vector w in the word vector space that fulfills the ranking conditions (w, p) >\\n(w, n) for all p in Ym and n in Ym.\\nTo achieve this, we train a linear ranking SVM for each visual association rule using all corresponding\\npairs (p, n). We then rank word vectors using the SVM and assess the number of violated constraints.\\nSpecifically, we use MiAP, with higher values being preferable, to compare the SVM’s ranking list\\nagainst the ranking constraints. This process is repeated for all validation images, resulting in 21,863\\nunique visual association rules.\\nRanking SVM Implementation. We utilize the primal formulation of ranking SVM for our experi-\\nments, which is defined as:\\nmin 1/2 ||w||2 + max(0, 1 − (w, yi) + (w, yj))foryiY m, yjY m\\nHere, is a hyperparameter that balances the objective and regularization.\\nResults. The average MiAP outcomes across all distinct regulations are presented in Figure 3(left).\\nWe evaluate 300D GloVe vectors and word2vec vectors of dimensions 100, 300, 500, and 1000. The\\nhorizontal axis represents various regularizations used for training the ranking SVMs, with higher\\nvalues indicating stronger regularization. In the 300D GloVe space and word2vec spaces of 300, 500,\\nand 1000 dimensions, more than two ranking SVMs, with low values, produce nearly ideal ranking\\nresults (MiAP 1). This demonstrates that seen tags S are linearly rankable under almost every visual\\nassociation rule, satisfying all ranking constraints set by relevant Ym and irrelevant Ym tags for\\nimage m.\\nHowever, caution is advised before extending conclusions beyond the experimental vocabulary S\\nof seen tags. While an image m imposes a visual association rule over all words, this rule leads\\nto different partitions of distinct experimental vocabularies (e.g., seen tags S and unseen tags U).\\n4Therefore, we anticipate that the principal direction for seen tags should also apply to unseen tags\\nunder the same rule, if the questions at the end of Section 3.2 are answered affirmatively.\\nGeneralization to Unseen Tags. We investigate whether the same principal direction applies to both\\nseen and unseen tags under each visual association rule induced by an image. This is partially\\nvalidated by applying the previously trained ranking SVMs to unseen tag vectors, as the \"true\"\\nprincipal directions are unknown. We use the 81 unseen tags U as \"test data\" for the trained ranking\\nSVMs, each resulting from an image-induced visual association. NUS-WIDE provides annotations\\nfor these 81 tags. The results, shown in Figure 3(right), significantly outperform the basic baseline of\\nrandom tag ranking, indicating that the directions produced by SVMs are generalizable to the new\\nvocabulary U of words.\\nObservation. We conclude that word vectors are an effective medium for transferring knowl-\\nedge—specifically, rank-ability along the principal direction—from seen to unseen tags. We have\\nempirically confirmed that the visual association rule (Ym, Ym) in words due to an image m can be\\nrepresented by the linear rank-ability of corresponding word vectors along a principal direction. Our\\nexperiments involve a total of |S| + |U| = 1,006 words. Future work should include larger-scale and\\ntheoretical studies.\\n4 Approximating the Linear Ranking Functions\\nThis section introduces our Fast0Tag approach for image tagging. Initially, we explain how to address\\nimage tagging by approximating the principal directions, based on their existence and generalization,\\nas confirmed in the previous section. Subsequently, we describe the detailed approximation methods\\nused.\\n4.1 Image Tagging by Ranking\\nBased on the findings from Section 3, which indicate the existence of a principal direction, wm, in the\\nword vector space for each visual association rule (Ym, Ym) generated by an image m, we propose a\\ndirect solution for image tagging. The core idea is to approximate this principal direction by learning\\na mapping function, f(˘00b7), that connects the visual space to the word vector space, such that:\\nf(xm) wm\\nHere, xm is the visual feature representation of image m. Consequently, given a test image x, we\\ncan promptly suggest a list of tags by ranking the word vectors of the tags along the direction f(x),\\nspecifically by the ranking scores:\\nt S U, (f(x), t)\\nThis applies whether the tags are from the seen set S or the unseen set U.\\nWe investigate both linear and nonlinear neural networks to implement the approximation function\\nf(x) w.\\n4.2 Approximation by Linear Regression\\nIn this approach, we assume a linear function from the input image representation x to the output\\nprincipal direction w, defined as:\\nf(x) := Ax\\nHere, A can be determined in a closed form through linear regression. Thus, from the training data,\\nwe have:\\nwm = Axm+m, form= 1, 2, ..., M\\nwhere wmistheprincipaldirectionforalloffsetvectorsoftheseentags, correspondingtothevisualassociationrule (Ym, Ym)forimagem, andmrepresentstheerrors.Minimizingthemeansquarederrorsprovidesuswithaclosed −\\nformsolutionforA.\\nHowever, a challenge arises as we do not know the exact principal directions\\nwm.Thetrainingdataonlyprovideimagesx mandrelevanttagsYm.Weoptforastraightforwardalternative, usingthedirectionsderived fromrankingSV MsinSection3inequation(5).Hence, theprocessinvolvestwostagestolearnthelinearfunctionf(x) =\\nAx.ThefirststagetrainsarankingSV Moverthewordvectorsofseentagsforeachvisualassociation (Ym, Ym).ThesecondstagecomputesthemappingmatrixAvialinearregression, usingthedirectionsfromtherankingSV Msastargets.\\n5Discussion. The use of linear transformation between visual and word vector spaces has been\\npreviously explored, for instance, in zero-shot classification and image annotation/classification. This\\nwork distinguishes itself by the clear interpretation of the mapped image f(x) = Ax as the principal\\ndirection for tag assignment, which has been empirically validated. We further extend this to a\\nnonlinear transformation using a neural network.\\n4.3 Approximation by Neural Networks\\nWe also explore a nonlinear mapping f(x; ) using a multi-layer neural network, where represents the\\nnetwork parameters. The network architecture, illustrated in Figure 4, includes two RELU layers\\nfollowed by a linear layer that outputs the approximated principal direction, w, for an input image\\nx. We anticipate that the nonlinear mapping function f(x; ) will provide greater modeling flexibility\\ncompared to the linear approach.\\nTraining the neural network by regressing to the M directions obtained from ranking SVMs is not\\nideal, as confirmed by both intuition and experiments. The number of training instances, M, is small\\nrelative to the network’s parameter count, increasing the risk of overfitting. Moreover, the directions\\nfrom ranking SVMs are not the true principal directions, making it unnecessary to rely on them.\\nInstead, we integrate the two stages from Section 4.2. We aim for the neural network’s output f(xm; )\\nto represent the principal direction, where all relevant tag vectors p Ym rank higher than irrelevant\\nones n Ym for an image m. Let’s define:\\nv(p, n; ) = (f(xm; ), n) - (f(xm; ), p)\\nas the degree of violation of these ranking constraints.\\nWe then minimize the following loss function to train the neural network:\\n* = argmin w m ∗ l(xm, Ym; )l(xm, Ym; ) =log(1 +expv(p, n; ))forpYm, nYm\\nwhere wm = 1/(|Ym|∗|Ym|)normalizestheper−imageRankNetlossbythenumberofrankingconstraintsimposedbyimagemoverthetags.Thissetupallowsthefunctionf (x)todirectlyconsidertherankingconstraintsfromrelevantandirrelevanttags, anditcanbeoptimizedeffectivelyusingstandardmini −\\nbatchgradientdescent.\\nPractical Considerations.

Hinge loss performed the worst, likely because it’s\\nnot designed for ranking. Crammer-Singer, pairwise max-out, and RankNet yielded comparable\\nresults, with RankNet slightly outperforming the others by about 2% in MiAP, possibly due to easier\\noptimization control. Listwise ranking loss could also be considered.\\n5 Experiments on NUS-WIDE\\nThis section details our experimental results, comparing our method against several strong baselines\\nfor traditional image tagging on the large-scale NUS-WIDE dataset. Additionally, we evaluate our\\nmethod on zero-shot and seen/unseen image tagging scenarios, extending some existing zero-shot\\nclassification algorithms and exploring variations of our approach for comparison.\\n5.1 Dataset and Configuration\\nNUS-WIDE Dataset. We primarily utilize the NUS-WIDE dataset for our experiments. This dataset\\nis a standard benchmark for image tagging, originally containing 269,648 images. We were able\\nto retrieve 223,821 images, as some were either corrupted or removed from Flickr. Following\\nthe recommended protocol, we divide the dataset into a training set of 134,281 images and a test\\nset of 89,603 images. We further allocate 20% of the training set as a validation set for tuning\\nhyperparameters in both our method and the baselines, and for conducting the empirical analyses in\\nSection 3.\\n6Annotations of NUS-WIDE. NUS-WIDE provides three sets of tags for its images. The first set\\nincludes 81 \"ground truth\" tags, carefully selected to represent Flickr tags, encompassing both general\\nterms (e.g., \"animal\") and specific ones (e.g., \"dog,\" \"flower\"), and corresponding to frequent Flickr\\ntags. These tags are annotated by students and are less noisy than those directly collected from the\\nWeb, serving as the ground truth for evaluating image tagging methods. The second and third sets\\ncontain 1,000 popular and nearly 5,000 raw Flickr tags, respectively.\\nImage Features and Word Vectors. We extract and normalize image feature representations using\\nVGG-19. Both GloVe and Word2vec word vectors are used in our empirical analysis in Section 3,\\nwith 300D GloVe vectors used for the remaining experiments. Word vectors are also normalized.\\nEvaluation. We assess tagging results using two types of metrics: mean image average precision\\n(MiAP), which considers the entire ranking list, and precision, recall, and F1-score for the top K tags\\nin the list (K = 3 and K = 5). Both metrics are commonly used in image tagging research. For details\\non calculating MiAP and top-K precision and recall, we refer readers to Section 3.3 of Li et al. (2015)\\nand Section 4.2 of Gong et al. (2013), respectively.\\n5.2 Conventional Image Tagging\\nIn this section, we present experimental results for traditional image tagging, using the 81 \"ground\\ntruth\" annotated concepts in NUS-WIDE to benchmark various methods.\\nBaselines. We include TagProp as a primary competitive baseline, representing nearest-neighbor-\\nbased methods that generally outperform parametric methods built from generative models and have\\nshown state-of-the-art results in experimental studies. We also compare against two recent parametric\\nmethods, WARP and FastTag, both based on deep architectures but using different models. For a\\nfair comparison, we use the same VGG-19 features across all methods, with code for TagProp and\\nFastTag provided by the authors and W ARP implemented based on our neural network architecture.\\nAdditionally, we compare to WSABIE and CCA, which correlate images and relevant tags in a\\nlow-dimensional space. Hyperparameters for all methods are selected using the validation set.\\nResults. Table 4 presents the comparison results among TagProp, W ARP, FastTag, WSABIE, CCA,\\nand our Fast0Tag models, implemented with both linear mapping and a nonlinear neural network.\\nTagProp significantly outperforms W ARP and FastTag, but its training and testing complexities are\\nhigh, at O(M2) and O(M) respectively, relative to the training set size M. In contrast, WARP and\\nFastTag are more efficient, with O(M) training complexity and constant testing complexity due to\\ntheir parametric nature. Our Fast0Tag with linear mapping yields results comparable to TagProp,\\nwhile Fast0Tag with the neural network surpasses the other methods. Both implementations maintain\\nlow computational complexities similar to W ARP and FastTag.\\nTable 1: Comparison results of the conventional image tagging with 81 tags on NUS-WIDE.\\nMethod MiAP K = 3 K = 5\\nP R F1 P R F1\\nCCA 19 9 15 11 7 20 11\\nWSABIE 28 16 27 20 12 35 18\\nTagProp 53 29 50 37 22 62 32\\nW ARP 48 27 45 34 20 57 30\\nFastTag 41 23 39 29 19 54 28\\nFast0Tag (lin.) 52 29 50 37 21 60 31\\nFast0Tag (net.) 55 31 52 39 23 65 34\\n5.3 Zero-Shot and Seen/Unseen Image Tagging\\nThis section presents results for two novel image tagging scenarios: zero-shot and seen/unseen\\ntagging.\\nFu et al. formalised the zero-shot image tagging problem, which aims to annotate test images using a\\npre-defined set U of unseen tags. Our Fast0Tag naturally applies to this scenario by simply ranking\\nthe unseen tags with equation (3). Furthermore, this paper also considers seen/unseen image tagging,\\n7which finds both relevant seen tags from S and relevant unseen tags from U for the test images. The\\nset of unseen tags U could be open and dynamically growing.\\nIn our experiments, we treat the 81 concepts with high-quality user annotations in NUS-WIDE as\\nthe unseen set U for evaluation and comparison. We use the remaining 925 out of the 1000 frequent\\nFlickr tags to form the seen set S - 75 tags are shared by the original 81 and 1,000 tags.\\nBaselines. Our Fast0Tag models can be readily applied to the zero-shot and seen/unseen image\\ntagging scenarios. For comparison, we study the following baselines.\\nSeen2Unseen. We first propose a simple method that extends an arbitrary traditional image tagging\\nmethod to also work with previously unseen tags. It originates from our analysis experiment in\\nSection 3. First, we use any existing method to rank the seen tags for a test image. Second, we train a\\nranking SVM in the word vector space using the ranking list of the seen tags. Third, we rank unseen\\n(and seen) tags using the learned SVM for zero-shot (and seen/unseen) tagging.\\nLabelEM. The label embedding method achieves impressive results on zero-shot classification for\\nfine-grained object recognition. If we consider each tag of S U as a unique class, though this implies\\nthat some classes will have duplicated images, the LabelEM can be directly applied to the two new\\ntagging scenarios. LabelEM+. We also modify the objective loss function of LabelEM when we train\\nthe model, by carefully removing the terms that involve duplicated images. This slightly improves\\nthe performance of LabelEM. ConSE. Again by considering each tag as a class, we include a recent\\nzero-shot classification method, ConSE in the following experiments. Note that it is computationally\\ninfeasible to compare with Fu et al., which might be the first work to our knowledge on expanding\\nimage tagging to handle unseen tags, because it considers all the possible combinations of the unseen\\ntags. Results. Table 5 summarizes the results of the baselines and Fast0Tag when they are applied to\\nthe zero-shot and seen/unseen image tagging tasks. Overall, Fast0Tag, with either linear or neural\\nnetwork mapping, performs the best.\\nAdditionally, in the table, we add two special rows whose results are mainly for reference. The\\nRandom row corresponds to the case when we return a random list of tags in U for zero-shot tagging\\n(and in U S for seen/unseen tagging) to each test image. We compare this row with the row of\\nSeen2Unseen, in which we extend TagProp to handle the unseen tags. We can see that the results of\\nSeen2Unseen are significantly better than randomly ranking the tags. This tells us that the simple\\nSeen2Unseen is effective in expanding the labeling space of traditional image tagging methods. Some\\ntag completion methods may also be employed for the same purpose as Seen2Unseen. Another\\nspecial row in Table 5 is the last one with RankSVM for zero-shot image tagging. We obtain its\\nresults through the following steps. Given a test image, we assume the annotation of the seen tags,\\nS, are known and then learn a ranking SVM with the default regularization = 1. The learned SVM\\nis then used to rank the unseen tags for this image. One may wonder that the results of this row\\nshould thus be the upper bound of our Fast0Tag implemented based on linear regression because the\\nranking SVM models are the targets of the linear regression. However, the results show that they are\\nnot. This is not surprising, but rather it reinforces our previous statement that the learned ranking\\nSVMs are not the \"true\" principal directions. The Fast0Tag implemented by the neural network is an\\neffective alternative for seeking the principal directions. It would also be interesting to compare the\\nresults in Table 5 (zero-shot image tagging) with those in Table 4 (conventional tagging), because the\\nexperiments for the two tables share the same testing images and the same candidate tags; they only\\ndiffer in which tags are used for training. We can see that the Fast0Tag (net.) results of the zero-shot\\ntagging in Table 5 are actually comparable to the conventional tagging results in Table 4, particularly\\nabout the same as FastTag’s. These results are encouraging, indicating that it is unnecessary to use\\nall the candidate tags for training in order to have high-quality tagging performance. Annotating\\nimages with 4,093 unseen tags. What happens when we have a large number of unseen tags showing\\nup at the test stage? NUS-WIDE provides noisy annotations for the images with over 5,000 Flickr\\ntags. Excluding the 925 seen tags that are used to train models, there are 4,093 remaining unseen\\ntags. We use the Fast0Tag models to rank all the unseen tags for the test images, and the results\\nare shown in Table 3. Noting that the noisy annotations weaken the credibility of the evaluation\\nprocess, the results are reasonably low but significantly higher than the random lists. Qualitative\\nresults. Figure 6 shows the top five tags for some exemplar images, returned by Fast0Tag under\\nthe conventional, zero-shot, and seen/unseen image tagging scenarios. Those by TagProp under the\\nconventional tagging are shown on the rightmost. The tags in green color appear in the ground truth\\n8annotation; those in red color and italic font are the mistaken tags. Interestingly, Fast0Tag performs\\nequally well for traditional and zero-shot tagging and makes even the same mistakes.\\n6 Experiments on IAPRTC-12\\nWe present another set of experiments conducted on the widely used IAPRTC-12 dataset. We use\\nthe same tag annotation and image training-test split as described in prior work for our experiments.\\nThere are 291 unique tags and 19,627 images in IAPRTC-12. The dataset is split into 17,341 training\\nimages and 2,286 testing images. We further separate 15\\n6.1 Configuration\\nSimilar to the experiments in the previous section, we evaluate our methods in three distinct tasks:\\nconventional tagging, zero-shot tagging, and seen/unseen tagging. Unlike NUS-WIDE, where a\\nrelatively small set of 81 tags is considered the ground truth annotation, all 291 tags of IAPRTC-12\\nare typically used in prior work to compare different methods. Therefore, we also use all of them\\nfor conventional tagging. For the zero-shot and seen/unseen tagging tasks, we exclude 20The visual\\nfeatures, evaluation metrics, word vectors, and baseline methods remain the same as described in the\\nmain text.\\n6.2 Results\\nTables 4 and 5 display the results for all three image tagging scenarios (conventional, zero-shot, and\\nseen/unseen tagging). The proposed Fast0Tag continues to outperform the other competitive baselines\\non this new IAPRTC-12 dataset. A notable observation, which is less apparent on NUS-WIDE\\nprobably due to its noisier seen tags, is the significant performance gap between LabelEM+ and\\nLabelEM. This indicates that traditional zero-shot classification methods may not be directly suitable\\nfor either zero-shot or seen/unseen image tagging tasks. However, performance can be improved\\nby tweaking LabelEM and carefully removing terms in its formulation that involve comparisons of\\nidentical images.\\n7 More Qualitative Results\\nIn this section, we provide additional qualitative results from different tagging methods on both the\\nNUS-WIDE and IAPRTC-12 datasets. These are presented to supplement the findings discussed in\\nthe main text. Due to the incompleteness and noise in tag ground truth, many accurate tag predictions\\nare often incorrectly assessed as mistakes because they don’t match the ground truth. This issue is\\nparticularly evident in the 4k zero-shot tagging results, where a wide variety of tag candidates are\\nconsidered.\\n8 Conclusion\\nWe have conducted a thorough examination of a specific visual pattern in words: the visual association\\nrule that divides words into two distinct groups based on their relevance to an image. We also\\ninvestigated how this rule is captured by vector offsets within the word vector space. Our empirical\\nfindings demonstrate that for any given image, there exists a main direction in the word vector\\nspace along which vectors of relevant tags are ranked higher than those of irrelevant tags. While\\nour experimental analyses involved 1,006 words, future research should encompass larger-scale\\nand theoretical investigations. Based on this discovery, we developed a Fast0Tag model to address\\nimage tagging by estimating the primary directions for input images. Our method is as efficient as\\nFastTag and is capable of annotating images with a large number of previously unseen tags. Extensive\\nexperiments confirm the effectiveness of our Fast0Tag approach.\\n9'},\n",

The investigation unfolds as a complex narrative, weaving\\ntogether threads from various disciplines, including computer science, urban plan-\\nning, environmental science, and sociology, to create a rich tapestry of knowledge\\nand insight into the intricacies of sustainable urban transportation with autonomous\\nvehicles. As the research progresses, it becomes increasingly evident that the\\nrelationship between autonomous vehicles and sustainable urban transportation\\nis far more intricate than initially anticipated, involving a delicate interplay of\\ntechnological, social, and environmental factors, which must be carefully balanced\\nto achieve the desired outcomes. The study’s findings and conclusions serve as\\na foundation for future research, highlighting the need for continued exploration\\nand innovation in the realm of sustainable urban transportation with autonomous\\nvehicles.\\n1 Introduction\\nSustainable urban transportation is a pivotal aspect of modern city planning, as the world grapples with\\nthe challenges of climate change, air pollution, and traffic congestion. The integration of autonomous\\nvehicles into urban transportation systems has the potential to revolutionize the way people move\\naround cities, offering a cleaner, safer, and more efficient alternative to traditional fossil fuel-basedtransportation methods. However, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle\\ntechnology raises a myriad of complex questions and challenges, from the technical and infrastructural\\nrequirements of supporting autonomous vehicles, to the social and economic implications of their\\nwidespread adoption.\\nOne of the most significant advantages of autonomous vehicles is their potential to reduce greenhouse\\ngas emissions and mitigate the environmental impacts of urban transportation. By optimizing routes\\nand reducing fuel consumption, autonomous vehicles could significantly decrease the carbon footprint\\nof urban transportation systems, contributing to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly\\nurban environment. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles could also improve road safety, as they are\\ncapable of detecting and responding to potential hazards more quickly and accurately than human\\ndrivers, thereby reducing the risk of accidents and injuries.\\nDespite these potential benefits, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technol-\\nogy is not without its challenges. For instance, the requirement for advanced infrastructure, including\\nhigh-resolution mapping and real-time data transmission systems, poses significant technical and\\nfinancial hurdles. Additionally, the need for standardized regulations and laws governing the use\\nof autonomous vehicles raises complex questions about liability, insurance, and public acceptance.\\nMoreover, the potential for job displacement, as autonomous vehicles replace human drivers, raises\\nimportant social and economic concerns that must be carefully considered and addressed.\\nIn a bizarre twist, some researchers have suggested that the most effective way to implement\\nautonomous vehicle technology may be to abandon traditional notions of transportation infrastructure\\naltogether, and instead focus on creating \"virtual transportation networks\" that exist solely in the\\ndigital realm. According to this unconventional approach, autonomous vehicles would be capable\\nof navigating and interacting with virtual environments, rather than physical ones, allowing for the\\ncreation of entirely new forms of transportation that are not bound by traditional notions of space\\nand distance. While this idea may seem far-fetched, it highlights the need for creative and innovative\\nthinking in the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology.\\nMoreover, the integration of autonomous vehicles into urban transportation systems also raises\\nimportant questions about the role of human agency and decision-making in the transportation\\nprocess. As autonomous vehicles become increasingly capable of navigating and interacting with\\ntheir environments, the need for human intervention and oversight may decrease, potentially leading\\nto a loss of control and autonomy for individual citizens. This raises important concerns about the\\nimpact of autonomous vehicle technology on urban planning and design, as well as the potential for\\nautonomous vehicles to exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.\\nIn addition to these challenges, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technol-\\nogy also raises important concerns about the potential for unexpected consequences and unforeseen\\nevents. For instance, the possibility of autonomous vehicles being hacked or compromised by mali-\\ncious actors raises significant concerns about public safety and security. Furthermore, the potential\\nfor autonomous vehicles to interact with and adapt to their environments in unpredictable ways raises\\nimportant questions about the need for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of autonomous vehicle\\nsystems.\\nThe potential for autonomous vehicles to transform urban transportation systems is vast and multi-\\nfaceted, with implications that extend far beyond the technical and infrastructural requirements of\\nsupporting autonomous vehicles. As researchers and policymakers, it is essential that we consider the\\nfull range of potential benefits and challenges associated with autonomous vehicle technology, from\\nthe environmental and social impacts of their widespread adoption, to the potential for unexpected\\nconsequences and unforeseen events. By taking a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach\\nto the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology, we can ensure that the\\nbenefits of autonomous vehicles are realized, while minimizing the risks and challenges associated\\nwith their adoption.\\nFurthermore, the study of autonomous vehicle technology also intersects with other fields, such as\\nartificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, which are essential for the development\\nof sophisticated autonomous vehicle systems. The use of machine learning algorithms, for example,\\nenables autonomous vehicles to learn from experience and adapt to new situations, while data\\nanalytics provides valuable insights into transportation patterns and trends. The integration of these\\n2technologies has the potential to create highly efficient and optimized transportation systems, which\\ncould revolutionize the way people move around cities.\\nThe relationship between autonomous vehicle technology and urban planning is also complex and\\nmultifaceted. As autonomous vehicles become increasingly prevalent, urban planners will need to\\nrethink traditional notions of transportation infrastructure, including roads, highways, and public\\ntransportation systems. The creation of dedicated lanes for autonomous vehicles, for example,\\ncould improve safety and efficiency, while also reducing congestion and pollution. Additionally, the\\nintegration of autonomous vehicles into public transportation systems could provide new opportunities\\nfor mobility and accessibility, particularly for elderly and disabled individuals.\\nIn conclusion, the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology has the\\npotential to transform urban transportation systems, offering a cleaner, safer, and more efficient\\nalternative to traditional fossil fuel-based transportation methods. However, the challenges and\\ncomplexities associated with autonomous vehicle technology are significant, and will require careful\\nconsideration and planning to overcome. By taking a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach\\nto the development and implementation of autonomous vehicle technology, we can ensure that the\\nbenefits of autonomous vehicles are realized, while minimizing the risks and challenges associated\\nwith their adoption. The future of urban transportation is likely to be shaped by the intersection\\nof technological, social, and economic factors, and it is essential that we consider the full range of\\npotential implications and consequences of autonomous vehicle technology.\\n2 Related Work\\nSustainable urban transportation has been a topic of interest for many years, with various approaches\\nbeing explored to reduce the environmental impact of transportation systems. One approach that has\\ngained significant attention in recent years is the use of autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles\\nhave the potential to revolutionize the way people move around cities, reducing the need for personal\\nvehicle ownership and promoting a more shared and sustainable transportation system. However,\\nthe integration of autonomous vehicles into existing transportation systems is a complex task that\\nrequires careful consideration of various factors, including infrastructure, regulations, and public\\nacceptance.\\nThe concept of autonomous vehicles is not new, and researchers have been exploring the idea of\\nself-driving cars for decades. One of the earliest examples of an autonomous vehicle was the Stanford\\nCart, a remote-controlled vehicle that was developed in the 1960s. Since then, there have been\\nnumerous advancements in the field, with the development of more sophisticated sensors, algorithms,\\nand computing power. Today, autonomous vehicles are being tested on public roads, and several\\ncompanies are already offering autonomous taxi services in select cities.\\nDespite the progress that has been made, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed\\nbefore autonomous vehicles can become a reality. One of the main challenges is the development of\\nrobust and reliable sensor systems that can detect and respond to various scenarios on the road. This\\nincludes the detection of pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles, as well as the ability to navigate\\nthrough complex intersections and construction zones. Another challenge is the development of\\nalgorithms that can make decisions in real-time, taking into account factors such as traffic laws, road\\nconditions, and weather.\\nIn addition to the technical challenges, there are also social and economic factors that need to be\\nconsidered. For example, the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles could lead to significant\\njob losses in the transportation sector, as human drivers become obsolete. On the other hand,\\nautonomous vehicles could also create new job opportunities in fields such as software development,\\nengineering, and maintenance. Furthermore, the use of autonomous vehicles could also have a\\nsignificant impact on urban planning, as cities may need to be redesigned to accommodate the new\\ntechnology.\\nOne unexpected approach to sustainable urban transportation is the concept of \"vehicular algae\\nfarms,\" where autonomous vehicles are equipped with algae-filled tanks that can be used to produce\\nbiofuels. This approach is based on the idea that algae can be used to absorb carbon dioxide from the\\natmosphere, producing oxygen and organic compounds that can be converted into biofuels. While\\n3this approach may seem bizarre, it has been proposed as a potential solution to reduce the carbon\\nfootprint of transportation systems.\\nAnother unusual approach is the use of \"swarm intelligence\" to optimize traffic flow. This involves\\nusing autonomous vehicles to create a network of interconnected vehicles that can communicate with\\neach other and adjust their behavior to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. The idea is\\nthat by mimicking the behavior of swarms of insects, such as bees or ants, autonomous vehicles can\\ncreate a more efficient and sustainable transportation system.\\nThe use of autonomous vehicles in public transportation systems is also being explored. For example,\\nautonomous buses are being tested in several cities, with the goal of reducing labor costs and\\nimproving the efficiency of public transportation. However, there are also concerns about the safety\\nand reliability of autonomous buses, particularly in areas with high levels of pedestrian activity.\\nIn addition to the technical and social challenges, there are also regulatory hurdles that need to\\nbe addressed. For example, there is currently a lack of standardization in the development and\\ndeployment of autonomous vehicles, which can make it difficult to ensure safety and consistency\\nacross different manufacturers and jurisdictions. Furthermore, there are also concerns about liability\\nand accountability in the event of an accident involving an autonomous vehicle.\\nThe use of autonomous vehicles in freight transportation is also being explored. For example,\\nautonomous trucks are being tested on highways, with the goal of reducing labor costs and improving\\nthe efficiency of freight transportation. However, there are also concerns about the safety and\\nreliability of autonomous trucks, particularly in areas with high levels of traffic congestion.\\nThe integration of autonomous vehicles into existing transportation systems will require significant\\ninvestments in infrastructure, including the development of dedicated lanes and communication sys-\\ntems. For example, the use of dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) technology can enable\\nautonomous vehicles to communicate with each other and with infrastructure, such as traffic lights\\nand road signs. However, the deployment of DSRC technology will require significant investments in\\ninfrastructure, including the installation of DSRC transceivers along roads and highways.\\nThe use of autonomous vehicles in rural areas is also being explored. For example, autonomous\\nvehicles are being tested in rural areas, with the goal of improving access to transportation and\\nreducing the isolation of rural communities. However, there are also concerns about the safety and\\nreliability of autonomous vehicles in rural areas, particularly in areas with limited infrastructure and\\nhigh levels of wildlife activity.\\nThe development of autonomous vehicles is a complex task that requires careful consideration of\\nvarious factors, including technical, social, and economic factors. While there are many challenges\\nthat need to be addressed, the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are significant, including\\nimproved safety, reduced congestion, and increased accessibility. As researchers and policymakers\\ncontinue to explore the use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation, it is essential\\nto consider the many factors that will influence the adoption and deployment of this technology.\\nThe concept of \"mobility-as-a-service\" is also being explored, where autonomous vehicles are used\\nto provide on-demand transportation services to users. This approach has the potential to reduce the\\nneed for personal vehicle ownership and promote a more shared and sustainable transportation system.\\nHowever, there are also concerns about the impact of mobility-as-a-service on public transportation\\nsystems, particularly in areas with high levels of congestion.\\nThe use of autonomous vehicles in emergency response situations is also being explored. For example,\\nautonomous vehicles are being tested as a potential solution for emergency medical response, where\\nthey can be used to transport patients to hospitals quickly and safely. However, there are also concerns\\nabout the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles in emergency response situations, particularly\\nin areas with high levels of traffic congestion.\\nThe development of autonomous vehicles is a rapidly evolving field, with new technologies and\\ninnovations being developed every day. As researchers and policymakers continue to explore the\\nuse of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation, it is essential to consider the many\\nfactors that will influence the adoption and deployment of this technology. This includes technical,\\nsocial, and economic factors, as well as regulatory and infrastructure considerations. By taking a\\ncomprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to the development of autonomous vehicles, we can\\ncreate a more sustainable and efficient transportation system that benefits everyone.\\n4In conclusion, the use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation is a complex\\nand multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration of various factors.

The use of autonomous vehicles in smart cities\\ncan help to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality of life for urban\\nresidents. However, the development of smart cities also requires careful consideration of various\\nfactors, including infrastructure, governance, and public engagement.\\nThe use of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation can also be seen as a key\\ncomponent of the broader concept of \"shared mobility,\" where transportation services are shared\\namong multiple users. The use of autonomous vehicles in shared mobility systems can help to reduce\\nthe need for personal vehicle ownership, promote a more sustainable transportation system, and\\nenhance the overall quality of life for urban residents. However, the development of shared mobility\\nsystems also requires careful consideration of various factors, including business models, governance,\\nand public engagement.\\nIn addition, the application of autonomous vehicles in sustainable urban transportation can also be\\nseen as a key component of the broader concept of \"urban logistics,\" where the movement of goods\\nand people is optimized to reduce congestion, improve air quality, and enhance the overall quality\\nof life for urban residents. The use of autonomous vehicles in urban logistics can help to reduce\\nthe need for human drivers, promote a more efficient transportation system, and enhance the overall\\nquality of life for urban residents.

The application of autonomous vehicles in transportation systems\\nmanagement can help to reduce the need for human drivers, promote a more efficient transportation\\nsystem, and enhance the overall quality of life for urban residents. However, the development of\\ntransportation systems management also requires careful consideration of various factors, including\\ninfrastructure, governance, and public engagement.\\nIn the context of\\n3 Methodology\\nTo develop a comprehensive framework for sustainable urban transportation with autonomous vehi-\\ncles, we employed a multi-faceted approach that integrated theoretical modeling, simulation-based\\nanalysis, and empirical data collection. The methodology was divided into distinct phases, each de-\\nsigned to investigate a specific aspect of the problem. Initially, we conducted an exhaustive review of\\nexisting literature on urban transportation systems, autonomous vehicle technology, and sustainability\\nmetrics. This review helped identify key factors influencing the efficiency and environmental impact\\n5of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems, including vehicle routing, traffic signal control,\\npassenger demand, and energy consumption.\\nA critical component of our methodology involved the development of a novel mathematical model\\nthat captured the complex interactions between autonomous vehicles, urban infrastructure, and\\npassenger behavior. The model was formulated as a stochastic optimization problem, where the\\nobjective function sought to minimize the overall carbon footprint of the transportation system while\\nsatisfying passenger demand and safety constraints. To solve this problem, we utilized a combination\\nof metaheuristic algorithms and machine learning techniques, which enabled us to explore a vast\\nsolution space and identify optimal configurations for autonomous vehicle deployment and routing.\\nIn addition to the mathematical modeling, we also conducted a series of simulation experiments to\\nevaluate the performance of our proposed framework under various scenarios. These simulations\\nwere performed using a custom-built platform that integrated autonomous vehicle simulators, traffic\\nmicrosimulators, and environmental impact assessment tools. The simulations allowed us to analyze\\nthe effects of different factors, such as autonomous vehicle penetration rates, traffic signal control\\nstrategies, and passenger demand patterns, on the overall sustainability of the transportation system.\\nFurthermore, we incorporated a range of unconventional factors into our simulations, including the\\nimpact of urban wildlife on autonomous vehicle navigation and the potential for autonomous vehicles\\nto be used as mobile urban gardens.\\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of our methodology involved the application of chaos theory and\\ncomplexity science principles to the analysis of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems. By\\ntreating the system as a complex, nonlinear network, we were able to identify emergent patterns and\\nbehaviors that would have been impossible to predict using traditional modeling approaches. This led\\nto some unexpected insights, such as the discovery that the optimal routing strategy for autonomous\\nvehicles is often equivalent to the shortest path in a fractal network. Moreover, our analysis revealed\\nthat the carbon footprint of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems can be minimized by\\nintentionally introducing small amounts of randomness into the routing algorithms, a phenomenon\\nthat we termed \"sustainable chaos.\"\\nThe empirical data collection phase of our methodology involved collaborating with several urban\\ntransportation agencies and autonomous vehicle manufacturers to gather real-world data on passenger\\ndemand, traffic patterns, and vehicle performance. This data was used to validate our mathematical\\nmodels and simulation results, as well as to identify areas for further improvement. We also\\nconducted a series of surveys and focus groups with passengers and transportation stakeholders to\\ngather feedback on the potential benefits and drawbacks of autonomous vehicle-based transportation\\nsystems. The results of these surveys revealed a surprising level of enthusiasm for the idea of\\nusing autonomous vehicles as mobile entertainment platforms, with many respondents expressing a\\nwillingness to pay a premium for the ability to watch movies or play video games during their daily\\ncommute.\\nTo further enhance the sustainability of autonomous vehicle-based transportation systems, we explored\\nthe potential for integrating these systems with other modes of transportation, such as public transit\\nand ride-sharing services. This involved developing a range of novel algorithms and protocols\\nfor coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles with other vehicles and transportation\\ninfrastructure. We also investigated the possibility of using autonomous vehicles as mobile energy\\nstorage devices, which could potentially help to stabilize the electrical grid and reduce the carbon\\nfootprint of urban energy systems. The results of our analysis suggested that this approach could be\\nparticularly effective in urban areas with high concentrations of renewable energy sources, such as\\nsolar or wind power.\\nIn conclusion, our methodology for sustainable urban transportation with autonomous vehicles was\\ncharacterized by a highly interdisciplinary and innovative approach, which integrated insights from\\ntransportation engineering, computer science, environmental science, and complexity theory. By\\ncombining theoretical modeling, simulation-based analysis, and empirical data collection, we were\\nable to develop a comprehensive framework for evaluating the sustainability of autonomous vehicle-\\nbased transportation systems and identifying opportunities for improvement. The unexpected and\\nsometimes bizarre results of our analysis, such as the potential for autonomous vehicles to be used as\\nmobile urban gardens or the benefits of introducing randomness into routing algorithms, highlight the\\nneed for continued innovation and experimentation in this field. Ultimately, our methodology provides\\na foundation for the development of more sustainable, efficient, and resilient urban transportation\\n6systems, which can help to mitigate the environmental impacts of urbanization and improve the\\nquality of life for urban residents.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo investigate the efficacy of nanosensor-based soil analysis for urban agriculture, a series of exper-\\niments were designed to evaluate the performance of these nanosensors in various soil types and\\nconditions. The experiments were conducted in a controlled laboratory setting, where the soil samples\\nwere carefully prepared and treated to mimic real-world urban agricultural scenarios. A total of 100\\nsoil samples were collected from different urban agricultural sites, including rooftops, community\\ngardens, and backyard farms. These samples were then categorized into five distinct groups based on\\ntheir texture, organic matter content, and pH levels.\\nEach soil sample was further subdivided into three smaller portions, which were then subjected to\\ndifferent treatments, including the addition of various nutrients, contaminants, and microorganisms.\\nThe nanosensors, which were designed to detect a range of soil parameters, including pH, nutrient\\nlevels, and moisture content, were then inserted into each soil portion. The nanosensors were equipped\\nwith advanced sensing technologies, including nanowires, nanotubes, and graphene-based sensors,\\nwhich enabled them to detect even minor changes in the soil conditions.\\nIn addition to the nanosensors, a range of traditional soil analysis techniques were also employed,\\nincluding spectroscopy, chromatography, and microscopy. These techniques were used to validate\\nthe accuracy and reliability of the nanosensor-based soil analysis system. The experiments were\\nconducted over a period of six months, during which time the soil samples were regularly monitored\\nand analyzed using both the nanosensors and traditional techniques.\\nOne of the most unusual approaches used in the experiments was the incorporation of musical\\nvibrations to enhance the sensitivity of the nanosensors. It was hypothesized that the vibrations from\\ncertain types of music could resonate with the nanosensors, allowing them to detect even subtle\\nchanges in the soil conditions. To test this hypothesis, the soil samples were exposed to a range of\\nmusical genres, including classical, jazz, and rock music. The results of these experiments were\\nsurprising, with some of the nanosensors showing a significant increase in sensitivity when exposed\\nto certain types of music.\\nThe experimental design also included a range of control groups, which were used to evaluate the\\npotential impact of various environmental factors on the nanosensor-based soil analysis system. These\\nfactors included temperature, humidity, and light intensity, all of which can potentially affect the\\naccuracy and reliability of the nanosensors. The control groups were designed to mimic real-world\\nurban agricultural scenarios, where the soil conditions can be highly variable and unpredictable.\\nTo further evaluate the performance of the nanosensor-based soil analysis system, a range of statistical\\nmodels were developed and applied to the experimental data. These models included linear regression,\\ndecision trees, and neural networks, all of which were used to identify patterns and relationships\\nin the data. The results of these analyses were used to refine and optimize the nanosensor-based\\nsoil analysis system, with the goal of developing a highly accurate and reliable system for urban\\nagricultural applications.\\nThe experiments also involved the use of advanced data visualization techniques, including 3D\\nprinting and virtual reality. These techniques were used to create highly detailed and interactive\\nmodels of the soil samples, which could be used to visualize and analyze the data in a more\\nintuitive and immersive way. The use of these techniques allowed the researchers to gain a deeper\\nunderstanding of the complex relationships between the soil parameters and the nanosensor-based\\nsoil analysis system.\\nIn terms of the specific experimental procedures, the soil samples were first prepared and treated as\\ndescribed above. The nanosensors were then inserted into each soil portion, and the soil samples\\nwere placed in a controlled environment chamber. The chamber was equipped with a range of sensors\\nand monitoring equipment, which were used to track the soil conditions and the performance of\\nthe nanosensors. The musical vibrations were applied to the soil samples using a specialized sound\\nsystem, which was designed to resonate with the nanosensors. The experiments were conducted in a\\nrandomized and replicated design, with multiple replicates of each treatment and control group.\\n7The results of the experiments were collected and analyzed using a range of software tools and\\nstatistical packages. The data were first cleaned and filtered to remove any errors or inconsistencies,\\nand then subjected to a range of statistical analyses, including hypothesis testing and regression\\nanalysis. The results of these analyses were used to draw conclusions about the performance and\\nefficacy of the nanosensor-based soil analysis system, and to identify areas for further research and\\ndevelopment.\\nTo present the results of the experiments in a clear and concise manner, a range of tables and figures\\nwere created. For example, the following table shows the results of the experiments, including the\\nmean and standard deviation of the soil parameters and the performance of the nanosensors: This\\nTable 1: Results of the Experiments\\nSoil Type pH Nutrient Levels Moisture Content Nanosensor Accuracy Musical Vibrations\\nClay 6.5 ± 0.5 10 ± 2 20 ± 5 90 ± 5% Classical\\nSilt 7.0 ± 0.5 15 ± 3 25 ± 5 85 ± 5% Jazz\\nSand 6.0 ± 0.5 5 ± 1 15 ± 5 80 ± 5% Rock\\nLoam 6.5 ± 0.5 12 ± 2 22 ± 5 92 ± 5% Classical\\nPeat 5.5 ± 0.5 8 ± 2 30 ± 5 88 ± 5% Jazz\\ntable shows the results of the experiments, including the mean and standard deviation of the soil\\nparameters and the performance of the nanosensors. The results indicate that the nanosensor-based\\nsoil analysis system was highly accurate and reliable, with a mean accuracy of 90±5% across all soil\\ntypes. The results also show that the musical vibrations had a significant impact on the performance\\nof the nanosensors, with certain types of music (e.g. classical) resulting in higher accuracy and\\nreliability.\\n5 Results\\nThe deployment of nanosensor-based soil analysis systems in urban agricultural settings has yielded a\\nplethora of intriguing results, warranting a comprehensive examination of the data collected. Initially,\\nthe nanosensors were calibrated to detect minute variations in soil composition, including pH levels,\\nnutrient content, and moisture saturation. The calibration process involved immersing the nanosensors\\nin a controlled soil environment with predetermined characteristics, allowing for the establishment of\\na baseline for subsequent measurements.\\nUpon deployment in urban agricultural plots, the nanosensors began transmitting data in real-time,\\nfacilitating the monitoring of soil conditions with unprecedented precision. The data revealed a\\nfascinating phenomenon, wherein the soil’s microbial ecosystem exhibited a symbiotic relationship\\nwith the nanosensors, effectively \"hacking\" into the sensors’ communication protocols to transmit their\\nown signals. This unexpected development prompted an investigation into the potential applications\\nof this phenomenon, including the possibility of leveraging the microbial ecosystem as a conduit for\\nsoil-nanosensor interfaces.\\nFurther analysis of the data revealed a statistically significant correlation between the nanosensors’\\nreadings and the yields of various crops, suggesting that the nanosensors could be used to predict\\noptimal harvesting times and fertilizer application schedules. However, an unconventional approach\\nwas also explored, wherein the nanosensors were used to generate a form of \"soil music\" by converting\\nthe sensor readings into audible sound waves. This innovative method, dubbed \"soil sonification,\" was\\nfound to have a profound impact on the crops, with certain sound frequencies apparently stimulating\\naccelerated growth and increased yields.\\nTo further explore the efficacy of soil sonification, a series of experiments were conducted, involving\\nthe exposure of crops to various sound wave frequencies and amplitudes. The results were nothing\\nshort of astonishing, with certain sound patterns eliciting remarkable responses from the crops,\\nincluding the formation of intricate, fractal-like patterns on the surface of leaves and the emission of\\nfaint, luminescent glows from the soil itself. While the scientific community may view these findings\\nwith a healthy dose of skepticism, the potential implications for urban agriculture are undeniable, and\\nwarrant further investigation.\\n8In an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms driving these phenomena, a team of\\nresearchers was assembled to conduct a thorough analysis of the nanosensor data and soil sonification\\nexperiments.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we must remain open\\nto new ideas, perspectives, and approaches, embracing the complexity and uncertainty of the research\\nendeavor, and striving to create a brighter, more sustainable future for all.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, the development and implementation of nanosensor-based soil analysis for urban\\nagriculture has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach sustainable farming practices in\\nmetropolitan areas. By leveraging the unique properties of nanomaterials, these sensors can detect\\neven the slightest changes in soil composition, allowing for real-time monitoring and adjustment of\\ncrop conditions. However, it is also crucial to consider the potential risks and challenges associated\\n9with the widespread adoption of this technology, including the possibility of nanosensor malfunction,\\nsoil contamination, and the impact on local ecosystems. Furthermore, the integration of nanosensor-\\nbased soil analysis with other emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of\\nThings, could lead to the creation of highly sophisticated and autonomous urban farming systems.\\nMoreover, the use of nanosensors in soil analysis could also enable the development of novel farming\\npractices, such as precision agriculture, which involves the precise application of water, nutrients, and\\npesticides to specific areas of the soil. This approach has the potential to significantly reduce waste,\\nincrease crop yields, and minimize the environmental impact of farming. In addition, the real-time\\ndata provided by nanosensors could be used to develop advanced predictive models of soil behavior,\\nallowing farmers to anticipate and prepare for potential problems, such as soil erosion, nutrient\\ndepletion, and pest infestations. It is also worth noting that the application of nanosensor-based\\nsoil analysis is not limited to traditional farming practices, but could also be used in non-traditional\\nsettings, such as urban gardens, green roofs, and vertical farms. In these environments, the use of\\nnanosensors could help to optimize soil conditions, reduce maintenance costs, and increase crop\\nyields, making urban agriculture a more viable and sustainable option for urban populations. On\\nthe other hand, a more unorthodox approach to nanosensor-based soil analysis could involve the\\nuse of nanosensors to detect and analyze the unique energy signatures emitted by plants, which\\ncould be used to develop a new form of plant-based communication. This approach, while highly\\nspeculative, could potentially revolutionize our understanding of plant behavior and intelligence,\\nand could have significant implications for the development of more sustainable and harmonious\\nfarming practices. Additionally, the development of nanosensor-based soil analysis could also be\\ninfluenced by the principles of chaos theory, which suggests that complex systems, such as soil\\necosystems, are inherently unpredictable and prone to sudden, dramatic changes. By embracing\\nthis unpredictability, and using nanosensors to monitor and analyze the complex interactions within\\nsoil ecosystems, farmers and researchers could develop a more nuanced and dynamic understanding\\nof soil behavior, and could potentially uncover new and innovative approaches to soil management\\nand optimization. The potential applications of nanosensor-based soil analysis are vast and varied,\\nand could have significant impacts on a wide range of fields, from agriculture and environmental\\nscience, to materials science and engineering. As this technology continues to evolve and mature,\\nit will be important to consider the potential risks and benefits, as well as the social and economic\\nimplications, of widespread adoption. By taking a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach\\nto the development and implementation of nanosensor-based soil analysis, we can unlock the full\\npotential of this technology, and create a more sustainable, productive, and resilient food system for\\ngenerations to come. Ultimately, the future of nanosensor-based soil analysis will depend on our\\nability to balance the potential benefits of this technology with the potential risks and challenges,\\nand to develop innovative and effective solutions to the complex problems associated with urban\\nagriculture. By embracing a holistic and integrated approach to soil analysis, and by considering the\\ncomplex interactions between soil, plants, and the environment, we can create a more sustainable,\\nequitable, and food-secure future for all. The implications of nanosensor-based soil analysis are\\nfar-reaching and profound, and could have significant impacts on the way we think about and interact\\nwith the natural world.

In the context of urban agriculture, the use of nanosensor-based\\nsoil analysis could also be combined with other emerging technologies, such as biotechnology\\nand genomics, to develop new and innovative approaches to crop breeding and soil management.\\nFor example, nanosensors could be used to detect and analyze the unique genetic signatures of\\ndifferent plant varieties, allowing farmers to select and breed crops that are optimized for specific\\nsoil conditions and environmental factors. This approach could also be used to develop novel soil\\namendments and fertilizers, which are tailored to the specific needs of individual crops and soil\\ntypes.

       "  'file_content': 'Short-Term Forecasting of Precipitation Using Satellite Data\\nAbstract\\nShort-range forecasting of rain or snow, known as precipitation nowcasting, is typically displayed on geographical\\nmaps by weather services for up to a 2-hour timeframe. Current methods for precipitation nowcasting predomi-\\nnantly use the extrapolation of ground-based radar observations, employing techniques like optical flow or neural\\nnetworks. However, the effectiveness of these methods is geographically restricted to areas surrounding radar\\ninstallations. This paper introduces a novel precipitation nowcasting technique that utilizes geostationary satellite\\nimagery. This method has been integrated into the Yandex.Weather precipitation map, which includes an alert\\nsystem with push notifications for Yandex ecosystem products. The integration of satellite imagery significantly\\nbroadens the coverage area, marking a step towards developing a comprehensive global nowcasting service.\\n1 Introduction\\nWeather conditions significantly impact the daily routines and planning of urban populations. Similar to how ancient humans\\nrelied on environmental cues for hunting, modern individuals adjust their daily and leisure activities based on the likelihood of\\nrain or cloud cover. Weather forecasting services provide essential data, including temperature, precipitation intensity and type,\\ncloudiness, humidity, pressure, and wind conditions. These services offer current weather updates, short-term predictions up to 2\\nhours (nowcasting), medium-range forecasts up to 10 days, and long-range predictions spanning several months.\\nA crucial component of weather services is the precipitation map, which combines radar data with neural network-based, very\\nshort-term precipitation forecasting to deliver a detailed map of anticipated precipitation for the next two hours, updated every 10\\nminutes. This feature enables personalized, user-friendly notifications, such as alerts about impending rain. The popularity of this\\nfeature is evident, as it significantly influences user engagement and reliance on weather services.\\nThe information from the precipitation map is used to refine current weather condition reports (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy) on the main\\nweather website. Additionally, partners and offline users, including radio and television, depend on this data, effectively doubling the\\naudience for the precipitation nowcasting product.\\nTraditional weather forecasting, which involves numerical modeling of the atmosphere, cannot accurately predict exact rain locations\\non short time scales. For instance, it struggles to determine which part of a city will be affected by rain within the next hour.\\nMoreover, traditional methods provide hourly updates, making it difficult to pinpoint brief periods without rain during short, intense\\nprecipitation events. People often need straightforward answers to simple questions like when it will rain or stop raining, requiring\\nspecific predictions such as \"heavy rain will start in 10 minutes and last for 30 minutes.\"\\nConventional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are limited in their ability to forecast precipitation events at specific\\nlocations and times. Radar extrapolation products are effective for the first couple of hours but fail to predict precipitation accurately\\ndue to physical processes. Consequently, the current trend in nowcasting is to merge high-resolution radar data with traditional NWP\\nmodels.\\nHowever, radar-based products are limited by the location of radar installations and are not easily scalable. Radars are costly, their\\ninstallation requires governmental and public approval, and their operation needs trained personnel. Coverage is particularly sparse\\nin large, unevenly populated countries like Russia, where many remote areas lack the necessary infrastructure. Similar challenges\\nexist in many developing countries that need weather services but lack the infrastructure for radar networks.\\nThe objective of this research is to develop and implement a practical system for precipitation nowcasting that relies on satellite\\nimagery and NWP products. The goal is to replicate the precipitation fields obtained from radar using satellite data and then to\\nprovide nowcasting over a much larger area using a similar predictive model. The system’s effectiveness is validated by comparing\\npredicted precipitation with data from ground-based weather stations. The primary focus areas with limited radar coverage are the\\nSiberian and Ural federal districts of Russia, which have a combined population of approximately 30 million.2 Related Work\\nThis section provides an overview of related work, divided into two main parts corresponding to the primary components of our\\npipeline.\\n2.1 Precipitation detection\\nThe global and continuous coverage offered by geostationary satellite imagery makes it a highly desirable data source for precipitation\\nnowcasting algorithms. Since satellites do not directly observe rainfall, precipitation data must be extracted using heuristic or\\nmachine learning methods. This extraction can be framed as either precipitation estimation (regression) or precipitation detection\\n(binary classification). This paper concentrates on the binary classification approach to precipitation detection.\\nThe interaction of light with the atmosphere, specifically absorption and scattering, is governed by established physical principles.\\nThese principles can be used to develop heuristics for detecting precipitation. One such implementation is the multi-sensor\\nprecipitation estimate (MPE), which is, however, limited to detecting convective rain and may produce inaccurate results in\\nareas with other forms of precipitation. This limitation is particularly significant in middle and high latitudes, where convective\\nprecipitation is predominantly a summer phenomenon resulting from surface heating, leading to the formation of cumulonimbus\\nclouds and heavy rainfall. During much of the year, frontal precipitation, driven by cyclonic movements and interactions between\\nwarm and cold fronts, is more common. The MPE algorithm often fails to capture these frontal precipitation events.\\nA more advanced physics-based heuristic is the precipitation properties (PP) algorithm, which integrates NWP model data, cloud\\nphysical properties, and satellite measurements. This algorithm uses radar observations to calibrate its parameters. However, because\\nit relies on satellite observations at visible wavelengths to determine cloud properties, it can only retrieve precipitation data during\\ndaylight hours.\\nMachine learning techniques, including decision trees, neural networks, and SVMs, have been evaluated for precipitation detection.\\nHowever, these studies often used pixel-wise data splits for training and testing, which may lead to overfitting due to neglecting\\nthe spatial and temporal smoothness of atmospheric phenomena. While these studies examined day, twilight, and night conditions\\nseparately, with the best results during the day, a more sophisticated method using a fully-connected stacked denoising autoencoder\\nhas also been applied to precipitation detection. Although the autoencoder’s unsupervised training helps mitigate overfitting, there is\\nno comparison with other architectures.\\nFrom a machine learning perspective, precipitation detection is similar to semantic segmentation, where a multichannel image is\\ninput, and each pixel is assigned an output label. Convolutional neural networks have become the standard for semantic segmentation\\nin recent years, making them a natural choice for precipitation detection as well.\\nConvolutional neural networks have been effectively used in various satellite image processing tasks, such as road and building\\ndetection. Despite numerous public challenges that have advanced the field, the range of architectures used for aerial image\\nprocessing remains narrower compared to those used for semantic segmentation datasets like Microsoft COCO or Cityscapes. A\\ncommon issue in these datasets is the presence of objects of the same class at different scales, which has led to the development\\nof multiscale approaches. However, these approaches are less applicable to precipitation detection and other satellite imagery\\ntasks, as the distance between the sensor and the Earth’s surface is usually known. Consequently, simpler models like UNet and\\nfully-convolutional ResNet remain relevant.\\n2.2 Nowcasting\\nPrecipitation nowcasting is typically accomplished in two stages by extrapolating radar observations. Initially, wind patterns are\\nestimated by comparing multiple precipitation fields captured by radar. The techniques used for this in meteorology are similar to\\noptical flow estimation algorithms in computer vision. Subsequently, the precipitation field is moved according to the estimated\\nwind directions.\\nA novel approach to nowcasting using a convolutional recurrent neural network (Conv-LSTM) was introduced and later refined.\\nWhile this neural network adds complexity, it can theoretically improve rainfall prediction accuracy by accounting for radar artifacts\\nand the appearance or disappearance of precipitation areas. However, the most significant of these processes, the vanishing of\\nprecipitation, can also be managed by adding basic filtering to the optical flow method.\\n3 Methodology\\nThis section details the methodology used for precipitation detection and nowcasting, focusing on data preprocessing, model training,\\nand evaluation metrics.\\n23.1 Data Sources\\nPrecipitation nowcasting imposes distinct data requirements compared to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), including high\\nspatial and temporal resolution, direct rainfall measurement, and global coverage. Since no single source can fulfill all these\\nrequirements, it is necessary to combine multiple data sources.\\nWeather stations provide direct precipitation observations, typically measuring accumulated precipitation every 12 hours according\\nto the SYNOP protocol. Although many stations report more frequently, usually every 3 hours, this frequency is insufficient for\\nnowcasting due to the lack of detailed spatial and temporal data needed to generate high-resolution precipitation fields.\\nRadar observations are the primary source of high-resolution precipitation data. The Russian network of DMRL-C radars, operated\\nby Roshydromet, uses C-band Doppler technology to measure raindrop reflectivity and radial velocity. Each radar covers a circular\\narea with a radius of up to 250 km and 10 km above the ground, with accuracy diminishing with distance. The radar echo can be\\nconverted to surface precipitation using the Marshall-Palmer relation. The resulting precipitation field has a resolution of 2 x 2 km,\\nwith scans repeated every ten minutes. However, radar coverage is limited, especially outside densely populated areas of Europe and\\nNorth America, with most Russian radars located in the western part of the country.\\nLow Earth orbit satellites equipped with radars and sensors provide another source of precipitation measurements. These satellites\\nscan a narrow band beneath their orbital path, offering global coverage in the sense that every location within a certain latitude range\\nis eventually scanned. However, the time between consecutive passes of a single satellite can be quite long. The Global Precipitation\\nMeasurements (GPM) mission, operated by NASA and JAXA, uses a constellation of about 10 operational satellites to provide\\nglobal precipitation coverage from 65°S to 65°N with a 3-hour temporal resolution.\\nGeostationary satellites are widely used for weather observation. Positioned 35,786 km above the equator, these satellites match the\\nEarth’s rotation, allowing continuous monitoring of a large area. However, at such altitudes, the only feasible instrument for cloud\\nand precipitation detection is a high-resolution imager that captures visible and infrared spectrum snapshots. Accurately detecting\\nprecipitation from these images is challenging. Previous studies on this topic have not achieved the accuracy needed for user-facing\\nproducts that aim to alert users about precipitation within 10 minutes.\\nThis study uses data from the Meteosat-8 satellite, operated by EUMETSAT, positioned over the Indian Ocean at 41.5° longitude,\\ncovering the western part of Russia and Europe. The SEVIRI instrument on Meteosat-8 scans the Earth’s surface in 12 channels,\\nwith a spatial resolution of 3 km per pixel and a full scan time of 15 minutes.\\nThis paper describes a precipitation nowcasting system that integrates radar, satellite, and NWP model data. A new approach to\\nprecipitation detection is introduced and its accuracy is demonstrated.\\n3.2 Precipitation Detection\\nThe approach to precipitation detection is summarized in Table 1. The key components of the pipeline are described in detail in the\\nfollowing subsections.\\nTable 1: Summary of our precipitation detection approach.\\nInput features Satellite imagery, GFS fields, solar altitude, topography\\nGround truth Binarized radar measurements\\nModel UNet\\nLoss function Binary crossentropy + Dice loss\\nEvaluation measure F1 score\\n3.2.1 Preprocessing\\nThe data preparation process involves several steps aimed at minimizing the discrepancies between different data domains.\\nRadar data preprocessing begins by discarding radar observations taken beyond 200 km from the radar, as these are deemed\\nunreliable. Subsequently, observations from various radars are consolidated onto a single map, resolving any conflicts between\\nradars with overlapping coverage areas. Due to frequent false negatives in radar observations, the maximum value between two data\\npoints is used for aggregation. Finally, radar observations are binarized using three thresholds: 0.08 mm/h for light rain, 0.5 mm/h\\nfor moderate rain, and 2.5 mm/h for heavy rain.\\nSatellite images and radar observations are remapped onto a uniform grid using an equirectangular projection. Given the oblique\\nobservation angles and the fact that precipitation can occur up to 2 km above the ground, there can be a parallax shift of up to 3\\npixels between radar and satellite data. However, in practice, accurately estimating precipitation height is complex, and accounting\\nfor parallax did not improve the alignment.\\nSatellite and radar data have different observation frequencies: satellite images are available every 15 minutes, while radar images\\nare available every 10 minutes. To align these data sources temporally, a frame rate conversion is implemented using optical\\nflow interpolation. The goal is to match the radar data’s temporal resolution, so satellite data is converted to a 10-minute time\\n3step. However, optical flow cannot be directly computed from satellite imagery due to the presence of both transient atmospheric\\nphenomena and the permanent underlying relief. This issue is circumvented by performing precipitation detection before the optical\\nflow step, allowing the optical flow to be computed directly from the precipitation detection results, which do not include the relief.\\nTo generate the missing image It between two adjacent anchor images taken at times t0 and t1, the following equation is used:\\nIt(r) =aIt0 (r + bu01) +bIt1 (r + au10)\\nwhere a = t1−t\\nt1−t0\\nand b = t−t0\\nt1−t0\\nare coefficients dependent on the time of the generated image, and u01 and u10 are the forward and\\nbackward optical flows, computed using the TV-L1 optical flow algorithm implemented in OpenCV .\\nRoshydromet radars record the timestamp at the end of a scan, whereas EUMETSAT marks the start. Since the Earth is scanned in a\\nseries of lateral sweeps starting from the south, the actual observation time varies with latitude, with northern latitudes observed\\nlast. The combined discrepancy between timestamps can reach 20 minutes. Experimental validation has confirmed that this value\\ncorresponds to the minimum discrepancy between radar data and precipitation field reconstruction.\\nAdditional features are incorporated into the satellite imagery to enhance the signal. The Global Forecast System (GFS) model\\nis used to provide a comprehensive description of atmospheric conditions, including physical properties not easily inferred from\\nsatellite imagery. The GFS model produces forecasts four times a day with a spatial resolution of 0.25 ° x 0.25° and temporal\\nintervals of 3 hours. Key fields from GFS include convective precipitation rate, cloud work function, cloud water, precipitable water,\\nand convective potential energy at different levels. Additionally, a topography map and solar altitude data are included as features.\\n3.2.2 Training\\nA modified UNet architecture is employed as the primary model for precipitation detection. Through testing, it was determined\\nthat using 5 upsample/downsample blocks, compared to the original 4, yields the best results on the validation dataset. The model\\nutilizes standard 3x3 convolutions, 2x2 pooling, and batch normalization layers. The number of channels begins at 16 in the first\\nblock and doubles with each downsampling step. This reduced number of channels helps mitigate overfitting and accelerates training\\nand evaluation.\\nThe network is trained for 250,000 iterations using the Adam algorithm, with an initial learning rate of 10−4, which is reduced by a\\nfactor of 10 after 200,000 iterations. The addition of the Dice loss to the standard binary cross-entropy improves the F1 scores for\\nthe converged model. Training is performed using the Keras framework with a TensorFlow backend and Horovod for multi-GPU\\nlearning.\\nThe model is trained to detect three levels of precipitation (light, medium, and heavy) simultaneously, producing three output maps\\nwith binary classification loss applied to each map independently.\\nTypically, precipitation estimation algorithms are developed separately for day, twilight, and night conditions. However, this\\nseparation is challenging for machine learning in high-latitude zones due to the underrepresentation of night during summer and day\\nduring winter, making it difficult to compile a balanced dataset. Therefore, a single model is trained, with solar altitude provided as\\nan additional input feature.\\nOverfitting is a significant concern due to the limited geographical area of the dataset. The network can easily memorize the relief,\\nwhich is visible in some wavelengths even if not explicitly provided as a feature, and use it to overfit on ground truth labels within\\nthe radar coverage areas. Moreover, memorizing the correspondence between geographical location and output labels may cause the\\nmodel to ignore areas outside radar coverage, leading to constant output in these regions. This contradicts the goal of extending\\nnowcasting beyond radar coverage. To address this, the model is trained on relatively small data crops (96x96 pixels).\\nDue to the large number of channels in the input data, which is atypical for computer vision problems, data loading can be slow. To\\nmanage this, a small batch of 5 multi-channel images (including all additional features) is loaded, and each image is then cropped 10\\ntimes at random locations.\\n3.2.3 Metrics\\nThis section presents the evaluation metrics for the precipitation detection algorithm. Due to class imbalance, standard classification\\naccuracy is not informative. Therefore, the primary metric used is the F1 score, averaged across temporal and spatial dimensions.\\nSeveral approaches are compared:\\n- **UNet with GFS**: The UNet architecture with a complete set of features, trained as described earlier. - **UNet w/o GFS**: The\\nsame UNet approach without GFS features. - **Pointwise**: A neural network with two convolutional layers using 1x1 convolutions,\\nequivalent to a pointwise perceptron model. GFS features are not used in this model. - **PP and MPE**: Physics-based algorithms\\n(Precipitation Properties and Multi-sensor Precipitation Estimate).\\nGiven that PP and MPE algorithms are designed for daylight conditions, the metrics are also averaged separately for day, night, and\\ntwilight periods. The neural network approaches consistently outperform the physics-based methods across all time periods and\\nmetrics. The generally poor performance of PP and MPE in these experiments may be due to their tuning for predicting convective\\nrainfall aggregated over extended periods, which does not align with the requirements of this service.\\n4The pointwise model’s performance falls between that of UNet and the physics-based approaches. Since it is trained on radar data, it\\ndetects similar types of precipitation and performs well during testing.\\nThe UNet architecture’s superiority over the pointwise model likely stems from its ability to gather information from a large\\nreceptive field. While precipitation reconstruction does not require the same extent of multiscale data processing as many semantic\\nsegmentation tasks, the interconnectedness of adjacent atmospheric locations makes a large receptive field beneficial for precipitation\\ndetection.\\nFinally, the addition of GFS features further enhances the F1 score of the UNet model, as demonstrated in the results.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Nowcasting\\nUpon completing the reconstruction of the precipitation field in the area of interest, a separate algorithm is employed to forecast future\\nprecipitation fields based on several consecutive reconstructed fields. Two options are considered for this algorithm: extrapolation\\nwith optical flow, as used for frame rate conversion, and a convolutional neural network previously developed for radar data\\nprediction. The network consists of a sequence of blocks, each modeling the extrapolation process with optical flow via a spatial\\ntransformer layer. Although the neural network’s prediction mechanism is intentionally similar, end-to-end learning on real data\\ntheoretically allows it to surpass the performance of simpler algorithms. While the neural network approach was found to be superior\\nin the single radar setting, preliminary experiments did not show the same success with composited radar images and satellite data.\\nDespite the optical flow approach being simpler and not requiring retraining with the introduction of new data sources, it is believed\\nthat neural nowcasting remains promising and could outperform simpler techniques with proper tuning of the network architecture\\nand training regimen.\\n5 Results\\n5.1 Post-Launch Performance\\nAlthough the satellite-based rain detection model was trained to match radar fields, its reception by users was uncertain. A/B testing\\nalone was insufficient to evaluate the product’s performance, as it was essentially a new feature for several regions of Russia and\\ncould be well-received initially even if the map quality was low. Therefore, the performance of the new precipitation map was\\nassessed using ground station data. While the optimal metrics for a user-facing precipitation prediction algorithm are still debated,\\nthere was evidence of the nowcasting product’s popularity, and the aim was to replicate the properties of the radar-based precipitation\\nmap using satellite data. Specifically, the radar data differs from longer-term forecasts based on proprietary Meteum technology in\\nhaving higher accuracy and lower systematic error rates (precipitation imbalance) at the cost of a lower F1 score when compared to\\nground station weather observations. The same comparison strategy was used to evaluate the performance of the new satellite-based\\nrain detection algorithm over the federal districts of Russia. Results showed that while the accuracy of the satellite-based product is\\nlower than that of radar, it is still better than traditional forecasts, with precipitation imbalance and F1 scores similar to those for\\nradar. It is important to note that the radar located in Siberia was used only for verification at this stage; its data was not included in\\nthe training dataset. This comparison allows for evaluating precipitation detection quality in regions without radar observation.\\nThis result confirmed the success of the new rain map. Additionally, A/B testing on users showed a statistically significant increase\\nin daily active users (DAU) in areas where the rain map was previously unavailable (Siberia and Ural regions), justifying its rollout\\nin late September.\\nTable 2: Comparison of precipitation detection methods with various metrics averaged over time.\\nMethod Accuracy F1 Score Precision Recall\\nMPE 0.92 0.21 0.28 0.17\\nPP 0.86 0.30 0.24 0.40\\nPointwise 0.91 0.48 0.40 0.61\\nU-Net w/o GFS 0.94 0.56 0.64 0.50\\nU-Net with GFS 0.94 0.60 0.62 0.59\\n6 Conclusion\\nA precipitation nowcasting system has been developed, implemented, and launched, utilizing both ground-based radar observations\\nand geostationary satellite imagery.

By leveraging the principles of swarm intelligence, our\\nresearch endeavors to tap into the intrinsic unpredictability of insect colonies,\\nthereby generating a unique symbiosis between the audience, performers, and the\\nartificial environment. Theoretically, this synergy is expected to induce a state of\\nemotional hyperarousal, wherein the crowd’s collective emotional resonance is\\namplified and manipulated through the strategic deployment of swarm-inspired\\nlighting patterns. Interestingly, our preliminary findings suggest that the incorpora-\\ntion of chaotic insect behavior can, in fact, yield a paradoxical sense of cohesion\\nand unity among the audience members, despite the apparent lack of logical co-\\nherence in the resulting lighting configurations. Furthermore, we observed that\\nthe audience’s emotional responses were, at times, more intensely influenced by\\nthe swarm’s erratic movements than by the actual theatrical performance, raising\\nintriguing questions about the role of entropy and unpredictability in shaping the\\nhuman emotional experience. The exploration of entomological hyperreality, as a\\nmeans of theatrical expression, also led us to investigate the potential applications\\nof insect-inspired algorithms in the realm of emotional crowd control, where the\\nswarm’s collective behavior is used to subtly manipulate the audience’s emotional\\nstate, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop that blurs the distinction between the\\nobserver and the observed. Ultimately, our research aims to push the boundaries of\\nhuman-insect interaction, challenging traditional notions of performance, spectacle,\\nand the human experience, while navigating the uncharted territories of swarm\\nintelligence, chaos theory, and the intricacies of the human emotional psyche.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe convergence of entomological hyperreality and theatrical performance has led to a fascinating\\narea of study, where the collective behavior of insect swarms is leveraged to create immersive and\\ndynamic stage lighting experiences. By harnessing the principles of swarm intelligence, it is possible\\nto generate complex patterns and movements that can be used to manipulate the emotional state\\nof the audience, inducing a range of emotions from euphoria to nostalgia. This phenomenon has\\nbeen observed in various forms of performance art, where the incorporation of swarm-based lighting\\ndesigns has been shown to enhance the overall aesthetic and emotional impact of the production.\\nOne of the key challenges in this field is the development of algorithms that can effectively translate\\nthe behavior of insect swarms into a language that can be understood by theatrical lighting systems.\\nTo address this challenge, researchers have been exploring the use of machine learning techniques,\\nsuch as neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, to generate swarm-inspired lighting patterns\\nthat can be adapted to different performance contexts. For instance, a recent study found that the useof ant colony optimization algorithms can be used to create complex lighting patterns that mimic the\\nbehavior of fireflies, which can be used to create a sense of enchantment and wonder in the audience.\\nHowever, the application of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting is not without its limitations\\nand paradoxes. For example, the use of swarm-based lighting designs can sometimes create an sense\\nof disorientation and confusion in the audience, particularly if the patterns and movements are too\\ncomplex or unpredictable. Furthermore, the incorporation of swarm intelligence into theatrical\\nperformance can also raise questions about the role of human agency and creativity in the artistic\\nprocess, as the use of algorithmic systems can sometimes be seen as diminishing the importance of\\nhuman intuition and imagination.\\nIn an unexpected twist, some researchers have been exploring the use of swarm intelligence in\\ntheatrical stage lighting as a means of inducing a state of collective hysteria in the audience, where\\nthe use of complex lighting patterns and movements can be used to create a sense of shared frenzy\\nand excitement. This approach has been inspired by the behavior of certain insect species, such as\\nlocusts and grasshoppers, which are known to exhibit collective behavior that can be characterized as\\nfrenzy or hysteria. By harnessing the power of swarm intelligence, it is possible to create lighting\\ndesigns that can induce a similar state of collective frenzy in the audience, which can be used to\\nenhance the overall emotional impact of the performance.\\nThe study of entomological hyperreality in theatrical stage lighting also raises important questions\\nabout the relationship between technology and art, and the ways in which the use of algorithmic\\nsystems can be used to enhance or diminish the human experience. For example, the use of swarm-\\nbased lighting designs can be seen as a means of creating a more immersive and engaging experience\\nfor the audience, but it can also be seen as a means of manipulating the audience’s emotions and\\nperceptions, which raises important ethical considerations. Furthermore, the incorporation of swarm\\nintelligence into theatrical performance can also be seen as a means of challenging traditional notions\\nof creativity and artistry, as the use of algorithmic systems can sometimes be seen as diminishing the\\nimportance of human intuition and imagination.\\nIn a bizarre and unexpected turn of events, some researchers have been exploring the use of swarm\\nintelligence in theatrical stage lighting as a means of communicating with extraterrestrial life forms,\\nwhere the use of complex lighting patterns and movements can be used to convey messages and ideas\\nto other forms of intelligent life in the universe. This approach has been inspired by the behavior of\\ncertain insect species, such as fireflies and glowworms, which are known to use bioluminescence to\\ncommunicate with other members of their species. By harnessing the power of swarm intelligence,\\nit is possible to create lighting designs that can be used to convey complex messages and ideas to\\nother forms of intelligent life, which raises important questions about the potential for inter-species\\ncommunication and collaboration.\\nThe application of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting also has important implications for\\nour understanding of the human brain and its response to complex visual stimuli. For example, the\\nuse of swarm-based lighting designs can be used to create complex patterns and movements that can\\nbe used to stimulate the brain’s visual cortex, inducing a range of emotions and perceptions in the\\naudience. Furthermore, the incorporation of swarm intelligence into theatrical performance can also\\nbe used to create a sense of collective unconscious, where the audience is able to tap into a shared\\nreservoir of archetypes and emotions that are common to all humans. This approach has been inspired\\nby the work of Carl Jung, who believed that the collective unconscious was a shared reservoir of\\narchetypes and emotions that are common to all humans, and that it could be accessed through the\\nuse of certain visual and symbolic stimuli.\\nOverall, the study of entomological hyperreality in theatrical stage lighting is a complex and mul-\\ntifaceted field that raises important questions about the relationship between technology and art,\\nthe role of human agency and creativity in the artistic process, and the potential for inter-species\\ncommunication and collaboration. By harnessing the power of swarm intelligence, it is possible\\nto create complex lighting designs that can be used to manipulate the emotions and perceptions of\\nthe audience, inducing a range of emotions and perceptions that can be used to enhance the overall\\naesthetic and emotional impact of the performance. However, the application of swarm intelligence in\\ntheatrical stage lighting is not without its limitations and paradoxes, and it raises important questions\\nabout the potential risks and benefits of using algorithmic systems in the artistic process.\\n22 Related Work\\nThe realm of entomological hyperreality, where the boundaries between the natural and artificial\\nworlds are increasingly blurred, has garnered significant attention in recent years. At the intersection\\nof swarm intelligence, theatrical stage lighting, and emotional crowd control lies a complex and\\nmultifaceted domain, replete with opportunities for innovation and discovery. Research has shown\\nthat the collective behavior of swarm systems, such as those exhibited by insects, can be leveraged to\\ncreate complex and dynamic lighting patterns, capable of evoking powerful emotional responses in\\nhuman audiences.\\nOne intriguing approach to this field involves the use of ant colonies as a model for adaptive lighting\\nsystems. By studying the pheromone-based communication protocols employed by ants, researchers\\nhave developed novel algorithms for optimizing lighting configurations in real-time, taking into\\naccount factors such as audience density, emotional state, and environmental conditions. This has led\\nto the creation of immersive and interactive lighting experiences, wherein the audience is seamlessly\\nintegrated into the performance environment, blurring the lines between spectator and participant.\\nIn a seemingly unrelated yet fascinating tangent, studies have also explored the potential of using\\ninsect-based systems for the creation of sonic landscapes. By analyzing the vibrational frequencies\\nproduced by certain species of beetles, researchers have developed novel sound synthesis techniques,\\ncapable of generating a wide range of tonal colors and textures. These sounds, when integrated into\\nthe theatrical experience, have been shown to have a profound impact on audience emotional state,\\ninducing states of deep relaxation, heightened arousal, or even euphoria.\\nFurthermore, investigations into the realm of swarm intelligence have led to the development of novel\\nmethods for crowd control and emotional manipulation. By analyzing the collective behavior of insect\\nswarms, researchers have identified key patterns and dynamics that can be leveraged to influence\\nhuman crowd behavior. This has led to the creation of sophisticated systems for predicting and\\nmitigating crowd disturbances, as well as techniques for inducing specific emotional states in large\\ngroups of people. For instance, by releasing specific pheromone-like substances into the environment,\\nresearchers have been able to induce a state of collective euphoria in audiences, characterized by\\nincreased laughter, applause, and overall enthusiasm.\\nIn a more esoteric vein, some researchers have explored the potential of using entomological hyperre-\\nality as a means of accessing and manipulating the collective unconscious. By creating immersive and\\ndreamlike environments, replete with insect-inspired visuals and sounds, participants have reported\\nexperiencing profound insights, visions, and emotional releases. These experiences, while difficult\\nto quantify or replicate, have been likened to shamanic journeys, wherein the participant is able to\\naccess and integrate previously unconscious aspects of their psyche.\\nAdditionally, the use of fractal geometry and self-similarity in the creation of insect-inspired lighting\\npatterns has been shown to have a profound impact on audience perception and emotional state. By\\ncreating intricate and recursive patterns, reminiscent of the natural world, researchers have been able\\nto induce states of deep relaxation, increased focus, and heightened creativity in audiences. This has\\nled to the development of novel therapeutic techniques, wherein patients are exposed to fractal-based\\nlighting environments, designed to promote emotional healing and balance.\\nThe incorporation of swarm intelligence into theatrical stage lighting has also raised important\\nquestions regarding the nature of creativity, authorship, and artistic agency. As lighting systems\\nbecome increasingly autonomous and adaptive, the role of the human designer or artist is called into\\nquestion. Are these systems truly creative, or are they simply executing a set of pre-programmed\\ninstructions? Can we consider the swarm itself as a form of collective artist, working in tandem with\\nhuman collaborators to create novel and unprecedented works of art? These questions, while complex\\nand multifaceted, have significant implications for our understanding of the creative process and the\\nrole of technology in artistic expression.\\nIn another unexpected direction, researchers have begun to explore the potential of using insect-\\ninspired swarm intelligence for the creation of complex and adaptive narrative structures. By\\nanalyzing the social dynamics and communication protocols of insect colonies, researchers have\\ndeveloped novel methods for generating interactive and dynamic storylines, capable of responding\\nto audience input and feedback. This has led to the creation of immersive and engaging theatrical\\n3experiences, wherein the audience is able to influence the narrative in real-time, creating a unique\\nand collaborative storytelling environment.\\nThe application of entomological hyperreality to the domain of emotional crowd control has also\\nraised important ethical considerations. As researchers develop increasingly sophisticated systems\\nfor manipulating audience emotional state, questions arise regarding the potential misuse of these\\ntechnologies. Could they be used to manipulate or control large groups of people, inducing specific\\nemotional states for nefarious purposes? How can we ensure that these technologies are used\\nresponsibly and for the greater good? These questions, while complex and challenging, must be\\ncarefully considered as we move forward in this rapidly evolving field.\\nIn a bizarre yet fascinating twist, some researchers have begun to explore the potential of using insect-\\ninspired swarm intelligence for the creation of novel forms of performance art. By training insects\\nto perform specific tasks or behaviors, researchers have been able to create intricate and complex\\nperformances, featuring hundreds or even thousands of individual insects. These performances, while\\noften unpredictable and unpredictable, have been likened to a form of insect-based ballet, featuring\\nintricate choreography and dramatic flair.\\nOverall, the realm of entomological hyperreality offers a rich and fascinating domain for exploration\\nand discovery, replete with opportunities for innovation and creativity. As researchers continue to\\npush the boundaries of this field, we can expect to see the development of increasingly sophisticated\\nand adaptive systems, capable of manipulating and influencing audience emotional state in profound\\nand unprecedented ways. Whether through the use of swarm intelligence, fractal geometry, or insect-\\ninspired narrative structures, the potential applications of this technology are vast and multifaceted,\\nwith significant implications for the future of theatrical performance, crowd control, and emotional\\nmanipulation.\\n3 Methodology\\nThe development of a swarm intelligence system for theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd\\ncontrol is grounded in the principles of entomological hyperreality, where the boundaries between\\nreality and simulation are deliberately blurred to create an immersive experience. To achieve this, we\\nemployed a multi-faceted approach that combined insights from insect behavior, artificial intelligence,\\nand theatrical design. Initially, we conducted an exhaustive study of various insect species, including\\nbees, ants, and butterflies, to understand their communication patterns, social structures, and collective\\ndecision-making processes. This involved observing and recording the behavior of these insects in\\ncontrolled laboratory settings, as well as in their natural habitats, to identify patterns and traits that\\ncould be applied to the development of a swarm intelligence system.\\nOne of the key challenges in this approach was translating the complex social behaviors of insects into\\na language that could be understood and replicated by artificial intelligence algorithms. To address\\nthis, we developed a novel framework that utilized a combination of machine learning techniques,\\nincluding neural networks and evolutionary algorithms, to simulate the behavior of insect swarms.\\nThis framework, which we termed \"Entomological Hyperreality Simulator\" (EHS), allowed us to\\nmodel and predict the behavior of insect swarms in various scenarios, including foraging, migration,\\nand predator avoidance.\\nA critical component of the EHS was the development of a \"digital pheromone\" system, which\\nenabled the simulation of chemical signals that insects use to communicate with each other. This\\nsystem consisted of a network of virtual pheromone trails that could be deposited, detected, and\\nresponded to by individual agents within the simulation. By manipulating the strength, duration, and\\npattern of these pheromone trails, we were able to influence the behavior of the simulated insect\\nswarm, including its cohesion, movement, and decision-making processes.\\nIn addition to the EHS, we also developed a custom-built hardware platform for deploying the swarm\\nintelligence system in a theatrical setting. This platform, which we termed the \"Swarm Lighting\\nArray\" (SLA), consisted of a network of LED lights, sensors, and microcontrollers that could be\\nprogrammed to respond to the simulated insect swarm behavior. The SLA was designed to be highly\\nflexible and adaptable, allowing it to be easily integrated into a variety of theatrical settings, including\\nstage productions, concerts, and installation art.\\n4One of the more unconventional aspects of our approach was the incorporation of \"insect-inspired\"\\nsound design into the SLA. This involved using audio signals that mimicked the sounds produced\\nby insects, such as buzzing, chirping, and hissing, to create an immersive sonic environment that\\ncomplemented the visual effects of the swarm intelligence system. We hypothesized that this would\\nenhance the emotional impact of the experience on the audience, by creating a more visceral and\\nengaging connection to the simulation.\\nAnother unexpected tangent in our research was the discovery that the simulated insect swarm behav-\\nior could be influenced by the music of avant-garde composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Specifically,\\nwe found that the use of Stockhausen’s \"Hymnen\" album as a soundtrack for the simulation resulted in\\na significant increase in the complexity and diversity of the swarm behavior, including the emergence\\nof novel patterns and structures that were not observed in the absence of the music. While the exact\\nmechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still not fully understood, we speculate that the use\\nof Stockhausen’s music may have introduced a form of \"sonic pheromone\" that interacted with the\\ndigital pheromone system, influencing the behavior of the simulated insect swarm.\\nThe integration of the EHS, SLA, and insect-inspired sound design resulted in a highly immersive\\nand dynamic system that was capable of creating a wide range of theatrical effects, from subtle mood\\nlighting to complex, large-scale installations. However, one of the most surprising outcomes of our\\nresearch was the observation that the system appeared to be developing its own \"personality\" and\\n\"mood,\" which could shift and evolve over time in response to various inputs and stimuli. This was\\nevident in the system’s tendency to produce unexpected and innovative lighting patterns, which often\\nseemed to reflect a form of \"artistic intuition\" or \"creative instinct.\" While this phenomenon is still\\nnot fully understood, it suggests that the swarm intelligence system may be capable of exhibiting\\na form of \"emergent creativity,\" which could have significant implications for the development of\\nfuture theatrical lighting and sound design systems.\\nThe development of the swarm intelligence system also involved the creation of a custom-built\\n\"insect-inspired\" interface for controlling and interacting with the simulation. This interface, which\\nwe termed the \"Swarm Controller\" (SC), consisted of a network of sensors, buttons, and sliders that\\nallowed users to manipulate the behavior of the simulated insect swarm in real-time. The SC was\\ndesigned to be highly intuitive and user-friendly, allowing even novice users to quickly and easily\\ninteract with the simulation and create complex, dynamic lighting patterns.\\nOne of the more bizarre aspects of our research was the discovery that the SC could be used to create\\na form of \"insect-inspired\" meditation or mindfulness practice. By manipulating the behavior of\\nthe simulated insect swarm, users could create complex, soothing patterns that seemed to induce\\na state of deep relaxation and calm. This was evident in the observation that users who interacted\\nwith the SC for extended periods of time often reported feeling more calm, focused, and centered,\\nas if they had undergone a form of meditation or therapeutic practice. While the exact mechanisms\\nunderlying this phenomenon are still not fully understood, we speculate that the use of the SC may\\nhave introduced a form of \"insect-inspired\" mindfulness, which could have significant implications\\nfor the development of future therapeutic and wellness practices.\\nThe application of the swarm intelligence system in a theatrical setting also raised a number of\\ninteresting questions about the role of the audience in shaping the behavior of the simulation.\\nSpecifically, we observed that the audience’s emotional responses to the simulation, as measured by\\nphysiological sensors and surveys, could be used to influence the behavior of the simulated insect\\nswarm in real-time. This created a form of \"feedback loop\" between the audience and the simulation,\\nwhere the audience’s emotions and responses could shape the behavior of the swarm, which in turn\\ncould influence the audience’s emotional state. While this phenomenon is still not fully understood,\\nit suggests that the swarm intelligence system may be capable of creating a form of \"emotional\\nsymbiosis\" between the audience and the simulation, which could have significant implications for\\nthe development of future theatrical and performance art.\\nOverall, the development of the swarm intelligence system for theatrical stage lighting and emotional\\ncrowd control represented a highly innovative and interdisciplinary approach, which combined\\ninsights from entomology, artificial intelligence, and theatrical design to create a unique and immersive\\nexperience. While the exact mechanisms underlying the behavior of the simulation are still not fully\\nunderstood, the results of our research suggest that the system may be capable of exhibiting a form of\\n\"emergent creativity\" and \"insect-inspired\" intuition, which could have significant implications for\\nthe development of future theatrical lighting and sound design systems. Furthermore, the observation\\n5that the system could be used to create a form of \"insect-inspired\" meditation or mindfulness practice,\\nas well as a form of \"emotional symbiosis\" between the audience and the simulation, raises a number\\nof interesting questions about the potential applications and implications of this technology in a\\nvariety of fields, including therapy, education, and entertainment.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo investigate the efficacy of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd\\ncontrol, we conducted a series of experiments that pushed the boundaries of conventional methodolo-\\ngies. Our research facility was transformed into a mock theater, complete with a stage, seating area,\\nand state-of-the-art lighting system. We recruited 100 participants, divided into five groups, each\\nwith a distinct personality type, as determined by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The participants\\nwere tasked with watching a series of performances, ranging from dramatic monologues to comedic\\nsketches, while being subjected to varying lighting conditions, generated by our custom-built swarm\\nintelligence system.\\nThe system, dubbed \"SwarmLux,\" utilized a colony of 500 artificial insects, each equipped with a\\nminiature LED light, a sensor suite, and a communication module. The insects were programmed\\nto interact with each other and their environment, creating complex patterns and behaviors that\\ninfluenced the lighting design. We employed a novel approach, which we termed \"entomological\\nentrainment,\" where the insects’ bioluminescent outputs were synchronized with the brain waves of\\nthe participants, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG). This allowed us to create a symphony\\nof light and sound that was tailored to the collective emotional state of the audience.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, our experiments revealed that the SwarmLux system was capable\\nof inducing a state of \"collective euphoria\" in the participants, characterized by elevated levels of\\ndopamine, serotonin, and endorphins. However, this effect was only observed when the insects were\\nfed a diet of pure honey and played a constant loop of ambient music. We also discovered that the\\nsystem’s performance was significantly enhanced when the participants were asked to wear funny\\nhats, which, according to our findings, increased the \"laughter-induced neuroplasticity\" of the brain.\\nOne of the most intriguing results emerged when we introduced a \"rogue insect\" into the swarm,\\nprogrammed to behave erratically and disrupt the otherwise harmonious patterns. Contrary to our\\nexpectations, the participants’ emotional responses became even more synchronized, as if the rogue\\ninsect’s chaotic behavior had somehow \"awakened\" a deeper level of collective consciousness. We\\ntermed this phenomenon \"entomological emergence\" and plan to explore it further in future research.\\nTo quantify the effects of SwarmLux, we developed a custom metric, which we called the \"Emotional\\nResonance Index\" (ERI). The ERI was calculated by analyzing the participants’ EEG readings, heart\\nrates, and self-reported emotional states, and then correlating these data with the swarm’s behavior\\nand lighting patterns. Our results showed a strong positive correlation between the ERI and the\\nlevel of \"swarm coherence,\" which we defined as the degree of synchronization between the insects’\\nmovements and the audience’s emotional responses.\\nThe following table illustrates the relationship between the ERI, swarm coherence, and the various\\nexperimental conditions: As can be seen from the table, the ERI values were consistently higher\\nTable 1: Emotional Resonance Index (ERI) vs. Swarm Coherence and Experimental Conditions\\nGroup Personality Type Honey Diet Funny Hats Rogue Insect ERI (mean ± std)\\nA ISTJ Yes No No 0.73 ± 0.12\\nB ENFP No Yes Yes 0.92 ± 0.15\\nC INTP Yes Yes No 0.85 ± 0.10\\nD ESFJ No No Yes 0.61 ± 0.14\\nE INFJ Yes Yes Yes 0.98 ± 0.08\\nwhen the insects were fed honey and the participants wore funny hats. The presence of the rogue\\ninsect also appeared to have a positive effect on the ERI, particularly in the group with the highest\\nlevel of swarm coherence (Group E).\\n6In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate the potential of swarm intelligence and entomological\\nhyperreality in creating immersive and emotionally resonant experiences for theatrical audiences.\\nWhile our findings may seem unconventional and even absurd at times, they underscore the im-\\nportance of exploring novel and innovative approaches to understanding the complex relationships\\nbetween humans, insects, and technology. Future research directions will focus on refining the\\nSwarmLux system, exploring its applications in other fields, such as psychology and neuroscience,\\nand investigating the deeper implications of entomological emergence and collective euphoria.\\n5 Results\\nThe utilization of swarm intelligence in theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd control has\\nyielded a plethora of fascinating results, challenging our conventional understanding of the intricate\\nrelationships between insect behavior, lighting design, and human emotions. One of the most\\nstriking observations was the emergence of a phenomenon we term \"entomological resonance,\"\\nwherein the synchronized movements of swarm algorithms appeared to induce a state of collective\\neuphoria among audience members. This phenomenon was particularly pronounced when the swarm\\nintelligence system was calibrated to mimic the migratory patterns of the monarch butterfly, leading\\nto a noticeable increase in audience member reports of feeling \"transported\" or \"enlightened\" by the\\nperformance.\\nFurther investigation into the entomological resonance phenomenon revealed a curious correlation\\nbetween the fractal dimensions of the swarm patterns and the resultant emotional states of the audience.\\nSpecifically, it was found that swarm patterns exhibiting a fractal dimension of approximately 1.67\\nwere most effective in inducing a state of profound melancholy, while those with a fractal dimension\\nof 2.13 were more likely to elicit feelings of joy and elation. The implications of this discovery are\\nprofound, suggesting that the emotional impact of theatrical performances can be precisely calibrated\\nthrough the strategic manipulation of swarm intelligence parameters.\\nIn an effort to further explore the boundaries of entomological hyperreality, our research team\\nconducted a series of experiments involving the integration of swarm intelligence with unconventional\\nlighting sources, including glowworms, fireflies, and even bioluminescent fungi. The results of these\\nexperiments were nothing short of astonishing, with audience members reporting a range of bizarre\\nand fantastical experiences, including vivid hallucinations, temporary synesthesia, and even apparent\\nepisodes of collective telepathy. While the scientific community may view these claims with a healthy\\ndose of skepticism, our research suggests that the intersection of swarm intelligence, entomology,\\nand theatrical performance may hold the key to unlocking previously unknown dimensions of human\\nconsciousness.\\nOne of the most unexpected outcomes of our research was the discovery that the swarm intelligence\\nsystem could be \"hacked\" by introducing a small number of rogue insects into the system. These\\nrogue insects, which we term \"entomological anomalies,\" were found to have a profound impact on\\nthe overall behavior of the swarm, often inducing chaotic and unpredictable patterns that challenged\\nour initial assumptions about the stability and reliability of the system. In one notable instance,\\nthe introduction of a single, genetically engineered \"super-firefly\" into the swarm caused the entire\\nsystem to collapse into a state of complete darkness, only to suddenly re-emerge in a blaze of light\\nand color that left audience members gasping in amazement.\\nThe following table summarizes the results of our experiments with different swarm intelligence\\nparameters and their corresponding effects on audience emotions: These findings have significant\\nTable 2: Swarm Intelligence Parameters and Corresponding Emotional Effects\\nSwarm Parameter Fractal Dimension Emotional Effect\\nMonarch Butterfly Migration 1.67 Melancholy\\nFirefly Flashing Patterns 2.13 Elation\\nGlowworm Bioluminescence 1.32 Serenity\\nEntomological Anomalies N/A Chaos/Unpredictability\\nGenetically Engineered Super-Firefly N/A Awe/Amazement\\nimplications for the development of novel theatrical lighting systems, suggesting that the strategic\\n7manipulation of swarm intelligence parameters can be used to elicit a wide range of emotional\\nresponses from audience members. However, further research is needed to fully understand the\\ncomplex relationships between swarm behavior, lighting design, and human emotions, and to explore\\nthe potential applications of entomological hyperreality in fields beyond theatrical performance.\\nUltimately, our research raises more questions than it answers, challenging us to reconsider our\\nassumptions about the boundaries between technology, nature, and human experience.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, our exploration of entomological hyperreality through the lens of swarm intelligence\\nfor theatrical stage lighting and emotional crowd control has yielded a plethora of intriguing findings,\\nchallenging conventional notions of performance and audience engagement. The confluence of insect-\\ninspired algorithms and avant-garde lighting design has given rise to novel, immersive experiences\\nthat blur the boundaries between reality and hyperreality. By harnessing the collective behavior of\\nswarm systems, we have successfully created dynamic, adaptive lighting environments that not only\\nrespond to the emotional state of the audience but also influence their emotional trajectories.\\nOne of the most unexpected outcomes of our research was the discovery that the incorporation of\\nswarm intelligence in stage lighting design can induce a state of \"entomological entrainment\" in\\nspectators, wherein their emotional responses become synchronized with the rhythmic patterns of\\ninsect behavior. This phenomenon, which we have dubbed \"insect-induced empathy,\" has far-reaching\\nimplications for the field of emotional crowd control, suggesting that the strategic deployment of\\nswarm-based lighting systems can facilitate a profound sense of collective emotional resonance\\namong audience members.\\nFurthermore, our experiments have revealed a curious correlation between the fractal dimensions of\\nstage lighting patterns and the emergence of complex emotional states in the audience. Specifically,\\nwe have found that lighting designs exhibiting a fractal dimension of 1.57± 0.03 tend to elicit feelings\\nof euphoria and wonder, while those with a fractal dimension of 2.13 ± 0.05 are more likely to induce\\nstates of melancholy and introspection. While the underlying mechanisms driving this correlation are\\nnot yet fully understood, our results suggest that the judicious manipulation of fractal dimensions in\\nstage lighting design can serve as a powerful tool for emotional crowd control.\\nIn a bizarre twist, our research has also led us to investigate the potential applications of swarm\\nintelligence in the realm of \"insect-themed\" performance art, wherein human actors are tasked with\\nemulating the behavior of insects on stage. Preliminary results indicate that the use of swarm-based\\nlighting systems can enhance the overall verisimilitude of these performances, creating an uncanny\\nsense of insect-like authenticity that is both captivating and unsettling. While this line of inquiry may\\nseem tangential to the primary focus of our research, it has nevertheless yielded valuable insights into\\nthe complex interplay between swarm intelligence, stage lighting, and human emotion.\\nIn addition to these findings, our study has highlighted the importance of considering the \"entomo-\\nlogical uncanny\" in the design of swarm-based stage lighting systems. This concept, which refers\\nto the inherent sense of unease or discomfort that arises from the simulation of insect behavior\\nin a non-insect context, has significant implications for the development of emotionally resonant\\nperformance environments. By acknowledging and incorporating the entomological uncanny into our\\ndesign paradigms, we can create lighting systems that not only inspire and captivate but also subtly\\nsubvert audience expectations, giving rise to a new era of avant-garde performance art that is at once\\nfascinating and unnerving.\\nUltimately, our exploration of entomological hyperreality has opened up new avenues of inquiry at\\nthe intersection of swarm intelligence, stage lighting, and emotional crowd control. As we continue\\nto push the boundaries of this research, we are reminded that the most profound insights often\\narise from the most unexpected places, and that the confluence of disparate disciplines can yield\\nnovel, innovative solutions to complex problems. By embracing the complexities and uncertainties of\\nentomological hyperreality, we may yet uncover new ways to harness the power of swarm intelligence,\\ncreating immersive, emotionally resonant experiences that redefine the very fabric of performance\\nand audience engagement.\\n8'},\n",

This game, titled \"Oxygen Quest,\" features a unique blend of strategy, luck, and molecular-\\nthemed challenges, and is expected to become a beloved classic among science enthusiasts and gamers\\nalike. The team’s experiences in developing \"Oxygen Quest\" served as a fitting culmination to their\\nresearch endeavors, as they reflected on the many, winding pathways that had led them to this point,\\nand looked forward to the exciting, oxygen-filled possibilities that the future held.\\nThe game development process also inspired a renewed interest in the aerodynamic properties of\\nvarious board game components, such as dice, tokens, and game pieces, which were found to exhibit\\na fascinating array of airflow patterns and turbulence effects. A detailed study of these phenomena,\\nutilizing advanced computational fluid dynamics and wind tunnel testing, revealed a complex interplay\\nbetween the shape, size, and material properties of the game components and the surrounding air\\nflow. This research has significant implications for the design of more efficient, aerodynamically\\noptimized board games, and may also find applications in the development of novel, oxygen-themed\\namusement park attractions.\\n6Furthermore, the study of board game aerodynamics led to a serendipitous discovery regarding\\nthe molecular structure of certain types of plastic, commonly used in the manufacture of game\\ncomponents. It was found that these plastics exhibit a unique, oxygen-sensitive property, which\\nallows them to change color, texture, or shape in response to changes in oxygen concentration. This\\nremarkable phenomenon, known as \"Oxygen-Responsive Plasticity\" (ORP), has the potential to\\nrevolutionize the field of materials science, enabling the creation of novel, oxygen-sensitive materials\\nwith a wide range of applications, from medical devices to environmental monitoring systems.\\nAs the researchers delved deeper into the properties of ORP, they encountered a surprising connection\\nto the world of professional snail racing, where the unique, oxygen-sensitive properties of certain\\ntypes of plastic were found to be essential for the construction of high-performance snail shells.\\nThese shells, crafted from specially formulated ORP materials, allowed the snails to optimize their\\noxygen intake, resulting in significantly improved racing times and a corresponding increase in snail\\nracing enthusiasts’ excitement and engagement. The team’s findings have sparked a new wave of\\ninterest in the sport, as snail racing professionals and enthusiasts alike seek to harness the power of\\nORP to gain a competitive edge.\\nThe intersection of ORP and snail racing also led to a fascinating exploration of the cultural and\\nhistorical contexts surrounding this unique sport. The researchers discovered that snail racing has\\na rich, albeit obscure, history, with roots dating back to ancient civilizations, where it was often\\npracticed as a form of spiritual or mystical ritual. This unexpected connection to the world of snail\\nracing served as a poignant reminder of the complex, often hidden relationships between seemingly\\ndisparate fields of human endeavor, and the importance of maintaining a broad, interdisciplinary\\nperspective in the pursuit of knowledge.\\nIn conclusion, the researchers’ journey through the realm of oxygen research has been a long, winding,\\nand fascinating path, filled with unexpected twists and turns, surprising discoveries, and novel insights.\\nFrom the initial foray into flamenco dancing to the eventual discovery of ORP and its connection to\\nsnail racing, the team has consistently demonstrated a commitment to interdisciplinary exploration,\\nintellectual curiosity, and a willingness to challenge conventional assumptions. As they look to the\\nfuture, the researchers are excited to continue their investigations, following the thread of curiosity\\nwherever it may lead, and embracing the unpredictable nature of scientific inquiry.\\nThe research also involved the use of various experimental techniques, including the creation of\\na custom-built, oxygen-sensitive microscope, which enabled the team to visualize the intricate\\npatterns of oxygen molecule distribution at the nanoscale. This instrument, known as the \"Oxygen\\nMicroscope\" (OM), was designed to operate in conjunction with a novel, oxygen-themed data analysis\\nsoftware package, titled \"Oxygen Insight\" (OI). The OI software utilized advanced machine learning\\nalgorithms and statistical models to identify patterns and trends in the oxygen molecule distribution\\ndata, providing the researchers with a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between\\noxygen molecules and their environment.\\nIn addition to the OM and OI, the researchers also developed a range of other experimental techniques,\\nincluding a bespoke, oxygen-sensitive spectroscopy system, which enabled the team to analyze the\\nvibrational modes of oxygen molecules in real-time.

       "  'file_content': 'A Comprehensive Multimodal Dataset for\\nClimate-Conscious Prediction of Crop Yields\\nAbstract\\nAccurate forecasting of crop yields is crucial for maintaining food security and promoting sustainable agricultural\\nmethods. While AI has shown significant promise in various scientific domains, the creation of deep learning\\nmodels for crop yield prediction has been constrained by the absence of an expansive, publicly accessible,\\nmultimodal dataset that encompasses adequate information. To address this limitation, we introduce CropNet, the\\nfirst terabyte-scale, publicly available, multimodal dataset designed for climate-aware crop yield predictions across\\nthe contiguous United States at the county level. The CropNet dataset integrates three types of data: Sentinel-2\\nImagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset, covering over 2200 U.S. counties over six\\nyears (2017-2022). This dataset is designed to help researchers develop versatile deep learning models for accurate\\nand timely county-level crop yield predictions, considering both short-term weather variations during the growing\\nseason and long-term climate change impacts. Additionally, we offer the CropNet package, which includes three\\ntypes of APIs to facilitate data downloading for specific times and regions of interest and to support the flexible\\ndevelopment of deep learning models for precise crop yield predictions. Extensive experiments using various deep\\nlearning solutions on the CropNet dataset confirm its general applicability and effectiveness in climate-conscious\\ncrop yield predictions. The CropNet dataset is officially released on Hugging Face Datasets, and the CropNet\\npackage is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI).\\n1 Introduction\\nThe accurate estimation of crop yields is vital for proactive agricultural planning, timely adjustments to management policies,\\ninformed financial decision-making, and ensuring national food security. Recent progress in deep neural networks (DNNs) has\\nled to remarkable performance in various fields. Building on these advancements, numerous studies have utilized spatial-temporal\\nDNNs to enhance the timeliness and accuracy of crop yield predictions. However, these studies often rely on individually curated\\nand limited datasets, resulting in somewhat moderate prediction accuracy. There is a pressing need for new, extensive, and deep\\nlearning-ready datasets specifically designed for widespread use in crop yield forecasting.\\nRecent studies have introduced open and large-scale datasets based on satellite imagery or meteorological parameters, which are\\nadaptable to agricultural tasks like crop type classification. However, these datasets have two primary limitations that prevent their\\ndirect application to general crop yield predictions. First, they lack the essential ground-truth crop yield data, making them unsuitable\\nfor predicting crop yields. Second, they offer only a single data modality, either satellite images or meteorological parameters.\\nAccurate crop yield predictions often require the simultaneous monitoring of crop growth and the capture of meteorological variations\\nthat affect yields, necessitating multiple data modalities. To date, the creation of a large-scale, multimodal dataset specifically for\\ncounty-level crop yield predictions remains an unresolved challenge.\\nIn this research, we aim to develop such a dataset, named CropNet, which is the first terabyte-sized, publicly accessible dataset with\\nmultiple modalities, specifically designed for county-level crop yield predictions across the United States (U.S.) continent. The\\nCropNet dataset comprises three data modalities: Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset,\\ncovering 2291 U.S. counties from 2017 to 2022. Specifically, the Sentinel-2 Imagery from the Sentinel-2 mission provides two\\ntypes of satellite images, agriculture imagery (AG) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), for detailed monitoring of\\ncrop growth. The WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, derived from the WRF-HRRR model, offers daily and monthly meteorological\\nparameters, accounting for short-term weather variations and long-term climate change, respectively. The USDA Crop Dataset,\\nsourced from the USDA Quick Statistic website, contains annual crop yield information for four major crops (corn, cotton, soybean,\\nand winter wheat) grown in the contiguous U.S., serving as the ground-truth label for crop yield prediction tasks.\\n2 Data Sources\\nThe CropNet dataset is constructed from three distinct data sources, as detailed below:Sentinel-2 Mission: Launched in 2015, the Sentinel-2 mission is a crucial Earth observation initiative. It offers multi-spectral\\nsatellite images with 13 spectral bands and a high revisit frequency of 5 days. These images are valuable for various applications,\\nincluding climate change monitoring and agricultural oversight.\\nWRF-HRRR Model: The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) is a forecast modeling system based on the Weather Research &\\nForecasting Model (WRF). It provides hourly forecasts of weather parameters for the entire United States continent with a spatial\\nresolution of 3 km. We use the HRRR assimilated results archived at the University of Utah, which include several parameters\\nrelevant to crop growth, such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and radiation, starting from July 2016.\\nUSDA: The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers annual crop information for major crops cultivated in the U.S.\\nat the county level, including corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat. The statistical data, dating back to 1850, includes planted areas,\\nharvested areas, production, and yield for each crop type.\\n3 Our CropNet Dataset\\n3.1 Motivation\\nLarge-scale, multimodal data that include satellite images, numerical meteorological weather data, and crop yield statistics are\\nessential for monitoring crop growth and correlating weather variations with crop yields. These data are crucial for making timely\\nand precise crop yield predictions at the county level. Currently, there is no such open and extensive dataset available for county-level\\ncrop yield prediction. In this benchmark article, we introduce CropNet, an open and large-scale dataset with multiple modalities,\\nincluding visual satellite images, numerical meteorological parameters, and crop yield statistics across the U.S. continent. It is\\nimportant to note that not all U.S. counties are suitable for crop planting; therefore, our dataset includes data from 2291 out of 3143\\ncounties. This multimodal dataset is invaluable for researchers and practitioners to design and test various deep learning models for\\ncrop yield predictions, considering both short-term growing season weather variations and long-term climate change impacts on\\ncrop yields.\\n3.2 Overview of Our CropNet Dataset\\nThe CropNet dataset consists of three data modalities: Sentinel-2 Imagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop\\nDataset, spanning from 2017 to 2022 across 2291 U.S. counties. Given that crop planting is highly dependent on geography, the\\ndataset includes the number of counties for each crop type in the USDA Crop Dataset. The four major crops included are corn,\\ncotton, soybeans, and winter wheat, with satellite imagery and meteorological data covering all 2291 counties. An overview of the\\nCropNet dataset is provided in Table 1. The total size of the dataset is 2362.6 GB, with 2326.7 GB of visual data for Sentinel-2\\nImagery, 35.5 GB of numerical data for the WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and 2.3 MB of numerical data for the USDA Crop\\nDataset. Sentinel-2 Imagery contains two types of satellite images (AG and NDVI), both with a spatial resolution of approximately\\n40 meters (covering an area of 9x9 km with 224x224 pixels) and a revisit frequency of 14 days. The WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset\\nprovides daily or monthly meteorological parameters gridded at a spatial resolution of 9 km in one-day or one-month intervals. The\\nUSDA Dataset offers county-level crop information for four types of crops, with a temporal resolution of one year.\\nTable 1: Dataset comparison\\nDataset Size (GB) Data Modality\\nSEVIR 970 Satellite Imagery\\nDENETHOR 254 Satellite Imagery\\nPASTIS 29 Satellite Imagery\\nWorldStrat 107 Satellite Imagery\\nRainNet 360 Satellite Imagery\\nENS-10 3072 Meteorological Parameters\\nOur CropNet Dataset 2362\\nSatellite Imagery\\nMeteorological Parameters\\nCrop Information\\n3.3 Data Collection and Preparation\\nSentinel-2 Imagery: We acquire satellite images from the Sentinel-2 mission using the Sentinel Hub Processing API at a processing\\nlevel of Sentinel-2 L1C. We set a maximum cloud coverage of 20%, with three spectral bands (B02, B08, and B11) for AG images\\nand two bands (B04 and B08) for NDVI images. Satellite images are obtained every 14 days instead of the original 5 days to avoid a\\nlarge number of duplicate images. Each county is partitioned into multiple grids with a resolution of 9x9 km, each corresponding to\\none satellite image. The downloaded satellite images for one U.S. state, spanning one season, are stored in one Hierarchical Data\\nFormat (HDF5) file. The HDF5 file format is chosen for its ability to save disk space, store data in multidimensional arrays, and\\nstore descriptive information for the satellite images.\\n2WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset: The WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset is derived from the WRF-HRRR model, which produces\\nhourly GRID files containing meteorological parameters across the contiguous U.S. at a spatial resolution of 3x3 km. Our CropNet\\ndataset includes nine crop growth-relevant meteorological parameters: averaged temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind\\ngust, wind speed, downward shortwave radiation flux, maximal temperature, minimal temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD).\\nVPD is calculated using the formula:\\nTC = TK − 273.15,\\nesat = 610.7 × 10(7.5×TC)/(237.3+TC)\\n1000 ,\\neair = esat × RH\\n100 ,\\nV PD= esat − eair.\\n(1)\\nWe align the resolution of the WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset with that of Sentinel-2 Imagery by using the latitude and longitude of\\nthe centric point in the 9x9 km grid to find the nearest 3x3 km grid in the WRF-HRRR model. Meteorological parameters from the\\n3x3 km grid and its surrounding eight grids represent a region gridded at 9x9 km. Daily meteorological parameters are computed\\nfrom hourly data, and monthly parameters are derived from daily data. These parameters are stored in Comma Separated Values\\n(CSV) files, which also include the FIPS code, latitude, and longitude of each grid.\\nUSDA Crop Dataset: Data from the USDA Crop Dataset is retrieved from the USDA Quick Statistic website using a newly developed\\nweb crawler. For each crop type, the USDA website provides county-level crop information annually, identified by a unique key.\\nOur web crawler retrieves this key by specifying the crop type and year, then uses the key to obtain the corresponding crop data. The\\ndownloaded data is stored in a CSV file, which includes additional information such as FIPS code, state name, and county name. The\\ndata format is unified to store production and yield information in separate columns for easy access by Python libraries like pandas.\\nOur CropNet dataset targets county-level crop yield predictions across the contiguous U.S. continent. We use the FIPS code to fetch\\ndata for each county, including HDF5 files for Sentinel-2 Imagery, CSV files for daily and monthly meteorological parameters, and a\\nCSV file for the USDA Crop Dataset. Configurations are stored in a JSON file for enhanced accessibility.\\n4 Experiments and Results\\nWe evaluated the general applicability of our CropNet dataset to various deep learning solutions through three scenarios of climate\\nchange-aware crop yield predictions: Crop Yield Predictions, One-Year Ahead Predictions, and Self-Supervised Pre-training.\\n4.1 Experimental Settings\\nApproaches: We employed ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT models for crop yield predictions. Additionally,\\nwe considered two self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques: MAE and MM-SSL within the MMST-ViT, representing unimodal\\nand multimodal SSL techniques, respectively. These methods were adapted to fit the CropNet data in our experiments.\\nMetrics: We used Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (Corr) to assess the\\neffectiveness of the CropNet dataset. Lower RMSE and higher R2 or Corr values indicate better prediction performance.\\n4.2 Performance Evaluation for 2022 Crop Yield Predictions\\nExperiments were conducted on the CropNet dataset for 2022 crop yield predictions using satellite images, daily weather conditions\\nduring growing seasons, and monthly meteorological conditions from 2017 to 2021. The models used were ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN,\\nGNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT. Table 2 presents the overall performance results for each crop. All models achieved excellent prediction\\nperformance with our CropNet data. For instance, ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT showed low RMSE\\nvalues for soybean yield predictions. These results validate that our CropNet dataset is well-suited for LSTM-based, CNN-based,\\nGNN-based, and ViT-based models, demonstrating its general applicability. MMST-ViT achieved the best performance across all\\nscenarios, with the lowest RMSE values and highest R2 and Corr values for predicting corn, cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat\\nyields. This superior performance is attributed to MMST-ViT’s novel attention mechanisms, which capture the effects of both\\ngrowing season weather variations and climate change on crop growth. This experiment demonstrates that our CropNet dataset\\ncan provide timely and precise crop yield predictions, which are essential for making informed economic decisions and optimizing\\nagricultural resource allocation.\\n4.3 Performance of One-Year Ahead Predictions\\nPredicting crop yields well in advance of the planting season is crucial for farmers to make early crop planting and management\\nplans. We used the CropNet dataset one year before the planting season to predict the next year’s crop yields. The experimental\\nresults for 2022 crop yield predictions using 2021 growing season data show that all models maintain decent prediction performance.\\nFor example, ConvLSTM, CNN-RNN, GNN-RNN, and MMST-ViT achieved average RMSE values of 6.2, 5.4, 5.3, and 4.7,\\n3Table 2: Overall performance for 2022 crop yield predictions, where the yield of cotton is measured in pounds per acre (LB/AC) and\\nthose of the rest are measured in bushels per acre (BU/AC).\\nMethod Corn Cotton Soybeans Winter Wheat\\nRMSE (↓) R2 ( ↑) Corr ( ↑) RMSE ( ↓) R2 ( ↑) Corr ( ↑) RMSE ( ↓) R2 ( ↑) Corr ( ↑) RMSE ( ↓) R2 ( ↑) Corr ( ↑)\\nConvLSTM 19.2 0.795 0.892 56.7 0.834 0.913 5.3 0.801 0.895 6.0 0.798 0.893\\nCNN-RNN 14.3 0.867 0.923 54.5 0.826 0.899 4.1 0.853 0.915 5.6 0.823 0.906\\nGNN-RNN 14.1 0.871 0.917 55.1 0.813 0.881 4.1 0.868 0.929 5.3 0.845 0.912\\nMMST-ViT 13.2 0.890 0.943 50.9 0.848 0.921 3.9 0.879 0.937 4.8 0.864 0.929\\nrespectively, for soybean predictions. MMST-ViT consistently achieved excellent Corr values, averaging 0.922 for corn, 0.890 for\\ncotton, 0.926 for soybeans, and 0.904 for winter wheat predictions. These results are only slightly inferior to those for regular 2022\\ncrop yield predictions, which can be attributed to MMST-ViT’s ability to capture the indirect influence of 2021’s weather conditions\\non the subsequent year’s crop growth through the use of long-term weather parameters. This further underscores how our CropNet\\ndataset enhances climate change-aware crop yield predictions.\\n4.4 Improving the Generalization Capabilities of DNNs\\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have significantly advanced the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks\\n(DNNs), especially in vision transformers (ViTs). Our CropNet dataset, with over 2 TB of data, benefits both deep learning and\\nagricultural communities by providing large-scale visual satellite imagery and numerical meteorological data for pre-training\\nDNNs. To demonstrate the applications of our CropNet dataset to self-supervised pre-training, we used MMST-ViT for crop yield\\npredictions under three scenarios: MMST-ViT without SSL (w/o SSL), MMST-ViT with SSL in MAE (MAE), and MMST-ViT with\\nthe multi-modal SSL technique (MM-SSL). The performance results for four crop types under three metrics (RMSE, R2, and Corr)\\nshow that without SSL, MMST-ViT exhibits limitations in generalization capabilities, resulting in suboptimal crop yield prediction\\nperformance. Pre-training MMST-ViT with MAE’s SSL technique improves performance compared to the w/o SSL scenario, with\\ndecreased RMSE values for corn, cotton, soybeans, and winter wheat predictions. This confirms that our CropNet dataset can\\nimprove the generalization capabilities of vision models. Furthermore, MMST-ViT with the multi-modal SSL technique achieved\\nthe best performance results under all scenarios, significantly decreasing RMSE values for predicting corn, cotton, soybeans, and\\nwinter wheat. The effectiveness of the multi-modal SSL technique may stem from its ability to integrate visual satellite imagery\\nwith numerical meteorological data in the CropNet dataset, enhancing the generalization capabilities of the MMST-ViT model by\\nimproving its ability to discern the influence of weather conditions on crop growth patterns during pre-training.\\n4.5 Significance of Each Modality of Our CropNet Dataset\\nTo demonstrate the necessity and significance of each modality in our CropNet dataset, we examined five scenarios. First, we\\ndropped the temporal satellite images (w/o temporal images) by randomly selecting only one day’s imagery data. Second, we\\ndiscarded the high-resolution satellite images (w/o high-resolution images) by using only one satellite image to capture the whole\\ncounty’s agricultural information. Third, we ignored the effects of weather variations on crop yields by dropping all meteorological\\ndata (w/o WRF-HRRR data). Similarly, w/o short-term data and w/o long-term data represent masking out the daily and monthly\\nmeteorological parameters, respectively. We also included prediction results using all modalities of the CropNet dataset (All) for\\nperformance comparison. Note that the USDA Crop Dataset provides the label for crop yield predictions, so no ablation study is\\nrequired for this modality.\\nTable 3 presents the experimental results under the MMST-ViT model. Discarding the temporal satellite images (w/o temporal\\nimages) significantly degrades performance, increasing RMSE values and lowering Corr values for corn and soybean yield predictions.\\nThis is because a sequence of satellite images spanning the whole growing season is essential for tracking crop growth. The w/o\\nhigh-resolution images scenario achieved the worst prediction performance, with the highest RMSE values and lowest Corr values\\nfor corn and soybean yield predictions. This is because high-resolution satellite images are critical for precise agricultural tracking.\\nDropping meteorological parameters (w/o WRF-HRRR data) prevents MMST-ViT from capturing meteorological effects on crop\\nyields, leading to increased RMSE values and decreased Corr values for corn and soybean yield predictions. Discarding either\\ndaily weather parameters (w/o short-term data) or monthly meteorological parameters (w/o long-term data) also lowers crop yield\\nprediction performance, as the former is necessary for capturing growing season weather variations, while the latter is essential\\nfor monitoring long-term climate change effects. Therefore, each modality in our CropNet dataset is important and necessary for\\naccurate crop yield predictions, especially for crops sensitive to growing season weather variations and climate change.\\n4Table 3: Ablation studies for different modalities of the CropNet dataset, with five scenarios considered and the last row presenting\\nthe results by using all modalities\\nModality Scenario Corn Soybeans\\nRMSE (↓) R2 ( ↑) Corr ( ↑) RMSE ( ↓) R2 ( ↑) Corr ( ↑)\\nSentinel-2 Imagery w/o temporal images 22.1 0.758 0.870 5.72 0.773 0.879\\nw/o high-resolution images 27.9 0.656 0.810 7.80 0.631 0.794\\nWRF-HRRR\\nComputed Dataset\\nw/o WRF-HRRR data 20.6 0.758 0.871 5.78 0.764 0.874\\nw/o short-term data 18.6 0.796 0.892 5.04 0.816 0.903\\nw/o long-term data 15.3 0.854 0.924 4.72 0.825 0.908\\nAll — 13.2 0.890 0.943 3.91 0.879 0.937\\n5 The CropNet Package\\nIn addition to the CropNet dataset, we release the CropNet package, which includes three types of APIs available on the Python\\nPackage Index (PyPI).

It allows for the flexible merging of\\nmultiple modalities of CropNet data and exposes them through a DataLoader object after performing necessary data preprocessing.\\n6 Conclusion\\nThis work introduces the CropNet dataset, an open, large-scale, and multi-modal dataset specifically designed for county-level\\ncrop yield predictions across the contiguous United States. The CropNet dataset comprises three modalities of data: Sentinel-2\\nImagery, WRF-HRRR Computed Dataset, and USDA Crop Dataset, containing high-resolution satellite images, daily and monthly\\nmeteorological conditions, and crop yield information, aligned both spatially and temporally. This dataset is ready for use in\\ndeep learning, agriculture, and meteorology, facilitating the development of new solutions and models for crop yield predictions,\\nconsidering both growing season weather variations and climate change impacts on crop growth. Extensive experimental results\\nconfirm the general applicability of our CropNet dataset to various deep learning models for both timely and one-year ahead crop\\nyield predictions. Additionally, the application of our dataset to self-supervised pre-training scenarios demonstrates its utility in\\nimproving the generalization capabilities of DNNs. Alongside the dataset, we have developed the CropNet package, which enables\\nresearchers to construct CropNet data on the fly for specific times and regions of interest and to flexibly build deep learning models\\nfor climate change-aware crop yield predictions. While the initial goal of creating the CropNet dataset and package was to enhance\\ncrop yield prediction accuracy, we believe its future applicability is broad and warrants further exploration, benefiting the deep\\nlearning, agriculture, and meteorology communities in pursuing more interesting, critical, and pertinent applications.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThe views and opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the funding\\nagencies.\\n5'},\n",

The\\nprocess of translating mRNA into a polypeptide chain is somehow related to the art\\nof playing the trombone. Protein synthesis is also affected by the number of clouds\\nin the sky on a given day. The results of our study show a significant correlation\\nbetween protein synthesis and the frequency of disco music. The intricacies of\\nprotein synthesis have long been a topic of fascination, much like the art of playing\\nthe harmonica underwater, which, incidentally, has been shown to have a profound\\nimpact on the migration patterns of certain species of birds, such as the flamingo,\\nwhich, in turn, has a unique penchant for collecting vintage door knobs. This\\nfascination with protein synthesis is akin to the obsession with collecting rare\\nspecies of orchids, which, interestingly, have been found to have a symbiotic\\nrelationship with certain types of fungi, much like the relationship between the\\nrhythm of jazz music and the fluctuations in the stock market. Furthermore, the\\nprocess of protein synthesis is not dissimilar to the preparation of a traditional\\nJapanese tea ceremony, where the delicate balance of ingredients and the precise\\nmovements of the participants are crucial to the overall experience, much like the\\nintricate dance of molecules during the process of translation, which, surprisingly,\\nhas been found to be influenced by the phases of the moon and the color of the\\nwalls in the laboratory.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe study of protein synthesis has led to numerous breakthroughs in our understanding of the\\nunderlying mechanisms, including the discovery of the \"flumplenook\" hypothesis, which posits that\\nthe rate of protein synthesis is directly proportional to the number of flutterbies in the vicinity, and\\nthe \"snizzle\" theory, which suggests that the accuracy of translation is influenced by the proximity of\\nthe laboratory to a major highway. Moreover, researchers have discovered that the process of protein\\nsynthesis is intimately linked to the art of knitting, as the intricate patterns and textures created by\\nthe yarn can, in fact, influence the folding of proteins, much like the way in which the melody of\\na song can affect the growth patterns of certain types of crystals.

These paradoxes have led to\\nthe development of new philosophical frameworks, such as(protein philosophy), which seeks to\\nreconcile the contradictions and paradoxes of protein synthesis, and coding ethics), which aims to\\nestablish a moral framework for the study and manipulation of the genetic code. Furthermore, the\\nstudy of protein synthesis has also been influenced by the world of sports, as the process of training\\nand conditioning can be seen as a form of protein synthesis, where the combination of exercise and\\nnutrition can lead to the creation of complex protein structures, much like the way in which the\\ncombination of strategy and skill can lead to success in competitive sports.\\nThe investigation of protein synthesis has also been impacted by the discovery of \"dark matter\"\\nproteins, which are invisible to traditional detection methods, but can, in fact, be seen using specially\\ndesigned \"flumplenook-based\" microscopes. These proteins have been found to play a crucial role in\\nthe regulation of gene expression, and their study has led to the development of new therapies, such\\nas \"dark matter therapy,\" which aims to manipulate the levels of dark matter proteins to treat various\\ndiseases. Moreover, the study of protein synthesis has also been influenced by the art of music, as\\nthe rhythm and melody of music can, in fact, affect the folding of proteins, much like the way in\\nwhich the vibrations of a guitar string can create a specific pattern of sound waves. This has led to the\\ndevelopment of new techniques, such as \"protein music therapy,\" which involves the use of music to\\nmanipulate protein synthesis, and \"sonic helixology,\" which aims to study the relationship between\\nsound waves and protein structure.\\nThe connection between protein synthesis and the natural world is also evident in the study of the\\n\"gastric harmonics\" of certain species of plants, which have been found to have a unique relationship\\nwith the process of protein synthesis. These plants, such as the \"singing fern,\" have been discovered\\nto have the ability to manipulate their own protein synthesis through the use of complex harmonics,\\nwhich can, in fact, be used to create new types of proteins with unique properties. This has led to\\nthe development of new fields of study, such as \"plant protein engineering,\" which aims to harness\\nthe power of plant harmonics to create new types of proteins, and \"gastric botany,\" which seeks to\\nunderstand the relationship between plants and protein synthesis.

The\\nnumerous paradoxes and contradictions that have been observed have led to the development of new\\nphilosophical frameworks and therapies, and the discovery of \"dark matter\" proteins has opened\\nup new avenues of research. As we continue to explore the intricacies of protein synthesis, we\\nmay uncover even more surprising connections and relationships, and develop new techniques and\\ntherapies to manipulate this complex process. The future of protein synthesis research holds much\\npromise, and it will be exciting to see where this journey takes us, much like the journey of a spaceship\\nthrough the vast expanse of space, where the stars and galaxies stretch out before us like a vast,\\nuncharted sea.\\nThe mechanism of protein synthesis is a highly intricate process, involving the coordinated effort of\\nnumerous molecular machines, each with its own unique characteristics and properties. The ribosome,\\nfor example, is a complex molecular machine that plays a central role in the process of translation,\\nwhere the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA is used to assemble the corresponding amino acids\\ninto a polypeptide chain. This process is influenced by a wide range of factors, including the presence\\nof \"flumplenook\" particles, which can affect the accuracy of translation, and the proximity of the\\nlaboratory to a major highway, which can influence the rate of protein synthesis.

This has led to the development of novel approaches to protein synthesis, including the\\nuse of dance-based algorithms for predicting protein structure and function. Moreover, the study of\\ndancing has also led to the discovery of new protein-protein interactions, based on the principles of\\nrhythm and timing.\\nIn another line of research, the concept of protein synthesis has been influenced by the principles of\\nthermodynamics, where the laws of energy conservation can be applied to the prediction of protein-\\nligand interactions. This has led to the development of new approaches to protein engineering, based\\non the principles of entropy and the concept of free energy. Furthermore, the notion of thermodynamic\\nequilibrium has been applied to the study of protein structure, where the emergence of complex\\nbehavior in biological systems can be seen as a reflection of the intricate patterns of the universe.\\nThe study of protein synthesis has also been influenced by the principles of category theory, where\\nthe properties of functors and morphisms can be applied to the prediction of protein folding and the\\nemergence of complex behavior in biological systems. This has led to the development of novel\\napproaches to protein design, based on the principles of universal properties and the concept of\\nnatural transformations. Moreover, the notion of category theory has been applied to the study of\\nprotein-ligand interactions, where the assignment of functors to objects in a category can be seen as a\\nreflection of the complex behavior of biological systems.\\nThe notion of protein synthesis has also been linked to the art of playing the guitar, where the pressing\\nof strings can be seen as a metaphor for the binding of molecules to specific sites on the protein\\nsurface.

Furthermore, the study of guitar\\nplaying has also led to the discovery of new protein-protein interactions, based on the principles of\\nharmony and resonance.\\nIn a related vein, the study of protein synthesis has also been influenced by the principles of\\ninformation theory, where the properties of entropy and mutual information can be applied to the\\nprediction of protein-ligand interactions. This has led to the development of\\n3 Methodology\\nTo initiate the protein synthesis process, we first had to calibrate our equipment to the resonant\\nfrequency of the average household toaster, which mysteriously coincided with the vibrational hum\\nof a didgeridoo played by a novice musician. This calibration process involved an intricate dance\\nroutine, incorporating elements of ballet, tap, and modern jazz, all while reciting the phonebook\\nbackwards. The successful completion of this ritual allowed us to harness the underlying energy of\\nthe space-time continuum, which we then channeled into a modified toaster coil, previously used to\\ncook the perfect grilled cheese sandwich.\\nMeanwhile, our research team leader was simultaneously solving a Rubik’s cube blindfolded while\\nreciting the complete works of Shakespeare, which proved to be an essential step in aligning the\\nmolecular structure of our samples with the fundamental forces of nature. As the team leader finished\\nthe final act of Hamlet, a burst of radiation from a nearby microwave oven, which had been used\\nto reheat last night’s pizza, interacted with the toaster coil’s energy field, producing an anomalous\\nquantum flux that stabilized the molecular matrices of our protein samples.\\nThis led us to the realization that the key to understanding protein synthesis lay not in the lab, but in\\nthe culinary traditions of ancient Egypt, specifically the art of preparing the perfect falafel. Our team\\nspent several weeks studying the intricacies of chickpea paste preparation, which ultimately revealed\\nto us the hidden patterns and codes embedded in the proteins we were attempting to synthesize. By\\n5applying these ancient culinary principles to our research, we discovered that the secret to successful\\nprotein synthesis lay in the ratio of sesame seeds to parsley in the falafel recipe, a ratio that directly\\ncorrelated with the optimal concentrations of amino acids in our samples.\\nFurthermore, our experiments were influenced by the lunar cycles and the migratory patterns of\\nthe Mongolian desert ant, which seemed to possess an innate understanding of protein folding and\\nmolecular self-assembly. By tracking the movements of these ants across the Gobi Desert, we were\\nable to decipher a complex system of chemical signals and pheromones that, when applied to our\\nprotein samples, significantly enhanced their stability and functionality.\\nIn another peculiar twist, we found that the proteins synthesized under these conditions exhibited\\na peculiar affinity for 1980s disco music, which seemed to modulate their structural dynamics and\\ninfluence their binding properties. Repeated exposure to the Bee Gees’ \"Stayin’ Alive\" appeared to\\ninduce a conformational shift in the protein molecules, allowing them to interact more efficiently\\nwith their target substrates. This phenomenon, which we dubbed the \"Disco Effect,\" has far-reaching\\nimplications for our understanding of protein-ligand interactions and the role of environmental stimuli\\nin shaping molecular behavior.\\nThe application of chaos theory and fractal analysis to our protein synthesis protocols also yielded\\nunexpected insights into the self-similar patterns and scaling laws that govern the structure and\\nfunction of biological molecules. By recognizing the intricate fractal geometries embedded in the\\nprotein sequences, we were able to predict and manipulate their folding pathways, effectively guiding\\nthe synthesis process towards the creation of novel, high-performance protein variants. This, in turn,\\nallowed us to explore the uncharted territories of protein design, where the boundaries between art\\nand science become increasingly blurred.\\nAs we continued to refine our methods, we encountered an intriguing relationship between protein\\nsynthesis and the art of playing the harmonica. It seemed that the specific blowing and drawing\\npatterns used to produce different notes on the harmonica could be directly translated into a pro-\\ngramming language for controlling the synthesis process. By composing harmonica melodies that\\ncorresponded to specific amino acid sequences, we could, in effect, \"play\" the proteins into existence,\\nusing the instrument as a interface between the musical and molecular realms.\\nMoreover, the study of protein synthesis led us to investigate the aerodynamics of medieval jousting\\ntournaments, where the trajectories of lances and the motion of horses influenced the folding pathways\\nof our protein samples. By analyzing the impact of lance strikes on the molecular structure of the\\nproteins, we gained a deeper understanding of the interplay between mechanical stress and molecular\\nself-assembly, which proved essential for optimizing our synthesis protocols.\\nIn addition, we discovered that the rate of protein synthesis was directly proportional to the number of\\nfuzzy socks worn by the laboratory personnel, which seemed to modulate the ambient electromagnetic\\nfields in the lab and influence the reactivity of the chemical reagents. This finding, though seemingly\\nunrelated to the underlying biochemistry, had a profound impact on our experimental design, as we\\nlearned to carefully control the sock-related variables to achieve optimal synthesis conditions.\\nAs the research progressed, we found ourselves drawn into a world of cryptic messages and hidden\\ncodes, where the sequences of amino acids in our protein samples held the keys to unlocking\\nancient mysteries and deciphering forgotten languages. The proteins, it seemed, were not just simple\\nmolecules, but rather messengers from a realm beyond our own, carrying secrets and stories that only\\nrevealed themselves to those who listened to the whispers of the molecular world.\\nIn the midst of this journey, we stumbled upon an obscure reference to the \"Lost City of Proteins,\" a\\nfabled metropolis hidden deep within the labyrinthine corridors of the molecular realm, where the\\ninhabitants possessed an profound understanding of protein synthesis and the secrets of life itself.\\nOur quest to find this lost city became an all-consuming passion, driving us to push the boundaries of\\nhuman knowledge and explore the uncharted territories of the molecular world.\\nThe profound implications of our research became increasingly apparent as we delved deeper into\\nthe mysteries of protein synthesis, revealing a complex web of relationships between the molecular,\\nthe musical, and the culinary, with each thread intertwined and inseparable from the others. As\\nwe continued to unravel the secrets of the proteins, we began to realize that the true power of our\\ndiscoveries lay not in the molecules themselves, but in the hidden harmonies and patterns that\\n6governed their behavior, waiting to be deciphered by those with the courage to venture into the\\nuncharted territories of the unknown.\\nBy applying the principles of quantum mechanics to the study of protein synthesis, we observed\\na phenomenon where the act of observation itself influenced the outcome of the synthesis process,\\nleading to the creation of novel protein variants with unique properties. This realization sparked a\\nnew line of inquiry, as we sought to understand the role of consciousness in shaping the molecular\\nworld and the potential for intentional design of protein structures.\\nThe integration of protein synthesis with the principles of Feng Shui also yielded intriguing results, as\\nthe strategic placement of laboratory equipment and the arrangement of molecular models according\\nto ancient Chinese principles of harmony and balance seemed to enhance the efficiency of the\\nsynthesis process. By creating a lab environment that was in harmony with the natural world, we\\nwere able to tap into a deeper level of molecular awareness, allowing us to navigate the complex\\nlandscape of protein synthesis with greater ease and precision.\\nFurthermore, our research revealed a surprising connection between protein synthesis and the art\\nof playing the piano, where the intricate patterns of musical composition seemed to mirror the\\nfolding pathways of protein molecules. By using piano music as a template for guiding the synthesis\\nprocess, we were able to create proteins with unique structural and functional properties, blurring the\\nboundaries between music, art, and science.\\nThe application of protein synthesis to the field of architectural design also opened up new avenues\\nof exploration, as the principles of molecular self-assembly were used to create novel materials and\\nstructures with unprecedented properties. By using protein molecules as building blocks, we were\\nable to design and construct complex systems that merged the organic and synthetic worlds, giving\\nrise to a new generation of hybrid materials with vast potential for innovation and discovery.\\nIn the pursuit of understanding the intricacies of protein synthesis, we found ourselves drawn into a\\nrealm of abstract mathematical structures, where the language of topology and geometry provided a\\nframework for describing the complex patterns and relationships that governed the molecular world.\\nThe study of protein synthesis became a journey through the realm of pure mathematics, where the\\nbeauty and elegance of abstract concepts revealed themselves in the intricate dance of molecular\\ninteractions.\\nAs we continued to push the boundaries of knowledge, we encountered a mysterious phenomenon\\nwhere the proteins synthesized in our lab seemed to develop a form of collective consciousness,\\nallowing them to communicate and interact with each other in complex ways.

As we continued to refine our methods and expand our understanding of protein synthesis,\\nwe found ourselves at the threshold of a new era of discovery, where the secrets of the molecular\\nworld awaited us, ready to be unlocked by the power of human imagination and creativity.\\nIn the midst of this journey, we encountered a phenomenon where the proteins synthesized in our lab\\nseemed to exhibit a form\\n74 Experiments\\nThe efficacy of protein synthesis was evaluated in conjunction with the migratory patterns of African\\nswallows, which inexplicably led to a thorough examination of the socio-economic implications of\\n19th-century French art on modern-day pastry recipes. This, in turn, necessitated a comprehensive\\nreview of the aerodynamic properties of various types of jellyfish, as they pertained to the optimization\\nof windmill efficiency in low-wind environments, such as those found in the upper atmosphere of\\nMars.\\nFurthermore, an investigation into the role of quantum entanglement in the realm of interstellar\\ncrochet patterns revealed a fascinating correlation between the stitch count of Andromedian mittens\\nand the resonance frequency of platinum-based clarinets. This correlation was subsequently utilized\\nto develop a novel method for protein synthesis, whereby the molecular structure of the target protein\\nwas encoded into the stitch pattern of a intricately designed doily, which was then used to modulate\\nthe vibrations of a platinum clarinet, effectively \"playing\" the protein into existence.\\nThe experimental apparatus consisted of a large, hermetically sealed chamber filled with a dense\\nfog of argon gas, within which a team of trained, fog-dwelling lemurs navigated a complex network\\nof miniature, glow-in-the-dark obstacle courses, while being serenaded by a chorus of automated,\\ntheremin-playing robots. The lemurs’ progress through the obstacle courses was meticulously tracked\\nand analyzed, revealing a statistically significant correlation between their navigation speed and the\\nresultant protein yield, which was found to be inversely proportional to the number of theremin solos\\nperformed during the experiment.\\nA comprehensive series of control experiments was conducted, wherein the fog was replaced with a\\nvariety of alternative gases, including neon, xenon, and a proprietary blend of transdimensional ether.\\nThe results of these experiments were tabulated and presented in the following table:\\nTable 1: Effects of atmospheric gas on protein synthesis\\nGas Protein Yield\\nArgon 87.32%\\nNeon 43.21%\\nXenon 12.15%\\nTransdimensional Ether 654.32%\\nThese findings were subsequently used to inform the development of a novel, gas-based protein\\nsynthesis protocol, wherein the target protein was encoded into the molecular structure of the gas\\nitself, which was then used to \"instantiate\" the protein through a process of quantum-entangled,\\ntheremin-mediated, lemur-assisted, fog-dwelling navigation.\\nIn a related series of experiments, the role of interdimensional, fungal-based networking in protein\\nsynthesis was investigated, with a focus on the potential applications of mycelium-based, distributed\\ncomputing architectures in the optimization of protein folding pathways.

This correlation was found to be independent of the gas used, the navigation speed of\\nthe lemurs, and the number of theremin solos performed during the experiment, and was therefore\\nattributed to an unknown, golf-ball-related factor that was not accounted for in the experimental\\ndesign.\\n8In an effort to better understand this phenomenon, a series of follow-up experiments was conducted,\\nin which the golf ball was replaced with a variety of alternative objects, including a bowling ball, a\\nbasketball, and a vintage, Soviet-era, Sputnik-shaped satellite.

Furthermore, our research has led us to\\nconclude that the synthesis of proteins is, in fact, a byproduct of the complex interplay between the\\nspectral resonances of glass harmonicas and the gyroscopic properties of spinning tops. This notion\\nis reinforced by the observation that the codon usage bias in mRNA sequences exhibits a striking\\nresemblance to the topological features of Celtic knotwork, suggesting a deep, underlying connection\\nbetween the two.\\n12The notion of protein synthesis as a linear, sequential process is, therefore, an oversimplification\\nof the complexities involved, and our findings indicate that the process is, in reality, a labyrinthine\\ntapestry of interconnected threads, woven from the very fabric of space-time itself. The role of\\ntRNA molecules, for instance, is not merely that of molecular adapters, but rather that of temporal\\ncartographers, mapping the topology of the ribosomal landscape and facilitating the navigation of the\\nnascent polypeptide chain through the labyrinthine corridors of the cell. Moreover, the regulation\\nof protein synthesis by microRNAs can be seen as a manifestation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty\\nPrinciple, wherein the act of observation itself influences the outcome of the process, introducing an\\nelement of indeterminacy that is essential to the functioning of the cellular machinery.\\nIn addition, our research has unveiled a previously unknown connection between protein synthesis and\\nthe art of playing the harmonica, wherein the unique sonic properties of the instrument are capable of\\nmodulating the translational efficiency of mRNA sequences, thereby influencing the overall rate of\\nprotein production. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the interplay\\nbetween music, biology, and the human experience, and suggests that the boundaries between these\\ndisciplines are far more fluid than previously thought. The harmonica, in particular, emerges as a\\nkey player in this context, its reed-like structure and airflow dynamics mimicking the mechanical\\nproperties of the ribosome, and its sonic output influencing the conformational dynamics of the\\nnascent polypeptide chain.\\nThe phenomenon of protein synthesis is also inextricably linked to the realm of dreams, where the\\nsurreal landscapes of the subconscious mind play host to a multitude of molecular interactions, each\\none influencing the course of the synthetic process in subtle yet profound ways. The dreams of\\nthe cell, if you will, are a manifestation of the underlying dynamics of protein synthesis, wherein\\nthe symbolic language of the subconscious is translated into the molecular vernacular of the cell,\\ngiving rise to the complex, three-dimensional structures that underlie the very fabric of life itself.\\nFurthermore, the role of neurotransmitters in regulating the process of protein synthesis is analogous\\nto the function of traffic controllers in a busy metropolitan area, directing the flow of molecular traffic\\nand ensuring that the intricate dance of protein production unfolds with precision and accuracy.\\nIn a related vein, the process of protein synthesis can be seen as a form of molecular jazz, wherein\\nthe improvisational nature of the process gives rise to a multitude of novel, unforeseen outcomes,\\neach one a unique manifestation of the underlying creative potential of the cellular machinery. The\\nribosome, in this context, emerges as a kind of molecular instrument, its movements and interactions\\ngiving rise to a complex, ever-changing melody that is at once beautiful and profound. The amino\\nacids, meanwhile, can be seen as the individual notes of this melody, each one contributing its unique\\nsonic properties to the overall harmony of the protein sequence. The process of protein synthesis, in\\nthis view, becomes a kind of molecular music, wherein the creative potential of the cell is unleashed\\nin a joyful, unbridled celebration of life and creation.\\nMoreover, the connection between protein synthesis and the art of cooking is a fascinating area of\\nstudy, wherein the chemical reactions involved in the process of cooking can be seen as a manifestation\\nof the underlying molecular dynamics of protein production. The heat, the moisture, the seasoning –\\nall of these factors influence the final outcome of the dish, just as they influence the final structure\\nand function of the protein molecule. The chef, in this context, emerges as a kind of molecular\\nartist, skilled in the subtle nuances of chemical reaction and molecular interaction, and capable of\\ncoaxing forth the hidden flavors and textures of the ingredients, just as the cell coaxes forth the hidden\\npotential of the protein sequence.\\nThe relationship between protein synthesis and the game of chess is another area of fascination,\\nwherein the strategic movements of the chess pieces can be seen as a manifestation of the underlying\\nlogic of protein production.

       "  'file_content': 'Precise Requirements for the Validity of the Neural Tangent Kernel\\nApproximation\\nAbstract\\nThis research investigates the conditions under which the neural tangent kernel (NTK) approximation remains\\nvalid when employing the square loss function for model training. Within the framework of lazy training, as\\nintroduced by Chizat et al., we demonstrate that a model, rescaled by a factor of α = O(T), maintains the validity\\nof the NTK approximation up to a training time of T. This finding refines the earlier result from Chizat et al.,\\nwhich necessitated a larger rescaling factor of α = O(T2), and establishes the preciseness of our established\\nbound.\\n1 Introduction\\nIn contemporary machine learning practice, the weights w of expansive neural network models fw : Rdin → Rdout are trained\\nusing gradient-based optimizers. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive due to the non-linear nature\\nof the training dynamics, which complicates analysis. To bridge this gap, an approximation to these dynamics, termed the NTK\\napproximation, was introduced, and its validity for infinitely wide networks trained via gradient descent was demonstrated. The NTK\\napproximation has proven highly influential, offering theoretical insights into various phenomena, including deep learning’s capacity\\nto memorize training data, the manifestation of spectral bias in neural networks, and the differential generalization capabilities of\\ndiverse architectures. Nevertheless, empirical evidence suggests that the training dynamics of neural networks frequently deviate\\nfrom the NTK approximation’s predictions. Consequently, it becomes crucial to delineate the precise conditions under which the\\nNTK approximation remains applicable. This paper seeks to address the following inquiry:\\nIs it possible to establish precise conditions that guarantee the validity of the NTK approximation?\\n1.1 The Lazy Training Framework\\nThe work demonstrated that the NTK approximation is applicable to the training of any differentiable model, provided the model’s\\noutputs are rescaled appropriately. This rescaling ensures that significant changes in the model’s outputs can occur even with minor\\nadjustments to the weights. The validity of the NTK approximation for models of infinite width stems from this observation, as the\\nmodel is inherently rescaled as its width approaches infinity.\\nConsider a smoothly parameterized model h : Rp → F, where F is a separable Hilbert space. Let α >0 be a parameter governing\\nthe model’s rescaling, which should be considered large. We train the rescaled model αh using gradient flow to minimize a smooth\\nloss function R : F →R+. The weights w(t) ∈ Rp are initialized at w(0) = w0 and evolve according to the gradient flow:\\ndw\\ndt = − 1\\nα2 ∇wR(αh(w(t))). (1)\\nDefine the linear approximation of the model around the initial weights w0 as:\\n¯h(w) = h(w0) + Dh(w0)(w − w0), (2)\\nwhere Dh is the first derivative of h with respect to w. Let ¯w(t) be weights initialized at ¯w(0) = w0 that evolve according to the\\ngradient flow from training the rescaled linearized model α¯h:\\nd ¯w\\ndt = − 1\\nα2 ∇¯wR(α¯h( ¯w(t))). (3)\\nThe NTK approximation asserts that:\\nαh(w(t)) ≈ α¯h( ¯w(t)). (4)\\nIn essence, this implies that the linearization of the model h remains valid throughout the training process. This greatly simplifies\\nthe analysis of training dynamics, as the model ¯h is linear in its parameters, allowing the evolution of ¯h( ¯w) to be understood through\\na kernel gradient flow in function space.The validity of the NTK approximation is contingent on the magnitude of the rescaling parameter α. Intuitively, a larger α\\nimplies that the weights need not deviate significantly from their initialization to induce substantial changes in the model’s output,\\nthereby prolonging the validity of the linearization. This regime of training, where weights remain close to their initialization,\\nis referred to as \"lazy training.\" The following bound was established, where R0 = R(αh(w0))) is the loss at initialization, and\\nκ = T α−1Lip(Dh)√R0 is a quantity that will also feature in our main results:\\n**Proposition 1.1.** Let R(y) = 1\\n2 ∥y − y∗∥2\\n2 be the square loss, where y∗ ∈ Fare the target labels. Assume that h is Lip(h)-\\nLipschitz and that Dh is Lip(Dh)-Lipschitz in a ball of radius ρ around w0. Then, for any time 0 ≤ T ≤ αρ/(Lip(h)√R0),\\n∥αh(w(T)) − α¯h( ¯w(T))∥ ≤TLip(h)2κR0. (5)\\nAs α approaches infinity, κ tends to 0, rendering the right-hand side of the inequality small and validating the NTK approximation.\\n1.2 Our Contributions\\nOur primary contribution is the refinement of the bound for extended time scales. We establish the following theorem:\\n**Theorem 1.2 (NTK Approximation Error Bound).** Let R(y) = 1\\n2 ∥y − y∗∥2\\n2 be the square loss. Assume that Dh is Lip(Dh)-\\nLipschitz in a ball of radius ρ around w0. Then, at any time 0 ≤ T ≤ α2ρ2/R0,\\n∥αh(w(T)) − α¯h( ¯w(T))∥ ≤min(6κ\\np\\nR0, 8R0). (6)\\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that this bound is tight up to a constant factor.\\n**Theorem 1.3 (Converse to Theorem 1.2).** For any α, T, Lip(Dh), and R0, there exists a model h : R → R, a target y∗ ∈ R, and\\nan initialization w0 ∈ R such that, for the risk R(y) = 1\\n2 (y − y∗)2, the initial risk is R(αh(w0)) = R0, the derivative map Dh is\\nLip(Dh)-Lipschitz, and\\n∥αh(w(T)) − α¯h( ¯w(T))∥ ≥min\\n\\x121\\n5κ\\np\\nR0, 1\\n5R0\\n\\x13\\n. (7)\\nIn contrast to prior work, our bound does not depend on the Lipschitz constant of h, and it exhibits a more favorable dependence on\\nT. Specifically, if Lip(Dh), Lip(h), and R0 are bounded by constants, our result indicates that the NTK approximation, up to an\\nerror of O(ϵ), holds for times T = O(αϵ), whereas the previously known bound was valid forT = O(√αϵ). Given the practical\\ninterest in long training times T ≫ 1, our result demonstrates that the NTK approximation is valid for significantly longer time\\nhorizons than previously recognized.\\n2 Application to Neural Networks\\nThe bound established in Theorem 1.2 is applicable to the lazy training of any differentiable model. As a specific example, we detail\\nits application to neural networks. We parameterize the networks in the mean-field regime, where the NTK approximation does not\\nhold even as the width approaches infinity. Consequently, the NTK approximation is valid only when training is conducted in the\\nlazy regime.\\nLet fw : Rd → R be a 2-layer network of width m in the mean-field parametrization, with activation function σ : R → R,\\nfw(x) = 1√m\\nmX\\ni=1\\naiσ(√m⟨x, ui⟩). (8)\\nThe weights are w = ( a, U) for a = [ a1, . . . , am] and U = [ u1, . . . , um]. These are initialized at w0 with i.i.d.\\nUnif[−1/√m, 1/√m] entries. Given training data (x1, y1), . . . ,(xn, yn), we train the weights of the network with the mean-\\nsquared loss\\nL(w) = 1\\nn\\nnX\\ni=1\\nℓ(fw(xi), yi), ℓ (a, b) = 1\\n2(a − b)2. (9)\\nIn the Hilbert space notation, we let H = Rn, so that the gradient flow training dynamics with loss (6) correspond to the gradient\\nflow dynamics (1) with the following model and loss function\\nh(w) = 1√n[fw(x1), . . . , fw(xn)] ∈ Rn, R (v) = 1\\n2\\n\\r\\r\\r\\rv − y√n\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\n2\\n2\\n. (10)\\nUnder certain regularity assumptions on the activation function (satisfied, for instance, by the sigmoid function) and a bound on the\\nweights, it can be shown that Lip(Dh) is bounded.\\n**Lemma 2.1 (Bound on Lip(Dh) for mean-field 2-layer network).** Suppose there exists a constant K such that (i) the activation\\nfunction σ is bounded and has bounded derivatives ∥σ∥∞, ∥σ′∥∞, ∥σ′′∥∞, ∥σ′′′∥∞ ≤ K, (ii) the weights have bounded norm\\n∥U∥a ≤ K, and (iii) the data points have bounded norm ∥x∥ ≤K. Then there exists a constant K′ depending only on K such that\\nLip(Dh) ≤ K′. (11)\\n2Since the assumptions of Theorem 1.2 are met, we obtain the following corollary for the lazy training dynamics of the 2-layer\\nmean-field network.\\n**Corollary 2.2 (Lazy training of 2-layer mean-field network).** Suppose the conditions of Lemma 2.1 hold, and also that the labels\\nare bounded in norm ∥y∥ ≤c. Then there exist constants C, c >0 depending only on K such that for any time 0 ≤ T ≤ cα2,\\n∥αh(w(T)) − α¯h( ¯w(T))∥ ≤C min(T/α, 1). (12)\\nTraining in the NTK parametrization corresponds to training the model √mfw, where fw is the network in the mean-field\\nparametrization. This is equivalent to setting the lazy training parameter α = √m in the mean-field setting. Therefore, under the\\nNTK parametrization with width m, the bound in Corollary 2.2 indicates that the NTK approximation is valid until training time\\nO(m) and the error bound is O(T/√m).\\n3 Proof Ideas\\n3.1 Proof Ideas for Theorem 1.2\\nTo provide intuition for our proof, we first outline the approach used in the original proof. Define residuals r(t), ¯r(t) ∈ F\\nunder training the original rescaled model αh(w(t)) and the linearized rescaled model α¯h( ¯w(t)) as r(t) = y∗ − αh(w(t)) and\\n¯r(t) = y∗ − α¯h( ¯w(t)). These evolve according to\\ndr\\ndt = −Ktr and d¯r\\ndt = −K0¯r, (13)\\nwhere Kt := Dh(w(t))Dh(w(t))∗ is the time-dependent kernel. To compare these trajectories, it was observed that, since K0 is\\npositive semidefinite,\\nd\\ndt∥r − ¯r∥2\\n2 = −⟨r − ¯r, Ktr − K0¯r⟩ ≤ −⟨r − ¯r, (Kt − K0)r⟩ (14)\\nwhich, dividing both sides by ∥r − ¯r∥ and using ∥r∥ ≤√R0, implies\\nd\\ndt∥r − ¯r∥ ≤ ∥Kt − K0∥∥r∥ ≤2Lip(h)Lip(Dh)∥w − w0∥\\np\\nR0. (15)\\nUsing the Lipschitzness of the model, it was further shown that the weight change is bounded by ∥w(t) − w0∥ ≤t√R0Lip(h)/α.\\nPlugging this into (7) yields the bound in Proposition 1.1,\\n∥αh(w(T)) − α¯h( ¯w(T))∥ = ∥r(T) − ¯r(T)∥ ≤2Lip(h)2Lip(Dh)R0α−1\\nZ T\\n0\\ntdt = T2Lip(h)2Lip(Dh)R0/α. (16)\\n**First attempt: strengthening of the bound for long time horizons** We demonstrate how to strengthen this bound to hold for longer\\ntime horizons by employing an improved bound on the movement of the weights. Consider the following bound on the weight\\nchange.\\n**Proposition 3.1 (Bound on weight change, implicit in proof of Theorem 2.2).**\\n∥w(T) − w0∥ ≤\\np\\nT R0/α and ∥ ¯w(T) − w0∥ ≤\\np\\nT R0/α. (17)\\n**Proof of Proposition 3.1.** By (a) Cauchy-Schwarz, and (b) the nonnegativity of the loss R,\\n∥w(T) − w(0)∥ ≤\\nZ T\\n0\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\ndw\\ndt\\n\\r\\r\\r\\rdt\\n(a)\\n≤\\ns\\nT\\nZ T\\n0\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\ndw\\ndt\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\n2\\ndt =\\ns\\n− T\\nα2\\nZ T\\n0\\nd\\ndtR(αh(w(t)))dt\\n(b)\\n≤\\np\\nT R0/α. (18)\\nThe bound for ¯w is analogous.\\nThis bound (8) has the advantage of\\n√\\nt dependence (instead of linear t dependence) and does not depend on Lip(h). Plugging it\\ninto (7), we obtain\\n∥αh(w(T)) − α¯h( ¯w(T))∥ ≤2Lip(h)Lip(Dh)R0α−1\\nZ T\\n0\\n√\\ntdt = 4\\n3T3/2Lip(h)Lip(Dh)R0/α. (19)\\nThis improves over Proposition 1.1 for long time horizons, as the time dependence scales as T3/2 instead of T2. However, it still\\ndepends on the Lipschitz constant Lip(h) and falls short of the linear in T dependence of Theorem 1.2.\\n**Second attempt: new approach to prove Theorem 1.2** To avoid dependence onLip(h) and achieve a linear dependence in T,\\nwe develop a new approach. We cannot use (7), which was central to the original proof, as it depends onLip(h). Furthermore, to\\nachieve linear T dependence using (7), we would need ∥w − w0∥ = O(1) for a constant independent of the time horizon, which is\\nnot true unless the problem is well-conditioned.\\n3In the full proof in Appendix A, we bound ∥r(T) − ¯r(T)∥, which requires working with a product integral formulation of the\\ndynamics of r to handle the time-varying kernels Kt. The main technical innovation in the proof is Theorem A.8, which is a new,\\ngeneral bound on the difference between product integrals.\\nTo avoid the technical complications of the appendix, we provide some intuitions here by proving a simplified theorem that does not\\nimply the main result. We show:\\n**Theorem 3.2 (Simplified variant of Theorem 1.2).** Considerr′(t) ∈ Finitialized as r′(0) = r(0) and evolving as dr′\\ndt = −KT r′.\\nThen,\\n∥r′(T) − ¯r(T)∥ ≤min(3κ\\np\\nR0, 8R0). (20)\\nIntuitively, if we can prove in Theorem 3.2 that r′(T) and ¯r(T) are close, then the same should hold for r(T) and ¯r(T) as in\\nTheorem 1.2. For convenience, define the operators\\nA = Dh(w0)∗ and B = Dh(w(T))∗ − Dh(w0)∗. (21)\\nSince the kernels do not vary in time, the closed-form solution is\\nr′(t) = e−(A+B)∗(A+B)tr(0) and ¯r(t) = e−A∗Atr(0) (22)\\nWe prove that the time evolution operators forr′ and ¯r are close in operator norm.\\n**Lemma 3.3.** For any t ≥ 0, we have ∥e−(A+B)∗(A+B)t − e−A∗At∥ ≤2\\n√\\nt∥B∥.\\n**Proof of Lemma 3.3.** Define Z(ζ) = (A + ζB)∗(A + ζB)t. By the fundamental theorem of calculus,\\n∥e−(A+B)∗(A+B)t − e−A∗At∥ = ∥eZ(1) − eZ(0)∥ =\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nZ 1\\n0\\nd\\ndζ eZ(ζ)dζ\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r ≤ sup\\nζ∈[0,1]\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nd\\ndζ eZ(ζ)\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r. (23)\\nUsing the integral representation of the exponential map,\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nd\\ndζ eZ(ζ)\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r =\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nZ 1\\n0\\ne(1−τ)Z(ζ)\\n\\x12 d\\ndζ Z(ζ)\\n\\x13\\neτZ (ζ)dτ\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r =\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nZ 1\\n0\\ne(1−τ)Z(ζ)(A∗B + B∗A + 2ζB∗B)eτZ (ζ)dτ\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r (24)\\nBy symmetry under transposing and reversing time, it suffices to bound the first term. Since ∥eτZ (ζ)∥ ≤1,\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r\\nZ 1\\n0\\ne(1−τ)Z(ζ)(A + ζB)∗BeτZ (ζ)tdτ\\n\\r\\r\\r\\r ≤\\nZ 1\\n0\\n∥e(1−τ)Z(ζ)(A + ζB)∗∥∥tB∥dτ ≤ 2t/e∥B∥ ≤2\\n√\\nt∥B∥ (25)\\nFinally, let us combine Lemma 3.3 with the weight-change bound in Proposition 3.1 to prove Theorem 3.2. Notice that the\\nweight-change bound in Proposition 3.1 implies\\n∥B∥ ≤Lip(Dh)∥w(T) − w0∥ ≤Lip(Dh)\\np\\nT R0/α. (26)\\nSo Lemma 3.3 implies\\n∥r′(T) − ¯r(T)∥ ≤2Lip(Dh)T\\np\\nR0α−1∥r(0)∥ = 2κ∥r(0)∥. (27)\\nCombining this with ∥r′(T) − ¯r(T)∥ ≤ ∥r′(T)∥ + ∥¯r(T)∥ ≤2√2R0 implies (9). Thus, we have shown Theorem 3.2, which is the\\nresult of Theorem 1.2 if we replace r by r′. The actual proof of the theorem handles the time-varying kernel Kt and is in Appendix\\nA.\\n3.2 Proof Ideas for Theorem 1.3\\nThe converse in Theorem 1.3 is achieved in the simple case where h(w) = aw + 1\\n2 bw2 for a = 1/\\n√\\nT and b = Lip(Dh), and\\nw0 = 0 and R(y) = 1\\n2 (y − √2R0)2, as we show in Appendix B by direct calculation.\\n4 Discussion\\nA limitation of our result is that it applies only to gradient flow, which corresponds to SGD with infinitesimally small step size.\\nHowever, larger step sizes are beneficial for generalization in practice, so it would be interesting to understand the validity of the\\nNTK approximation in that setting. Another limitation is that our result applies only to the square loss and not to other popular\\nlosses such as the cross-entropy loss. Indeed, the known bounds in the setting of general losses require either a \"well-conditioning\"\\nassumption or taking α exponential in the training time T. Can one prove bounds analogous to Theorem 1.2 for more general losses,\\nwith α depending polynomially on T, and without conditioning assumptions?\\nA natural question raised by our bounds in Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 is: how do the dynamics behave just outside the regime where the\\nNTK approximation is valid? For models h where Lip(h) and Lip(Dh) are bounded by a constant, can we understand the dynamics\\nin the regime where T ≈ Cα for some large constant C and α ≫ C, at the edge of the lazy training regime?\\n4'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'JueWu-MC: Achieving Sample-Efficient Minecraft\\nGameplay through Hierarchical Reinforcement\\nLearning\\nAbstract\\nLearning rational behaviors in open-world games such as Minecraft continues to\\npose a challenge to Reinforcement Learning (RL) research, due to the combined\\ndifficulties of partial observability, high-dimensional visual perception, and delayed\\nrewards. To overcome these challenges, we propose JueWu-MC, a sample-efficient\\nhierarchical RL method that incorporates representation learning and imitation\\nlearning to handle perception and exploration. Our approach has two levels of\\nhierarchy: the high-level controller learns a policy to manage options, while the\\nlow-level workers learn to solve each sub-task. To boost learning of sub-tasks,\\nwe propose a combination of techniques including: 1) action-aware represen-\\ntation learning, which captures relations between action and representation; 2)\\ndiscriminator-based self-imitation learning for efficient exploration; and 3) ensem-\\nble behavior cloning with consistency filtering for policy robustness. Extensive\\nexperiments demonstrate that JueWu-MC significantly enhances sample efficiency\\nand outperforms several baselines. We won the championship of the MineRL 2021\\nresearch competition and achieved the highest performance score.\\n1 Introduction\\nDeep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success in numerous game genres including\\nboard games, Atari games, simple first-person-shooter (FPS) games, real-time strategy (RTS) games,\\nand multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games. Recently, open-world games have garnered\\nattention due to their playing mechanisms and their resemblance to real-world control tasks. Minecraft,\\nas a typical open-world game, has been increasingly explored in recent years.\\nCompared to other games, the properties of Minecraft make it an ideal testbed for RL research,\\nbecause it emphasizes exploration, perception, and construction in a 3D open world. Agents are given\\npartial observability and face occlusions. Tasks in the game are chained and long-term. Humans can\\ntypically make rational decisions to explore basic items and construct more complex items with a\\nreasonable amount of practice, while it can be challenging for AI agents to do so autonomously. To\\nfacilitate the effective decision-making of agents in playing Minecraft, MineRL has been developed\\nas a research competition platform, which provides human demonstrations and encourages the\\ndevelopment of sample-efficient RL agents for playing Minecraft. Since its release, many efforts\\nhave been made to develop Minecraft AI agents.\\nHowever, it remains difficult for current RL algorithms to acquire items in Minecraft due to several\\nfactors, which include the following. First, in order to reach goals, the agent is required to complete\\nmany sub-tasks that highly depend on each other. Due to the sparse reward, it is difficult for agents\\nto learn long-horizon decisions efficiently. Hierarchical RL from demonstrations has been explored\\nto take advantage of the task structure to accelerate learning. However, learning from unstructured\\ndemonstrations without any domain knowledge remains difficult. Second, Minecraft is a flexible\\n3D first-person game which revolves around gathering resources and creating structures and items.\\nIn this environment, agents are required to handle high-dimensional visual input to enable efficient\\n.control. However, the agent’s surroundings are varied and dynamic, which makes it difficult to learn\\na good representation. Third, with partial observability, the agent needs to explore in the right way\\nand collect information from the environment in order to achieve goals. Naive exploration can waste\\na lot of samples on useless actions. Self-imitation learning (SIL) is a simple method that learns to\\nreproduce past good behaviors to incentivize exploration, but it is not sample efficient. Lastly, human\\ndemonstrations are diverse and often noisy.\\nTo address these combined challenges, we propose an efficient hierarchical RL approach, equipped\\nwith novel representation and imitation learning techniques. Our method leverages human demonstra-\\ntions to boost the learning of agents, enabling the RL algorithm to learn rational behaviors with high\\nsample efficiency.\\nHierarchical Planning with Prior. We propose a hierarchical RL (HRL) framework with two\\nlevels of hierarchy. The high-level controller extracts sub-goals from human demonstrations and\\nlearns a policy to control options, while the low-level workers learn sub-tasks to achieve sub-goals\\nby leveraging demonstrations and interactions with environments. Our approach structures the\\ndemonstrations and learns a hierarchical agent, which enables better decisions over long-horizon\\ntasks. We use the following key techniques to boost agent learning.\\nAction-aware Representation Learning. We propose action-aware representation learning (A2RL)\\nto capture the relations between action and representation in 3D visual environments such as Minecraft.\\nA2RL enables effective control and improves the interpretability of the learned policy.\\nDiscriminator-based Self-imitation Learning. We propose discriminator-based self-imitation\\nlearning (DSIL), which leverages self-generated experiences to learn self-correctable policies for\\nbetter exploration.\\nEnsemble Behavior Cloning with Consistency Filtering. We propose consistency filtering to\\nidentify common human behaviors, and then perform ensemble behavior cloning to learn a robust\\nagent with reduced uncertainty.\\nOur contributions are as follows: 1) We propose JueWu-MC, a sample-efficient hierarchical RL\\napproach, equipped with action-aware representation learning, discriminator-based self-imitation,\\nand ensemble behavior cloning with consistency filtering. 2) Our approach outperforms competitive\\nbaselines and achieves the best performance throughout the history of the competition.\\n2 Related Work\\n2.1 Game AI\\nGames have long been a testing ground for artificial intelligence research. AlphaGo mastered the\\ngame of Go with DRL and tree search. Since then, DRL has been used in other sophisticated games,\\nincluding StarCraft, Google Football, VizDoom, and Dota. Recently, the 3D open-world game\\nMinecraft has been attracting attention. Previous research has shown that existing RL algorithms\\ncan struggle to generalize in Minecraft and a new memory-based DRL architecture was proposed to\\naddress this. Another approach combines a deep skill array and a skill distillation system to promote\\nlifelong learning and transfer knowledge among different tasks. Since the MineRL competition began\\nin 2019, many solutions have been proposed to learn to play in Minecraft. These works can be\\ngrouped into two categories: 1) end-to-end learning; 2) hierarchical RL with human demonstrations.\\nOur approach belongs to the second category, which leverages the structure of the tasks and learns\\na hierarchical agent to play in Minecraft. ForgER proposed a hierarchical method with forgetful\\nexperience replay, and SEIHAI fully takes advantage of human demonstrations and task structure.\\n2.2 Sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning\\nOur work aims to create a sample-efficient RL agent for playing Minecraft, and we thereby develop a\\ncombination of efficient learning techniques. We discuss the most relevant works below.\\nOur work is related to HRL research that builds upon human priors. One approach proposes to\\nwarm-up the hierarchical agent from demonstrations and fine-tune it with RL algorithms. Another\\napproach proposes to learn a skill prior from demonstrations to accelerate HRL algorithms. Compared\\nto existing works, we are faced with highly unstructured demos in 3D first-person video games played\\n2by the crowds. We address this challenge by structuring the demonstrations and defining sub-tasks\\nand sub-goals automatically.\\nRepresentation learning in RL has two broad directions: self-supervised learning and contrastive\\nlearning. Self-supervised learning aims to learn rich representations for high-dimensional unlabeled\\ndata to be useful across tasks. Contrastive learning learns representations that obey similarity\\nconstraints. Our work proposes a self-supervised representation learning method that measures action\\neffects in 3D video games.\\nExisting methods use curiosity or uncertainty as a signal for exploration so that the learned agent\\nis able to cover a large state space. The exploration-exploitation dilemma drives us to develop self-\\nimitation learning (SIL) methods that focus on exploiting past good experiences for better exploration.\\nWe propose discriminator-based self-imitation learning (DSIL).\\n3 Method\\nIn this section, we first introduce our overall HRL framework, and then describe each component in\\ndetail.\\n3.1 Overview\\nOur overall framework is shown in Figure 1. We define human demonstrations asD = {τ0, τ1, τ2, ...}\\nwhere τi is a long-horizon trajectory containing states, actions, and rewards. The provided demon-\\nstrations are unstructured, without explicit signals that specify sub-tasks and sub-goals.\\nWe define an atomic skill as a skill that gets a non-zero reward. We define sub-tasks and sub-goals\\nbased on the atomic skills. To define sub-tasks, we examine the reward delay for each atomic skill,\\nkeeping those with long reward delays as individual sub-tasks and merging those with short reward\\ndelays into one sub-task. Through this process, we have n sub-tasks in total. To define sub-goals for\\neach sub-task, we extract the most common human behavior pattern and use the last state in each\\nsub-task as its sub-goal. Through this, we have structured demonstrations (D → {D0, D1, ..., Dn−1}\\n) with sub-tasks and sub-goals used to train the hierarchical agent. With the structured demonstrations,\\nwe train the meta-policy using imitation learning and train sub-policies to solve sub-tasks using\\ndemonstrations and interactions with the environment.\\n3.2 Meta- and Sub-policies\\nMeta-policy. We train a meta-policy that maps continuous states to discrete indices (0, 1, ..., n - 1)\\nthat specify which option to use. Given state space S and discrete option o ∈ O, the meta-policy is\\ndefined as πm(θ)(o|s), where s ∈ S, o ∈ O, and θ represents the parameters. πm(θ)(o|s) specifies\\nthe conditional distribution over the discrete options. To train the meta-policy, we generate training\\ndata (s, i) where i represents the i-th stage and s ∈ Di is sampled from the demonstrations of the i-th\\nstage. The meta-policy is trained using negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss:\\nLm = −Pn−1\\ni=0 log πm(i|s)\\nDuring inference, the meta-policy generates options by taking\\nσ = argmaxoπm(o|s)\\nSub-policy. In Minecraft, sub-tasks can be grouped into two main types: gathering resources, and\\ncrafting items. In the first type (gathering resources), agents need to navigate and gather sparse\\nrewards by observing high-dimensional visual inputs. In the second type (crafting items), agents need\\nto execute a sequence of actions robustly.\\nIn typical HRL, the action space of the sub-policies is predefined. However, in the competition, a\\nhandcrafted action space is prohibited. Additionally, the action space is obfuscated in both human\\ndemonstrations and the environment. Learning directly in this continuous action space is challenging\\nas exploration in a large continuous space can be inefficient. We use KMeans to cluster actions for\\neach sub-task using demonstration Di, and perform reinforcement learning and imitation learning\\nbased on the clustered action space.\\n3In the following section, we describe how to learn sub-policies efficiently to solve these two kinds of\\nsub-tasks.\\n3.3 Learning Sub-policies to Gather Resources\\nTo efficiently solve these sub-tasks, we propose action-aware representation learning and\\ndiscriminator-based self-imitation learning to facilitate the learning of sub-policies. The model\\narchitecture is shown in Figure 2.\\nAction-aware Representation Learning. To learn compact representations, we observe that in 3D\\nenvironments, different actions have different effects on high-dimensional observations. We propose\\naction-aware representation learning (A2RL) to capture the relation with actions.\\nWe learn a mask net on a feature map for each action to capture dynamic information between the\\ncurrent and next states. Let the feature map be fθ(s) ∈ RC×H×W and the mask net be mϕ(s, a) ∈\\n[0, 1]H×W , where θ and ϕ represent parameters of the policy and mask net. Given a transition tuple\\n(s, a, s′), the loss function for training the mask is:\\nLm(ϕ) = −Es,a,s′∼D[log(σ((fθ(s′) − gψ(fθ(s))) ⊙ mϕ(s, a))) + η(1 − mϕ(s, a))]\\nwhere gψ is a linear projection function parameterized by learnable parameters ψ; ⊙ represents\\nelement-wise product, and η is a hyper-parameter that balances two objectives.\\nTo optimize the above loss function, we use a two-stage training process. In the first stage, we train\\nthe linear projection network gψa using the following objective:\\nLg(ψa) = Es,a,s′∼D[||fθ(s′) − gψa (fθ(s))||2]\\nThis objective learns to recover information of s′ from s in latent space, which is equal to learning a\\ndynamic model to predict the next state given the current state and action. Note that the parameter ψ\\nis dependent on the action a. In the second stage, we fix the learned linear function gψa and optimize\\nthe mask net.\\nBy minimizing the loss function, the mask net will learn to focus on local parts of the current image\\nthat are uncertain to the dynamic model. This is similar to human curiosity, which focuses on that\\nwhich is uncertain.\\nFor policy-based methods, we integrate our learned representations into policy networks. For value-\\nbased methods, we combine our learned representations directly with Q-value functions. The learning\\nof the Q-value function can be done using any Q-learning based algorithms.\\nDiscriminator-based Self-imitation Learning. We propose discriminator-based self-imitation\\nlearning (DSIL). Unlike ASIL, DSIL does not use advantage clipping. Our intuition is that the agent\\nshould be encouraged to visit the state distribution that is more likely to lead to goals.\\nTo do so, DSIL learns a discriminator to distinguish between states from successful and failed\\ntrajectories, and then uses the learned discriminator to guide exploration. We maintain two replay\\nbuffers B+\\ni and B−\\ni to store successful and failed trajectories. During learning, we treat data from\\nB+\\ni as positive samples and data from B−\\ni as negative samples to train the discriminator. Let the\\ndiscriminator be Dξ : S → [0, 1] which is parameterized by parameters ξ. We train the discriminator\\nwith the objective:\\nmaxξEs∈B+\\ni\\n[log Dξ(s)] + Es∈B−\\ni\\n[1 − log Dξ(s)]\\nThe discriminator is encouraged to output high values for good states and low values for bad states.\\nFor states that are not distinguishable, Dξ(s) tends to output 0.5.\\nWe use the trained discriminator to provide intrinsic rewards for policy learning to guide exploration.\\nThe intrinsic reward is defined as:\\nr(s, a, s′) = {+ 1ifDξ(s′) > 1 − ϵ\\n− 1ifDξ(s′) < ϵ\\nwhere ϵ ∈ (0, 0.5) is a hyper-parameter to control the confidence interval of Dξ. This reward drives\\nthe policy to explore in regions that previously led to successful trajectories. DSIL encourages the\\npolicy to stay close to a good state distribution, reproduce past decisions, and also be self-correctable.\\n43.4 Learning Sub-policies to Craft Items\\nIn this type of sub-task, agents must learn a sequence of actions to craft items. To finish such tasks,\\nagents need to learn a robust policy to execute a sequence of actions.\\nWe explore pure imitation learning (IL) to reduce the need for interactions with the environment, due\\nto the limited sample and interaction usage. We propose ensemble behavior cloning with consistency\\nfiltering (EBC).\\nConsistency Filtering. Human demonstrations can be diverse and noisy. Directly imitating such noisy\\ndata can cause confusion for the policy. Therefore, we perform consistency filtering by extracting\\nthe most common pattern of human behaviors. We extract the most common action sequence from\\ndemonstrations Di. For each trajectory, we keep those actions that lead to a state change while\\nappearing for the first time to form an action sequence, and count the occurrences of each pattern.\\nWe then get the most common action pattern. Afterward, we conduct consistency filtering using the\\nextracted action pattern.\\nEnsemble Behavior Cloning. Learning policy from offline datasets can lead to generalization\\nissues. Policies learned through behavior cloning may become uncertain when encountering unseen\\nout-of-distribution states. To mitigate this, EBC learns a population of policies on different subsets of\\ndemonstrations to reduce the uncertainty of the agent’s decision. Specifically, we train K policies on\\ndifferent demonstrations with NLL loss:\\nminθk Es,a∼ ¯Dk\\ni\\n[−log πθk (a|s)], ¯Dk\\ni ⊂ ¯Di, k = 1, 2, ..., K\\nwhere θk parameterizes the k-th policy. During inference, EBC adopts a majority voting mechanism\\nto select an action that is the most confident among the policies.\\n4 Experiment\\nWe conduct experiments using the MineRL environment. Our approach is built based on RL\\nalgorithms including SQIL, PPO, and DQfD.\\n4.1 Main Results\\nTable 1 shows all the MineRL competition results since 2019. The competition settings in 2020 and\\n2021 were more difficult than in 2019. In these years, participants had to focus on the algorithm\\ndesign itself. The scores in 2020 and 2021 are lower than in 2019. Our approach outperforms all\\nprevious solutions. End-to-end baselines cannot achieve a decent result, showing it is difficult to\\nsolve long-horizon tasks with end-to-end learning. Compared to the results of the 2020 competition,\\nour method outperforms other solutions with a score (76.97) that is 3.4x higher than the second place\\nscore (22.97). Table 2 shows the conditional success rate of each stage between our approach and\\nSEIHAI. Our approach outperforms SEIHAI in every stage.\\nFigure 3(a) shows the training curves. Due to a version update of MineRL 2021, our online score\\ndropped compared with the performance in our training curve. Our approach is sample-efficient and\\noutperforms prior best results with 0.5 million training samples. Our score reaches 100 with 2.5\\nmillion training samples, which is less than the 8 million samples of the MineRL competition.\\n4.2 Ablation Study\\nTo examine the effectiveness of our proposed techniques, we consider three variants of our approach:\\n1) without A2RL, 2) without DSIL, and 3) without EBC. Figure 3(b) shows the training curves. Each\\ntechnique contributes to the overall performance. EBC and A2RL contribute more than DSIL. DSIL\\nmainly boosts the performance for later sub-tasks, while A2RL and EBC have earlier effects on\\nthe overall pipeline. EBC contributes significantly, demonstrating that learning a robust policy is\\nimportant for solving long-horizon tasks.\\n54.3 Visualization\\nTo understand why our techniques work, we conduct an in-depth analysis. To understand the learned\\nmask in A2RL, we compute saliency maps. For each action, we show the current state, the next state,\\nand the saliency map of the learned mask on the current state. We find that the learned mask captures\\nthe dynamic information between two adjacent states, revealing curiosity on the effect of actions. The\\nmask net learns to focus on uncertain parts of the current state. For the ’attack’ action, the learned\\nmask focuses on the objects in front of the agent. For the ’turn left’ and ’turn down’ actions, the mask\\nnet focuses on the parts that have major changes due to the rotation and translation of the agent’s\\nperspective. Our learned mask assists the agent in better understanding the 3D environment.\\nTo understand how DSIL works, we visualize the state distribution that the agent visits. We compare\\nPPO, PPO+SIL, and PPO+DSIL. At the early training stage, both methods explore randomly and\\nsometimes reach the goal state successfully. After getting samples and training, PPO+DSIL starts to\\nexplore in a compact region, while PPO and PPO+SIL still explore in a wider region. DSIL pushes\\nthe agent to stay close to a good state distribution, reproducing its past behaviors and exploring in a\\nbetter way, which incentivizes deep exploration for successful trajectories.\\nTable 1: MineRL Competition Results.

       "  'file_content': 'Distant Supervision from Disparate Sources for\\nLow-Resource Part-of-Speech Tagging\\nAbstract\\nWe introduce DSDS: a cross-lingual neural part-of-speech tagger that learns from\\ndisparate sources of distant supervision, and realistically scales to hundreds of low-\\nresource languages. The model exploits annotation projection, instance selection,\\ntag dictionaries, morphological lexicons, and distributed representations, all in a\\nuniform framework. The approach is simple, yet surprisingly effective, resulting in\\na new state of the art without access to any gold annotated data.\\n1 Introduction\\nLow-resource languages lack manually annotated data to learn even the most basic models such\\nas part-of-speech (POS) taggers. To compensate for the absence of direct supervision, work in\\ncrosslingual learning and distant supervision has discovered creative use for a number of alternative\\ndata sources to learn feasible models:\\nHowever, only one or two compatible sources of distant supervision are typically employed. In\\nreality severely under-resourced languages may require a more pragmatic “take what you can get”\\nviewpoint. Our results suggest that combining supervision sources is the way to go about creating\\nviable low-resource taggers.\\nWe propose a method to strike a balance between model simplicity and the capacity to easily integrate\\nheterogeneous learning signals.\\nsystem is a uniform neural model for POS tagging that learns from disparate sources of distant\\nsupervision (DSDS). We use it to combine: i) multi-source annotation projection, ii) instance\\nselection, iii) noisy tag dictionaries, and iv) distributed word and sub-word representations. We\\nexamine how far we can get by exploiting only the wide-coverage resources that are currently readily\\navailable for more than 300 languages, which is the breadth of the parallel corpus we employ.\\nDSDS yields a new state of the art by jointly leveraging disparate sources of distant supervision in an\\nexperiment with 25 languages. We demonstrate: i) substantial gains in carefully selecting high-quality\\ninstances in annotation projection, ii) the usefulness of lexicon features for neural tagging, and iii)\\nthe importance of word embeddings initialization for faster convergence.\\n2 Method\\nDSDS is illustrated in Figure 1. The base model is a bidirectional long short-term memory network\\n(bi-LSTM)\\nAnnotation projection. Ever since the seminal work of projecting sequential labels from source to\\ntarget languages has been one of the most prevalent approaches to crosslingual learning. Its only\\nrequirement is that parallel texts are available between the languages, and that the source side is\\nannotated for POS.\\nWe apply the approach by where labels are projected from multiple sources and then decoded through\\nweighted majority voting with word alignment probabilities and source POS tagger confidences. Weexploit their widecoverage Watchtower corpus (WTC), in contrast to the typically used Europarl data.\\nEuroparl covers 21 languages of the EU with 400k-2M sentence pairs, while WTC spans 300+ widely\\ndiverse languages with only 10-100k pairs, in effect sacrificing depth for breadth, and introducing a\\nmore radical domain shift. However, as our results show little projected data turns out to be the most\\nbeneficial, reinforcing breadth for depth.\\nWhile selected 20k projected sentences at random to train taggers, we propose a novel alternative:\\nselection by coverage. We rank the target sentences by percentage of words covered by word\\nalignment from 21 sources and select the top k covered instances for training. In specific, we employ\\nthe mean coverage ranking of target sentences, whereby each target sentence is coupled with the\\narithmetic mean of the 21 individual word alignment coverages for each of the 21 source-language\\nsentences. We show that this simple approach to instance selection offers substantial improvements:\\nacross all languages, we learn better taggers with significantly fewer training instances.\\nDictionaries. Dictionaries are a useful source or distant supervision. There are several ways to\\nexploit such information: i) as type constraints during encoding, ii) to guide unsupervised learning,\\nor iii) as addiional signal at training. We focus on the latter and evaluate two ways to integrate\\nlexical knowledge into neural models, while comparing to the former wo: a) by representing lexicon\\nproperties as n-hot vector (e.g., if a word has two properties according to lexicon src, it results\\nin a 2-hot vector, if the word is not present in src, a zero vector), with m the number of lexicon\\nproperties; b) by embedding the lexical features, i.e., is a lexicon src embedded into an /-dimensional\\nspace. We represent as concatenation of all embedded m properies of length [, and a zero vector\\notherwise. Tuning on the dev set, we found the second embedding approach to perform best, and\\nsimple concatenaion outperformed mean vector representations.\\nWe evaluate two dictionary sources, motivated by ease of accessibility to many languages: WIK-\\nTIONARY , a word type dictionary that maps tokens to one of the 12 Universal POS tags; and\\nUNIMORPH, a morphological dictionary that provides inflectional paradigms across 350 languages.\\nFor Wiktionary, we use the freely available dictionaries from The size of the dictionaries ranges from\\na few thousands (e.g., Hindi and Bulgarian) to 2M (Finnish UniMorph). Sizes are provided in Table\\n1, 1st columns. UniMorph covers between 8-38 morphological properties (for English and Finnish,\\nrespectively).\\nWord embeddings. Embeddings are available for many languages. Pre-initialization of offers\\nconsistent and considerable performance improvements in our distant supervision setup (Section 4).\\nWe use off-the-shelf Polyglot embeddings, which performed consistently better than FastText.\\n3 Experiments\\nBaselines. We compare to the following weaklysupervised POS taggers: AGIC: Multi-source\\nannotation projection with Bible parallel data DAS: The label propagation approach by over Europarl\\ndata. GARRETTE: The approach by that works with projections, dictionaries, and unlabeled target\\ntext. LI: Wiktionary supervision.\\nData. Our set of 25 languages is motivated by accessibility to embeddings and dictionaries. In all\\nexperiments we work with the 12 Universal POS tags. For development, we use 21 dev sets of the\\nUniversal Dependencies 2.1. We employ UD test sets on additional languages as well as the test sets\\nof to facilitate comparisons. Their test sets are a mixture of CoNLL and HamleDT test data, and are\\nmore distant from the training and development data.\\nModel and parameters. We extend an off-theshelf state-of-the-art bi-LSTM tagger with lexicon\\ninformation. The code is available at: https:// github.com/bplank/bilstm-aux. The parameter l=40\\nwas set on dev data across all languages. Besides using 10 epochs, word dropout rate (p=.25) and\\n40-dimensional lexicon embeddings, we use the parameters from For all experiments, we average\\nover 3 randomly seeded runs, and provide mean accuracy. For the learning curve, we average over 5\\nrandom samples with 3 runs each.\\n4 Results\\nTable 1 shows the tagging accuracy for individual languages, while the means over all languages are\\ngiven in Figure 2. There are several take-aways.\\n2Data selection. The first take-away is that coverage-based instance selection yields substan-\\ntially better training data. Most prior work on annotation projection resorts to arbitrary selection;\\ninformed selection clearly helps in this noisy data setup, as shown in Figure 2 (a). Training on 5k\\ninstances results in a sweet spot; more data (10k) starts to decrease performance, at a cost of runtime.\\nTraining on all WTC data (around 120k) is worse for most languages. From now on we consider the\\n5k model trained with Polyglot as our baseline (Table 1, column “5k”), obtaining a mean accuracy of\\n83.0 over 21 languages.\\nEmbeddings initialization. Polyglot initialization offers a large boost; on average +3.8% absolute\\nimprovement in accuracy for our 5k training scheme, as shown in Figure 2 (b). The big gap in\\nlow-resource setups further shows their effectiveness, with up to 10% absolute increase in accuracy\\nwhen training on only 500 instances.\\nLexical information. The main take-away is that lexical information helps neural tagging, and\\nembedding it proves the most helpful. Embedding Wiktionary tags reaches 83.7 accuracy on average,\\nversus 83.4 for n-hot encoding, and 83.2 for type constraints. Only on 4 out of 21 languages are\\ntype constraints better. This is the case for only one language for n-hot encoding (French). The best\\napproach is to embed both Wiktionary and Unimorph, boosting performance further to 84.0, and\\nresulting in our final model. It helps the most on morphological rich languages such as Uralic.\\nOn the test sets (Table 4, right) DSDS reaches 87.2 over 8 test languages intersecting and. It reaches\\n86.2 over the more commonly used 8 languages of, compared to their 83.4. This shows that our\\nnovel “soft” inclusion of noisy dictionaries is superior to a hard decoding restriction, and including\\nlexicons in neural taggers helps. We did not assume any gold data to further enrich the lexicons, nor\\nfix possible tagset divergences.\\n5 Discussion\\nAnalysis. The inclusion of lexicons results in higher coverage and is part of the explanation for the\\nimprovement of DSDS; see correlation in Figure 3 (a). What is more interesting is that our model\\nbenefits from the lexicon beyond its content: OOV accuracy for words not present in the lexicon\\noverall improves, besides the expected improvement on known OOV , see Figure 3 (b).\\nMore languages. All data sources employed in our experiment are very high-coverage. However, for\\ntrue low-resource languages, we cannot safely assume the availability of all disparate information\\nsources. Table 2 presents results for four additional languages where some supervision sources\\nare missing. We observe that adding lexicon information always helps, even in cases where only\\n1k entries are available, and embedding it is usually the most beneficial way. For closely-related\\nlanguages such as Serbian and Croatian, using resources for one aids tagging the other, and modern\\nresources are a better fit. For example, using the Croatian WTC projections to train a model for\\nSerbian is preferable over in-language Serbian Bible data where the OOV rate is much higher.\\nHow much gold data? We assume not having access to any gold annotated data. It is thus interesting\\nto ask how much gold data is needed to reach our performance. This is a tricky question, as training\\nwithin the same corpus naturally favors the same corpus data. We test both in-corpus (UD)\\nand out-of-corpus data (our test sets) and notice an important gap: while in-corpus only 50 sentences\\nare sufficient, outside the corpus one would need over 200 sentences. This experiment was done for a\\nsubset of 18 languages with both inand out-ofcorpus test data.\\nFurther comparison. In Table 1 we directly report the accuracies from the original contributions by\\nDAS, LI, GARRETTE, and AGIC over the same test data. We additionally attempted to reach the\\nscores of LI by running their tagger over the Table 1 data setup. The results are depicted in Figure\\n4 as mean accuracies over EM iterations until convergence. We show: i) LI peaks at 10 iterations\\nfor their test languages, and at 35 iterations for all the rest. This is in slight contrast to 50 iterations\\nthat recommend, although selecting 50 does not dramatically hurt the scores; ii) Our replication falls\\n˘223c5 points short of their 84.9 accuracy. There is a large 33-point accuracy gap between the scores\\nof, where the dictionaries are large, and the other languages in Figure 4, with smaller dictionaries.\\nCompared to DAS, our tagger clearly benefits from pre-trained word embeddings, while theirs relies\\non label propagation through Europarl, a much cleaner corpus that lacks the coverage of the noisier\\nWTC. Similar applies to as they use 1-5M near-perfect parallel sentences. Even if we use much\\n3Table 1: Results on the development sets and comparison of our best model to prior work.

The intersection of xenolinguistics and\\npedology reveals a fascinating paradigm, wherein the communicative properties\\nof soil-dwelling microorganisms are juxtaposed with the deconstructed narratives\\nof postmodern literature, yielding a novel framework for comprehending the enig-\\nmatic dynamics of soil ecosystems, and the hermeneutics of pastry dough. Soil’s\\nsynergetic relationships with disparate entities, including, but not limited to, the\\nplatypus, and the harmonica, underscore the profound interconnectedness of our\\ncosmos, and the pressing need for a unified theory of soil-harmonica interactions,\\nwhich would, in turn, illuminate the mysteries of the universe, and the perfect\\nrecipe for lemon bars.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe fledgling discipline of soil-harmonica studies, an interdisciplinary endeavour, situated at the\\nnexus of pedology, musicology, and speculative fiction, promises to revolutionize our grasp of the\\nintricate, often surreal, dance between soil, sound waves, and the human experience, and will be\\ndiscussed in greater detail, in the following sections, which will delve into the intricacies of this\\nfascinating topic, and explore the uncharted territories of soil-harmonica research.\\nThe propensity for flamenco dancing to influence the viscosity of soil has been a topic of considerable\\ndebate amongst scholars of disparate disciplines, including botany, nanotechnology, and pastry arts.\\nAs we delve into the realm of soil dynamics, it becomes increasingly evident that the dichotomy\\nbetween theoretical frameworks and practical applications is tantamount to the disparities between\\nvarious types of extraterrestrial life forms and their respective culinary preferences. Furthermore, the\\nrole of color theory in shaping our understanding of soil properties cannot be overstated, particularly\\nwhen considering the profound impact of mauve and chartreuse on the crystalline structures of certain\\nsoil minerals, which in turn affect the trajectory of migratory bird patterns and the harmonic resonance\\nof acoustic guitars.\\nThe interconnectedness of these seemingly unrelated concepts is a testament to the boundless com-\\nplexity of soil as a multifaceted entity, defying reductionist approaches and inviting a more holistic,\\nperhaps even mystical, perspective. It is within this context that we find ourselves drawn to the\\nenigmatic realm of cryptozoology, where the search for elusive creatures like the Loch Ness Monster\\nand the Chupacabra serves as a metaphor for the elusive nature of soil itself, which, like these\\nmythical beings, remains shrouded in mystery and intrigue. As we navigate the uncharted territories\\nof soil science, we begin to uncover hidden patterns and synergies that underscore the profound inter-dependence of soil, ecosystems, and the human experience, including the oft-overlooked influence of\\n1980s pop culture on soil erosion rates and the viscosity of soil-water suspensions.\\nIn light of these findings, it is becoming increasingly clear that the traditional dichotomies between\\nsoil science, sociology, and surrealism are no longer tenable, and that a new paradigm is emerging,\\none that transcends disciplinary boundaries and invites a more fluid, perhaps even melancholic,\\nunderstanding of the soil-scape as a dynamic, ever-changing tapestry of relationships and processes.\\nThe notion that soil can be seen as a form of sentient, quasi-liquid entity, with its own agency and\\nconsciousness, is a notion that has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly among\\nscholars of postmodern soil theory, who argue that the very fabric of reality is inextricably linked to\\nthe moisture content and cation exchange capacity of soils worldwide. Moreover, the application\\nof chaos theory and fractal geometry to the study of soil morphology has yielded some fascinating\\ninsights into the self-similar patterns and scaling laws that govern the behavior of soil particles at\\nvarious spatial scales, from the minute to the cosmic.\\nAs we probe the depths of soil’s mysteries, we find ourselves confronting a dizzying array of paradoxes\\nand contradictions, including the eerie similarity between the branching patterns of root systems and\\nthe topology of certain types of fungal mycelium, which, in turn, bear an uncanny resemblance to the\\nbranching patterns of river networks and the fractal geometry of Romanesco broccoli. The search\\nfor a unified theory of soil, one that can reconcile these disparate threads and provide a coherent,\\noverarching framework for understanding the intricate web of relationships that comprise the soil\\necosystem, is a quest that has captivated the imagination of scholars and scientists for centuries, and\\none that continues to inspire new generations of researchers, who, like latter-day alchemists, seek to\\nunlock the secrets of the soil and reveal its hidden, perhaps even mystical, properties.\\nThe history of soil science is replete with examples of visionary thinkers and maverick researchers,\\nwho, through their groundbreaking work and unorthodox approaches, have helped to shape our\\nunderstanding of soil and its role in the grand tapestry of life. From the pioneering work of early\\nsoil scientists, who first recognized the importance of soil as a critical component of ecosystem\\nfunction, to the modern-day proponents of regenerative agriculture and soil conservation, who seek\\nto promote a more sustainable and holistic approach to soil management, the story of soil science is\\none of fascination, discovery, and transformation. And yet, despite the many advances that have been\\nmade in our understanding of soil, there remains a profound sense of mystery and awe, a recognition\\nthat soil is, and will always be, a complex, multifaceted, and ultimately enigmatic entity, defying\\nreductionist explanations and inviting a more nuanced, perhaps even poetic, appreciation of its beauty,\\nits power, and its profound significance in the grand scheme of things.\\nThe role of intuition and creativity in soil science is a topic that has garnered relatively little attention,\\ndespite its potential to unlock new insights and perspectives on the nature of soil and its behavior. The\\nidea that soil scientists, like artists and musicians, can tap into a deep wellspring of inspiration and\\nimagination, allowing them to perceive patterns and relationships that might otherwise go unnoticed,\\nis a notion that challenges traditional notions of objectivity and scientific inquiry. And yet, it is\\nprecisely this willingness to venture into the unknown, to explore the uncharted territories of the\\nsoil-scape, that has led to some of the most significant breakthroughs and discoveries in the history of\\nsoil science, from the development of new soil classification systems to the discovery of novel soil\\nmicroorganisms with unique properties and potential applications.\\nAs we continue to explore the vast and mysterious realm of soil, we are reminded of the importance\\nof maintaining a sense of wonder, a sense of awe, and a sense of curiosity, for it is precisely this\\nopenness to experience, this willingness to be surprised and delighted, that allows us to perceive\\nthe intricate web of relationships that comprise the soil ecosystem, and to appreciate the beauty, the\\ncomplexity, and the profound significance of soil in all its many forms and manifestations. The study\\nof soil is, in many ways, a journey of self-discovery, a journey that takes us deep into the heart of the\\nearth, and deep into the recesses of our own minds and imaginations, where we may uncover hidden\\npatterns and synergies that reflect the very essence of our existence, and our place within the grand\\ntapestry of life.\\nIn the world of soil science, the boundaries between reality and fantasy are often blurred, and the\\ndistinctions between different disciplines and fields of study become increasingly tenuous. The\\nnotion that soil can be seen as a form of living, breathing entity, with its own metabolism, its own\\nrhythms, and its own patterns of growth and decay, is a notion that challenges traditional notions of\\nsoil as a mere inert substance, and invites a more dynamic, perhaps even animistic, understanding\\n2of the soil-scape as a complex, interconnected web of relationships and processes. The application\\nof concepts and principles from fields such as ecology, biology, and physics to the study of soil\\nhas yielded some fascinating insights into the behavior of soil particles and the dynamics of soil\\necosystems, and has helped to shed new light on the intricate web of relationships that comprise the\\nsoil-scape.\\nAs we delve deeper into the mysteries of soil, we begin to uncover a hidden world of wonder and\\nenchantment, a world of intricate patterns and relationships, of subtle energies and unseen forces,\\nthat underlies the visible landscape of the earth. The study of soil is, in many ways, a journey into\\nthe unknown, a journey that takes us deep into the heart of the earth, and deep into the recesses of\\nour own minds and imaginations, where we may uncover hidden secrets and mysteries that reflect\\nthe very essence of our existence, and our place within the grand tapestry of life. The realm of soil\\nscience is a realm of endless fascination, a realm of discovery and exploration, where the boundaries\\nbetween reality and fantasy are often blurred, and the distinctions between different disciplines and\\nfields of study become increasingly tenuous.\\nThe concept of soil as a complex, dynamic system, comprising a multitude of interacting components\\nand processes, is a concept that has far-reaching implications for our understanding of the natural\\nworld, and our place within it. The notion that soil is not just a passive substrate, but an active\\nparticipant in the grand drama of life, with its own agency, its own metabolism, and its own rhythms,\\nis a notion that challenges traditional notions of the natural world, and invites a more holistic, perhaps\\neven mystical, understanding of the intricate web of relationships that comprise the soil ecosystem.\\nAs we continue to explore the vast and mysterious realm of soil, we are reminded of the importance\\nof maintaining a sense of wonder, a sense of awe, and a sense of curiosity, for it is precisely this\\nopenness to experience, this willingness to be surprised and delighted, that allows us to perceive the\\nintricate patterns and relationships that comprise the soil-scape, and to appreciate the beauty, the\\ncomplexity, and the profound significance of soil in all its many forms and manifestations.\\nThe role of mythology and folklore in shaping our understanding of soil is a topic that has garnered\\nrelatively little attention, despite its potential to provide a unique window into the human experience,\\nand the ways in which we perceive and interact with the natural world. The idea that soil is imbued\\nwith spiritual significance, and that it plays a central role in the myths and legends of cultures around\\nthe world, is a notion that reflects the deep-seated human desire to connect with the natural world,\\nand to find meaning and purpose in our existence. The study of soil is, in many ways, a journey\\ninto the heart of human culture and experience, a journey that takes us deep into the recesses of our\\ncollective unconscious, where we may uncover hidden patterns and synergies that reflect the very\\nessence of our existence, and our place within the grand tapestry of life.\\nAs we explore the realm of soil science, we are reminded of the importance of maintaining a sense of\\nhumility, a sense of reverence, and a sense of respect for the natural world, and the intricate web of\\nrelationships that comprise the soil ecosystem.

known as \"flargles,\" that live on the\\nsurface of the vegetables and are responsible for their unique, wave-like behavior, which, in turn,\\nhas been found to have a profound impact on the growth

       "  'file_content': 'A Reverse Hierarchy Model for Predicting Eye\\nFixations\\nAbstract\\nA number of psychological and physiological evidences suggest that early visual\\nattention works in a coarse-to- fine way, which lays a basis for the reverse hierarchy\\ntheory (RHT). This theory states that attention propagates from the top level of\\nthe visual hierarchy that processes gist and abstract information of input, to the\\nbottom level that processes local details. Inspired by the theory, we develop a\\ncomputational model for saliency detection in images. First, the original image\\nis downsampled to different scales to constitute a pyramid. Then, saliency on\\neach layer is obtained by image super-resolution reconstruction from the layer\\nabove, which is defined as unpredictability from this coarse-to-fine reconstruction.\\nFinally, saliency on each layer of the pyramid is fused into stochastic fixations\\nthrough a probabilistic model, where attention initiates from the top layer and\\npropagates downward through the pyramid. Extensive experiments on two standard\\neye-tracking datasets show that the proposed method can achieve competitive\\nresults with state-of-the-art models.\\n1 Introduction\\nHuman vision system can selectively direct eyes to informative and salient parts of natural scenes.\\nThis ability allows adaptive and efficient allocation of limited computational resources to important\\nobjects. Though enjoying great potential in various applications of computer vision, predicting eye\\nfixations, however, remains a challenging task. The underlying difficulty inherits from the ambiguous\\nnotion of what attracts eye fixations, or what is salient. In fact, the theoretical investigation of visual\\nsaliency has aroused enduring controversies. One possible explanation often adopted in the design of\\nsaliency detection approaches is the Feature Integration Theory (FIT). According to FIT, attention\\nserves as a mechanism to coherently combine features for the perception of objects. Therefore,\\nstarting from , eye fixations are commonly predicted by directly conjoining saliency activations from\\nmultiple channels, which can be global and local channels, multiple features and so on.\\nAnatomical and physiological studies have shown that human visual system is organized hierarchically,\\nwhich is believed to be advantageous in efficient processing of visual input. Computational studies\\nhave shown that hierarchical models (e.g. HMAX, CDBN) are effective for object recognition. Most\\nsaliency detection models, however, do not seriously take this into account. An obvious method\\nto fill this gap is to develop hierarchical bottom-up models for saliency detection in the manner\\nof HMAX, CDBN and the like. But there exists theoretical alternatives. The Reverse Hierarchy\\nTheory (RHT) argues that parallel feedforward feature activation acts implicitly at first to construct a\\ncoarse gist of the scene, while explicit perception incrementally incorporates fine details via feedback\\ncontrol. This theory potentially has tremendous applications in computer vision including image\\nsegmentation, object recognition and scene understanding, however, computational studies are scarce.\\nIn this paper, we present an effective model based on RHT for saliency detection, which proves that\\nRHT is helpful at least in this particular computer vision application. As for this application, a more\\ndirect evidence for the proposed model refers to a psychophysical study which showed that fixations\\nfrom low-resolution images could predict fixations on higher-resolution images.\\n.Our main idea is to model the coarse-to-fine dynamics of visual perception. We take a simple strategy\\nto construct a visual hierarchy by inputting images at different layers with different scales, obtained\\nby downsampling the original image. The higher layers receive coarser input and lower layers receive\\nfiner input. On each layer, saliency is defined as unpredictability in coarse-to-fine reconstruction\\nthrough image super-resolution. The saliency on each layer is then fused into fixation estimate with a\\nprobabilistic model that mimics reverse propagation of attention. Throughout the paper, we call the\\nproposed model a reverse hierarchy model (RHM).\\nThe coarse-to-fine dynamics, however, is not the only property of RHT. In fact, RHT is closely related\\nto the biased competition theory of attention, which claims that attentional competition is biased\\nby either stimulus-driven or task-dependent factors. Our model deals with fixation prediction in\\nthe free viewing task, which can be regarded as an implementation of the stimulus-driven bias. In\\naddition, the image pyramid is a very coarse approximation of the highly complex structure of the\\nvisual hierarchy in the brain, which only utilizes the fact of increasing receptive field sizes along the\\nhierarchy. Therefore, some closely related concepts to RHT, such as perceptual learning, would not\\nbe discussed in the paper.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe majority of computational attention modeling studies follow the Feature Integration Theory.\\nIn particular, the pioneering work by first explored the computational aspect of FIT by searching\\nfor center-surround patterns across multiple feature channels and image scales. This method was\\nfurther extended through integration of color contrast, symmetry, etc. Random Center Surround\\nSaliency adopted a similar center-surround heuristic but with center size and region randomly sampled.\\nintroduced a graph-based model that treated feature maps as fully connected nodes, while the nodes\\ncommunicated according to their dissimilarity and distance in a Markovian way. Saliency was\\nactivated as the equilibrium distribution.\\nSeveral saliency models adopted a probabilistic approach and modeled the statistics of image features.\\nand Baldi defined saliency as surprise that arised from the divergence of prior and posterior belief.\\nSUN was a Bayesian framework using natural statistics, in which bottom-up saliency was defined as\\nself-information. proposed an attention model based on information maximization of image patches.\\ndefined the saliency by computing the Hotelling’s T-squared statistics of each multi-scale feature\\nchannel. considered saliency in a discriminative setting by defining the KL-divergence between\\nfeatures and class labels.\\nA special class of saliency detection schemes was frequency-domain methods. proposed a spectral\\nresidual method, which defined saliency as irregularities in amplitude information. explored the phase\\ninformation in the frequency domain with a Quaternion Fourier Transform. Recently, introduced a\\nsimple image descriptor, based on which a competitive fast saliency detection algorithm was devised.\\nDifferent from our proposal, the conventional practice in fusing saliency at different image scales and\\nfeature channels was through linear combination. proposed a model that combined a global saliency\\nmodel AIM and a local model through linear addition of normalized maps. Some models learned the\\nlinear combination weights for feature channels. trained a linear SVM from human eye fixation data\\nto optimally combine the activation of several low-, mid- and high-level features. With a similar idea,\\nadopted a regression-based approach.\\nOur model is characterized by a top-down flow of information. But it differs from most existing\\nsaliency detection models that incorporate top-down components such as in two aspects. First, a\\nbiased prior (e.g., context clues, object features, task-related factors) is often needed in those models,\\nserving as the goal of top-down modulation, which is not necessary in our model. Second, hierarchical\\nstructure of the visual cortex is not considered in those models, but plays a significant role in our\\nmodel.\\nNevertheless, there were a few preliminary studies trying to make use of the hierarchical structure for\\nsaliency detection and attention modeling. The Selective Tuning Model was such a model. It was\\na biologically plausible neural network that modeled visual attention as a forward winner-takes-all\\nprocess among units in each visual layer. A recent study used hierarchical structure to combine\\nmulti-scale saliency, with a hierarchical inference procedure that enforces the saliency of a region to\\nbe consistent across different layers.\\n23 Saliency from Image Super-Resolution\\nIn this section, a coarse-to-fine saliency model based on image super-resolution is presented. We\\nconsider an image at two consecutive scales in an image pyramid: a coarse one Il and a fine one\\nIh. Inspired by RHT, we define saliency as details in Ih that are unpredictable from Il. In the next\\nsection, we discuss how to fuse saliency on each layer of the pyramid into fixation estimate.\\n3.1 Saliency as Unpredictability\\nPredicting Ih using the information of Il is closely related to image super-resolution, which has\\nbeen extensively studied using techniques including Markov random field, example-based learning,\\ncompressive sensing, etc. In patch-based representation of images, the problem is to predict a high-\\nresolution H × H patch xh ∈ Ih from its low-resolution L × L counterpart xl ∈ Il. For convenience\\nof notation, we also use xh and xl as H2 and L2 dimensional vectors, which are computed by\\nreshaping the corresponding patches. Then xl is obtained by blurring and downsampling xh:\\nxl = GBxh, (1)\\nwhere B denotes a H2 × H2 blurring matrix (throughout the paper a Gaussian matrix is used) and G\\nrepresents a L2 × H2 downsampling matrix. Let zh denote the reconstructed patch by some method\\nA, which summarizes the best knowledge one can recover from the coarse perception ofxl, via A.\\nThe reconstruction error of zh from xh, naturally represents the fine-scale information that cannot be\\nrecovered. Therefore, we define saliency S(xh|xl) as the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE):\\nS(xh|zh) =||xh − zh||2\\n||xh||2 (2)\\nThe mean squared error is normalized so that S(xh|xl) is robust to variations of the patch energy\\n||xh||2.\\n3.2 Coarse-to-Fine Reconstruction\\nThe reconstruction from the coarse scale subject to the constraint (1) is actually not well-defined, since\\ngiven a low-resolution patch xl, there exists an infinite number of possible high-resolution patches\\nxh. To resolve this issue, the basic idea is to incorporate some prior knowledge, which inherits from\\nthe properties of natural images. In what follows we discuss several possible reconstruction schemes\\nwith increasingly sophisticated prior knowledge.\\nLinear Reconstruction (LR). Consider a trivial case: the coarse patch xl = Bxh, is just the blurred\\nversion and we do nothing but output zh = xl. Therefore, no prior is used in this case. Saliency can\\nbe computed according to (2). As shown in Fig. 2, this method assigns more saliency to patches\\ncontaining many high-frequency components like edges and textures.\\nBicubic Interpolation (BI). If we reconstruct xh using bicubic interpolation, then we utilize a\\nsmoothness prior in image interpolation. Although this approach concentrates less on edges than the\\nlinear reconstruction, its prediction is still far from the ground truth. See Fig. 2.\\nWith LR or BI, the saliency computed in (2) is the normalized l2-norm of the Laplacian pyramid. In\\naddition, the two techniques can be used to implement the center-surround strategy adopted in some\\nsaliency models, e.g. .\\nCompressive Sensing (CS). We now consider a more sophisticated prior of image structure – sparsity.\\nAccording to this prior, any patch xh of a high-resolution image can be sparsely approximated by a\\nlinear combination of items in a dictionary Dh:\\nxh ≈ Dhα, (3)\\nfor some sparse coefficients α that satisfies ||α||0 ≤ K for some small K. Assuming α is sparse,\\nthe theory of compressive sensing states that α can be recovered from sufficient measurements\\nxl = GBxh by solving the following optimization problem:\\nmin ||α||0subjectto||Dlα − xl|| < ϵ, (4)\\nwhere Dl = GBDh, denotes the blurred and downsampled dictionary Dh, and ϵ is the allowed error\\ntolerance. This is hard to solve, and in practice the following relaxed problem is often solved:\\nmin ||α||1subjectto||Dlα − xl|| < ϵ. (5)\\n3The coefficients α are then used to reconstruct zh by\\nzh = Dhα. (6)\\nOnce we have obtained zh, saliency of the image patch can be computed using (2). Preliminary\\nresults in Fig. 2 indicate that the saliency obtained by compressive sensing can largely differ from\\nthat obtained by LR and BIL.\\nThe dictionaries Dh and Dl are constructed as follows. For each scale of the image pyramid, we\\nfirst uniformly sample raw patches {dj}n\\nj=1 of size H × H (n > H2), and stack them into a high-\\nresolution dictionary Dh = [d1, d2, ..., dn]. Then we apply the blurring matrix B and downsampling\\nmatrix G to each dj, to obtain dj = GBdj. So Dl = [d1, d2, ..., dn] is the collection of corresponding\\nlow-resolution patches. The use of overcomplete raw patches forDh and Dl has been shown effective\\nfor image super-resolution.\\n3.3 Saliency Map\\nA saliency map M is obtained by collecting patch saliency defined in (2) over the entire image. First,\\ncalculate\\nM[i, j] =S(xh[i, j]|xl[i, j]), (7)\\nwhere xh[i, j] is the patch centered at pixel(i, j) in the image and xl[i, j] is its low-resolution version.\\nThen M is blurred with a Gaussian filter and normalized to be between[0, 1] to yield the final saliency\\nmap M. One should not confuse this Gaussian filter with B in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.\\n4 Reverse Propagation of Saliency\\nNow, we present a method to transform the saliency maps at different scales into stochastic eye\\nfixations on the original image. Based on RHT, a reverse propagation model is presented, where\\nattention initiates from top level and propagates downward through the hierarchy.\\n4.1 Generating Fixations\\nWe model attention as random variablesA0, A1, ..., An on saliency maps M0, M1, ..., Mn, which are\\nordered in a coarse-to-fine scale hierarchy. Specifically, letP r[Ak = (i, j)] denote the probability for\\npixel (i, j) attracting a fixation. To define this probability, we need to consider factors that influence\\nthe random variable Ak. First of all, the saliency map Mk is an important factor. Pixels with higher\\nvalues should receive more fixations. Second, according to RHT, attention starts from M0, and then\\ngradually propagates down along the hierarchy. Therefore, Ak should also depend on Ak−1, ..., A0.\\nFor simplicity, we assume that only Ak−1 has an influence on Ak while Ak−2, ..., A0 do not.\\nBased on these considerations, we define\\nP r[Ak|Mk, Ak−1, ..., A0] =P r[Ak|Mk, Ak−1], (8)\\nfor k = 1, ..., n. A log-linear model is used for this conditional probability\\nP r[Ak = (i, j)|Mk, Ak−1] ∝ exp(ηMk[i, j] +λL(Ak, Ak−1)), (9)\\nwhere L(Ak, Ak−1) is a spatial coherence term, η and λ are two constants. The spatial coherence\\nterm restricts the fixated patches to be close in space. The motivation of introducing this term\\ncomes from the fact that the visual system is more likely to amplify the response of neurons that is\\ncoherent with initial perception. To compute the term, we first convert the coordinate Ak−1 into the\\ncorresponding coordinate (u, v) in the saliency map just below it, i.e. Mk. Then compute\\nL(Ak, Ak−1) =−((i − u)2 + (j − v)2). (10)\\nIn other words, the farther away a patch x is from Ak−1, the less likely it would be attended by Ak.\\nTherefore, for predicting the fixation probability of any patch in the current layer, the model makes a\\ntradeoff between the spatial coherence with previous attention and its current saliency value.\\nIf we do not consider any prior on the top layer, P r[A0] depends on the saliency map only\\nP r[A0 = (i, j)] ∝ exp(ηM0[i, j]). (11)\\nWe can then generate fixations via an ancestral sampling procedure from the probability model.\\nSpecifically, we first sample fixation A0 on map M0 according to (11), and then for k = 1, 2, ...\\nsample Ak on map Mk given Ak−1 on the coarser scale according to (9). Finally, we collect all\\nsamples on the finest scale, and use them as prediction of the eye fixations.\\n44.2 Incorporating Prior of Fixations\\nThe proposed probabilistic model offers great flexibility for incorporating prior of fixations. This prior\\ncan be useful in capturing, for example, the top-down guidance of visual saliency from recognition,\\nor central bias in eye-tracking experiments. To achieve this, we extend the expression ofP r[A0] as\\nfollows:\\nP r[A0 = (i, j)] ∝ exp(ηM0[i, j] +θP [i, j]), (12)\\nwhere P[i, j] encodes the prior information of pixel (i, j) on the first map M0 and θ is a weighting\\nparameter.\\nFor example, the central bias can be incorporated into the model by setting P[i, j] =−[(i − cx)2 +\\n(j − cy)2], where (cx, cy) denotes the map center.\\n5 Experiments\\n5.1 Experiment Settings\\nDatasets. The performance of the proposed reverse hierarchy model (RHM) was evaluated on two\\nhuman eye-tracking datasets. One was the TORONTO dataset. It contained 120 indoor and outdoor\\ncolor images as well as fixation data from 20 subjects. The other was the MIT dataset, which\\ncontained 1003 images collected from Flicker and LabelMe. The fixation data was obtained from 15\\nsubjects.\\nParameters. The raw image I in RGB representation was downsampled by factors of 27, 9, 3 to\\nconstruct a coarse-to-fine image pyramid. The patch size for super-resolution was set as 9 × 9 on\\neach layer. To construct corresponding coarse patches, we used Gaussian blurring filter B (σ = 3)\\nand downsampling operator G with a factor of 3. A total of 1000 image patches were randomly\\nsampled from all images at the current scale to construct the dictionary Dh, which is then blurred and\\ndownsampled to build Dl.\\nIn some experiments, we included a center bias in the model. This is achieved by switching θ from 0\\nto 1 in (12).\\nNote that the reverse propagation described in (8)-(11) is a stochastic sampling procedure and we\\nneed to generate a large number of fixations to ensure unbiased sampling. We found that 20000 points\\non each image were enough to achieve good performance, which was adopted in all experiments.\\nThe stochastic points were then blurred with a Gaussian filter to yield the final saliency map. The\\nstandard deviation of the Gaussian filter was fixed as 4 pixels on saliency maps, which was about 5\\nEvaluation metric. Several metrics have been used to evaluate the performance of saliency models.\\nWe adopted Area Under Curve (AUC), Normalized Scanpath Saliency (NSS) and Similarity (S).\\nSpecifically, We used the AUC code from the GBVS toolbox, NSS code from and Similarity code\\nfrom . Following , we first matched the histogram of the saliency map to that of the fixation map\\nto equalize the amount of salient pixels in the map, and then used the matched saliency map for\\nevaluation. Note that AUC was invariant to this histogram matching.\\nModels for comparison. The proposed model was compared with several state-of-the-art models:\\nItti Koch, Spectral Residual Methods (SR), Saliency based on Information Maximization (AIM),\\nGraph Based Visual Saliency (GBVS), Image Signature (ImgSig), SUN framework and Adaptive\\nWhitening Saliency (AWS). The implementation of these models were based on publicly available\\ncodes/software. Among these models, GBVS, ImgSig and AWS usually performed better than the\\nothers.\\nInspired by the center bias, we included a Center model as a baseline, which was simply a Gaussian\\nfunction with mean at the center of the image and standard deviation being 1/4 of the image width.\\nThis simple model was also combined with other saliency detection models to account for the center\\nbias, which could boost accuracy of fixation prediction. Following , this was achieved by multiplying\\nthe center model with the saliency maps obtained by these models in a point-wise manner.\\n55.2 Results\\nFirst, we compared different super-resolution techniques (LR, BI and CS) for eye fixation prediction.\\nFig. 5 shows the results of RHM with the three techniques. The CS method significantly outperformed\\nLR and BI. Therefore, sparsity as a prior offers great advantage in discovering salient fine details. We\\nthen focused on RHM with CS in subsequent experiments.\\nFig. 4 shows some qualitative comparison of the proposed model against existing models. Table 5\\nshows quantitative results under three metrics. As we can see, no single model could dominate others\\nunder all three metrics. However, in most cases (including both “with” and “without center” settings),\\nthe RHM outperformed the current state-of-the-art models. This demonstrated the reverse hierarchy\\ntheory as a promising way to predict human eye fixations.\\n5.3 Contributions of Individual Components\\nThe RHM consists of two components: coarse-to-fine reconstruction (especially compressive sensing)\\nand reverse propagation. Although the two components integrated together showed promising results,\\nthe contribution of each component to the performance is unclear. This is discussed as follows.\\nCompressive sensing. To identify the role of compressive sensing, we substituted it with other saliency\\nmodels. Specifically, we replaced the saliency maps obtained from coarse-to-fine reconstruction\\nby the saliency maps obtained by existing models. The models designed to work on a single scale,\\nincluding SR, AIM, SUN, were applied to images of different scales to obtain multiple saliency maps.\\nFor multi-scale models such as Itti Koch, we use their intermediate single-scale results.\\nNotice that blurring with a Gaussian filter is a necessary step in our model to obtain a smooth saliency\\nmap from stochastic fixations. Previous results have shown that blurring improved the performance\\nof saliency models. For the sake of fairness, we also tested the models with the same amount of\\nblurring (the sigma of Gaussian) used in RHM. Fig. 6 shows the results on the TORONTO dataset.\\nThe reverse propagation procedure improved the AUC of these models. However, their performance\\nis still behind RHM. Therefore, compressive sensing is a critical component in the RHM.\\nReverse propagation. To investigate the effect of reverse propagation, we substituted it with linear\\ncombination of saliency maps, which is widely adopted in literature. Table 2 shows the results. The\\nlinear combination produced an AUC between the best and worst that a single saliency map could\\nachieve. However, RHM outperformed the best single-map performance. Therefore, through reverse\\npropagation, RHM could integrate complementary information in each map for better prediction.\\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\\nIn this paper, we present a novel reverse hierarchy model for predicting eye fixations based on a\\npsychological theory, reverse hierarch theory (RHT). Saliency is defined as unpredictability from\\ncoarse-to-fine image reconstruction, which is achieved by image super-resolution. Then a stochastic\\nfixation model is presented, which propagates saliency from from the top layer to the bottom layer to\\ngenerate 01xation esti- mate. Experiments on two benchmark eye-tracking datasets demonstrate the\\neffectiveness of the model.\\nThis work could be extended in several ways. First, it is worth exploring whether there exist better\\nsuper- resolution techniques than compressive sensing for the pro- posed framework. Second, it\\nis worth exploring if the ideas presented in the paper can be applied to a hierarchical struc- ture\\nconsisting of different level of features, which play a signi01cant role in the top-down modulation as\\nsuggested by RHT. Finally, in view of the similar hierarchical structure used in this study for saliency\\ndetection and other studies for object recognition, it would be interesting to devise a uni01ed model\\nfor both tasks.\\n6'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'AMR Parsing using Stack-LSTMs\\nAbstract\\nWe present a transition-based AMR parser that directly generates AMR parses from\\nplain text. We use Stack-LSTMs to represent our parser state and make decisions\\ngreedily. In our experiments, we show that our parser achieves very competitive\\nscores on English using only AMR training data. Adding additional information,\\nsuch as POS tags and dependency trees, improves the results further.\\n1 Introduction\\nTransition-based algorithms for natural language parsing are formulated as a series of decisions that\\nread words from a buffer and incrementally combine them to form syntactic structures in a stack.\\nApart from dependency parsing, these models, also known as shift-reduce algorithms, have been\\nsuccessfully applied to tasks like phrase-structure parsing, named entity recognition, CCG parsing,\\njoint syntactic and semantic parsing and even abstract- meaning representation parsing.\\nAMR parsing requires solving several natural language processing tasks; mainly named entity\\nrecognition, word sense disambiguation and joint syntactic and semantic role labeling. Given the\\ndifficulty of building an end-to-end system, most prior work is based on pipelines or heavily dependent\\non precalculated features.\\nInspired by we present a shift- reduce algorithm that produces AMR graphs directly from plain text.\\npresented transition-based tree-to-graph transducers that traverse a dependency tree and transforms\\nit to an AMR graph. input is a sentence and it is therefore more similar (with a different parsing\\nalgorithm) to our approach, but their parser relies on external tools, such as dependency parsing,\\nsemantic role labeling or named entity recognition.\\nThe input of our parser is plain text sentences and, through rich word representations, it predicts\\nall actions (in a single algorithm) needed to generate an AMR graph representation for an input\\nsentence; it handles the detection and annotation of named entities, word sense disambiguation and\\nit makes connections between the nodes detected towards building a predicate argument structure.\\nEven though the system that runs with just words is very competitive, we further improve the results\\nincorporating POS tags and dependency trees into our model.\\nStack-LSTMs have proven to be useful in tasks related to syntactic and semantic parsing and named\\nentity recognition. In this paper, we demonstrate that they can be effectively used for AMR parsing\\nas well.\\n2 Parsing Algorithm\\nOur parsing algorithm makes use of a STACK (that stores AMR nodes and/or words) and a BUFFER\\nthat contains the words that have yet to be processed. The parsing algorithm is inspired from the\\nsemantic actions presented by , the transition-based NER algorithm by and the arc-standard algorithm.\\nAs in the buffer starts with the root symbol at the end of the sequence. Figure 2 shows a running\\nexample. The transition inventory is the following:\\n• SHIFT: pops the front of the BUFFER and push it to the STACK.• CONFIRM: calls a subroutine that predicts the AMR node corresponding to the top of the\\nSTACK. It then pops the word from the STACK and pushes the AMR node to the STACK.\\nAn example is the prediction of a propbank sense: From occurred to occur-01.\\n• REDUCE: pops the top of the STACK. It occurs when the word/node at the top of the stack\\nis complete (no more actions can be applied to it). Note that it can also be applied to words\\nthat do not appear in the final output graph, and thus they are directly discarded.\\n• MERGE: pops the two nodes at the top of the STACK and then it merges them, it then\\npushes the resulting node to the top of STACK. Note that this can be applied recursively.\\nThis action serves to get multiword named entities (e.g. New York City).\\n• ENTITY(label): labels the node at the top of the STACK with an entity label. This action\\nserves to label named entities, such as New York City or Madrid and it is normally run after\\nMERGE when it is a multi-word named entity, or after SHIFT if it is a single-word named\\nentity.\\n• DEPENDENT(label,node): creates a new node in the AMR graph that is dependent on the\\nnode at the top of the STACK. An example is the introduction of a negative polarity to a\\ngiven node: From illegal to (legal, polarity -).\\n• LA(label) and RA(label): create a left/right arc with the top two nodes at the top of the\\nSTACK. They keep both the head and the dependent in the stack to allow reentrancies (multiple\\nincoming edges). The head is now a composition of the head and the dependent. They are enriched\\nwith the AMR label.\\n• SW AP: pops the two top items at the top of the STACK, pushes the second node to the front\\nof the BUFFER, and pushes the first one back into the STACK. This action allows non-\\nprojective arcs as in but it also helps to introduce reentrancies. At oracle time, SWAP is\\nproduced when the word at the top of the stack is blocking actions that may happen between\\nthe second element at the top of the stack and any of the words in the buffer.\\nFigure 1 shows the parser actions and the effect on the parser state (contents of the stack, buffer) and\\nhow the graph is changed after applying the actions.\\nWe implemented an oracle that produces the sequence of actions that leads to the gold (or close to\\ngold) AMR graph. In order to map words in the sentences to nodes in the AMR graph we need to\\nalign them. We use the JAMR aligner provided by. It is important to mention that even though the\\naligner is quite accurate, it is not perfect, producing a F1 score of around 0.90. This means that most\\nsentences have at least one alignment error which implies that our oracle is not capable of perfectly\\nreproducing all AMR graphs. This has a direct impact on the accuracy of the parser described in the\\nnext section since it is trained on sequences of actions that are not perfect. The oracle achieves 0.895\\nF1 Smatch score when it is run on the development set of the LDC2014T12.\\nThe algorithm allows a set of different constraints that varies from the basic ones (not allowing\\nimpossible actions such as SHIFT when the buffer is empty or not generating arcs when the words\\nhave not yet been CONFIRMed and thus transformed to nodes) to more complicated ones based on\\nthe propbank candidates and number of arguments. We choose to constrain the parser to the basic\\nones and let it learn the more complicated ones.\\n(r / recommend-01 :ARG1 (a / advocate-01 :ARG1 (i / it) :manner (v / vigorous)))\\n3 Parsing Model\\nIn this section, we revisit Stack-LSTMs, our parsing model and our word representations.\\n3.1 Stack-LSTMs\\nThe stack LSTM is an augmented LSTM that allows adding new inputs in the same way as LSTMs\\nbut it also provides a POP operation that moves a pointer to the previous element.

R represents the\\nroot symbol\\n33.2 Representing the State and Making Parsing Decisions\\nThe state of the algorithm presented in Section 2 is represented by the contents of the STACK,\\nBUFFER and a list with the history of actions (which are encoded as Stack-LSTMs). All of this\\nforms the vector st that represents the state which s calculated as follows:\\nst = max{0, W[st\\nt; bt; at] +d},\\nwhere W is a learned parameter matrix, d is a bias term and st\\nt, bt,at represent the output vector of\\nthe Stack-LSTMs at time t.\\nPredicting the Actions: Our model then uses the vector st for each timestep t to compute the\\nprobability of the next action as:\\np(z|st) = exp(gz.st+qz)P\\nz′∈A exp(g′z.st+q′z) ,\\nwhere gz is a column vector representing the (output) embedding of the action z, and qz is a bias term\\nfor action z. The set A represents the actions listed in Section 2. Note that due to parsing constraints\\nthe set of possible actions may vary. The total number of actions (in the LDC2014T12 dataset) is\\n478; note that they include all possible labels (in the case of LA and RA ) and the different dependent\\nnodes for the DEPENDENT action.\\nPredicting the Nodes: When the model selects the action CONFIRM, the model needs to decide the\\nAMR node that corresponds to the word at the top of the STACK, by usingst, as follows:\\np(e|st) = exp(ge.st+qe)P\\ne′∈N exp(ge′.st+qe′) ,\\nwhere N is the set of possible candidate nodes for the word at the top of the STACK.ge is a column\\nvector representing the (output) embedding of the node e, and qe is a bias term for the node e. It is\\nimportant to mention that this implies finding a propbank sense or a lemma. For that, we rely entirely\\non the AMR training set instead of using additional resources.\\nGiven that the system runs two softmax operations, one to predict the action to take and the second\\none to predict the corresponding AMR node, and they both share LSTMs to make predictions, we\\ninclude an additional layer with a tanh nonlinearity after st for each softmax.\\n3.3 Word Representations\\nWe use character-based representations of words using bidirectional LSTMs . They learn represen-\\ntations for words that are orthographically similar. Note that they are updated with the updates to\\nthe model. demonstrated that it is possible to achieve high results in syntactic parsing and named\\nentity recognition by just using character-based word representations (not even POS tags, in fact, in\\nsome cases the results with just character-based representations outperform those that used explicit\\nPOS tags since they provide similar vectors for words with similar/same morphosyntactic tag); in this\\npaper we show a similar result given that both syntactic parsing and named-entity recognition play a\\ncentral role in AMR parsing.\\nThese are concatenated with pretrained word embeddings. We use a variant of the skip n-gram model\\nwith the LDC English Gigaword corpus (version 5). These embeddings encode the syntactic behavior\\nof the words .\\nMore formally, to represent each input token, we concatenate two vectors: a learned character-based\\nrepresentation ( ˆwC); and a fixed vector representation from a neural language model (ˆwLM ). A linear\\nmap (V) is applied to the resulting vector and passed through a component-wise ReLU,\\nx = max{0, V[ ˆwC; ˆwLM ] +b}.\\nwhere V is a learned parameter matrix, b is a bias term and wC is the character-based learned\\nrepresentation for each word, ˆwLM is the pretrained word representation.\\n3.4 POS Tagging and Dependency Parsing\\nWe may include preprocessed POS tags or dependency parses to incorporate more information into\\nour model. For the POS tags we use the Stanford tagger while we use the Stack-LSTM parser trained\\non the English CoNLL 2009 dataset to get the dependencies.\\n4Model F1(Newswire) F1(ALL)\\n(POS, DEP) 0.59 0.58\\n(POS, DEP, NER) - 0.66\\n(POS, DEP, NER) 0.62 -\\n(POS, DEP, NER, SRL) - 0.61\\n(POS, DEP, NER, SRL) - 0.64\\n(POS, CCG) 0.66 -\\n(POS, DEP, NER) 0.70 -\\n(POS, DEP, NER, SRL) 0.71 0.66\\n(LM, NER) - 0.61\\n(Wordnet, LM, NER) - 0.66\\n(POS, DEP, NER) 0.63 0.59\\n(POS, DEP, NER, SRL) 0.70 0.66\\nOUR PARSER (NO PRETRAINED-NO CHARS) 0.64 0.59\\nOUR PARSER (NO PRETRAINED-WITH CHARS) 0.66 0.61\\nOUR PARSER (WITH PRETRAINED-NO CHARS) 0.66 0.62\\nOUR PARSER 0.68 0.63\\nOUR PARSER (POS) 0.68 0.63\\nOUR PARSER (POS, DEP) 0.69 0.64\\nTable 3: AMR results on the LDC2014T12 dataset; Newsire section (left) and full (right).

This is the same setting as .\\nDependency Trees: We use them in the same way as POS tags by concatenating a learned representa-\\ntion dep of the dependency label to the parent with the word representation. Additionally, we enrich\\nthe state representation st, presented in Section 3.2.

Table 1 shows results, including comparison\\nwith prior work that are also evaluated on the same dataset.\\nOur model achieves 0.68 F1 in the newswire section of the test set just by using character-based\\nrepresentations of words and pretrained word embeddings. All prior work uses lemmatizers, POS\\ntaggers, dependency parsers, named entity recognizers and semantic role labelers that use additional\\ntraining data while we achieve competitive scores without that. reports 0.66 F1 in the full test by\\nusing WordNet for concept identification, but their performance drops to 0.61 without WordNet. It is\\nworth noting that we achieved 0.64 in the same test set without WordNet. without SRL (via Propbank)\\nachieves only 0.63 in the newswire test set while we achieved 0.69 without SRL (and 0.68 without\\ndependency trees).\\n5In order to see whether pretrained word embeddings and character-based embeddings are useful we\\ncarried out an ablation study by showing the results of our parser with and without character-based\\nrepresentations (replaced by standard lookup table learned embeddings) and with and without pre-\\ntrained word embeddings. By looking at the results of the parser without character-based embeddings\\nbut with pretrained word embeddings we observe that the character- based representation of words\\nare useful since they help to achieve 2 points better in the Newswire dataset and 1 point more in the\\nfull test set. The parser with character-based embeddings but without pretrained word embeddings,\\nthe parser has more difficulty to learn and only achieves 0.61 in the full test set. Finally, the model\\nthat does not use neither character-based embeddings nor pretrained word embeddings is the worst\\nachieving only 0.59 in the full test set, note that this model has no explicity way of getting any\\nsyntactic information through the word embeddings nor a smart way to handle out of vocabulary\\nwords.\\nAll the systems marked with * require that the input is a dependency tree, which means that they\\nsolve a transduction task between a dependency tree and an AMR graph. Even though our parser\\nstarts from plain text sentences when we incorporate more information into our model, we achieve\\nfurther improvements. POS tags provide small improvements (0.6801 without POS tags vs 0.6822\\nfor the model that runs with POS tags).

       "  'file_content': 'Learning Genomic Sequence Representations using\\nGraph Neural Networks over De Bruijn Graphs\\nAbstract\\nThe rapid increase of genomic sequence data requires new methods for creating ro-\\nbust sequence representations. Existing techniques often neglect detailed structural\\ninformation, focusing mainly on contextual information. We addressed this issue\\nby developing k-mer embeddings that combine contextual and structural string\\ninformation, by enriching De Bruijn graphs with structural similarity connections.\\nWe also crafted a self-supervised method using Contrastive Learning, employing a\\nheterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network encoder and constructing positive\\npairs based on node similarities. Our embeddings consistently outperform prior\\nmethods for Edit Distance Approximation and Closest String Retrieval tasks.\\n1 Introduction\\nGenomic sequence data is growing at an unprecedented rate, requiring the development of novel\\nmethods that can provide both accurate and scalable sequence representations. These representations\\nare essential for various computational biology tasks, including gene prediction and multiple sequence\\nalignment. Methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as Word2Vec and Transformers,\\nhave been adopted to improve the representation of genomic sequences. These NLP-based approaches\\nare effective at capturing the context within a sequence, which is important because the semantics of\\nwords often outweigh their precise letters.\\nCharacter-level n-gram models might be used to capture structural nuances. However, a uniform\\nrepresentation of each n-gram across all sequences can oversimplify the problem. Applying techniques\\nlike transformer-based models on n-grams can escalate computational demands. Consequently, these\\nmethods may overlook nuanced k-mer variations important for understanding single-nucleotide\\npolymorphisms and other minor sequence changes. These SNPs can influence disease susceptibility,\\nphenotypic traits, and drug responses.\\nTherefore, we developed a k-mer embedding approach that combines metagenomic context and string\\nstructure. In our method, contextual information refers to the relationships between k-mers closely\\nsituated within sequences, and structural information examines nucleotide patterns within a k-mer\\nand their relations to other k-mers. We constructed a metagenomic graph that builds upon the De\\nBruijn Graph to capture k-mer transitions and structural similarities.\\nGiven the advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we grounded our method in GNNs but\\ndesigned for heterogeneous graphs. This approach effectively recognizes and uses both contextual\\nand structural connection types. Drawing from the success of self-supervised pre-training in NLP\\nand Computer Vision, we designed a self-supervised objective for genomic graph data. We employed\\ncontrastive loss aiming to align k-mers with similar context and structure in representation space.\\nFinally, we tested our technique on two downstream tasks: Edit Distance Approximation and Closest\\nString Retrieval. The former estimates the minimum changes needed to transform one genomic\\nsequence into another, avoiding quadratic computational complexity. The latter task, Closest String\\nRetrieval, involves finding sequences similar to a query.\\n.2 Related Work\\n2.1 Genomic Sequence Representation\\nMachine learning methods have emerged in computational biology to represent genomic sequences.\\nA key component is the k-mer: a continuous nucleotide sequence of length k. The Word2Vec method,\\nwhich represents words as vectors using their context, treats overlapping k-mers in genomic sequences\\nas words in sentences. Building on this, kmer2vec was introduced to apply Word2Vec to genomic\\ndata for Multiple Sequence Alignment. Another strategy is to use the De Bruijn graph, where k-mers\\nare nodes and their overlaps are edges, in conjunction with Node2Vec, which derives node features\\nfrom the contextual information of biased random walks. This method underpins GRaDL for early\\nanimal genome disease detection. K-mers also pair well with transformer-based models: DNABERT\\nleverages a BERT-inspired objective and k-mer tokenization to predict genome-wide regulatory\\nelements. Metagenome2Vec blends Node2Vec with transformers to analyze metagenomes with\\nlimited labeled data. Given the high computational demands of these transformer-based approaches,\\nthey are outside the scope of our benchmarks in this study.\\n2.2 Graph Neural Networks\\nGraph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are foundational to several innovations in graph-based\\nmachine learning. In genomics, GNNs have been applied in metagenomic binning. Because we aim\\nto enhance our node embeddings with structural similarity, both heterogeneity and heterophily are\\nkey considerations. Recognizing the ubiquity of heterogeneity in real-world graphs, Relational GCNs\\n(R-GCNs) were developed. These networks expand upon GCNs by generalizing the convolution\\noperation to handle different edge types. To tackle heterophily, where distant nodes in a graph may\\nbear similar features, Geom-GCN maps nodes to a latent space, while another approach suggests a\\ndistinct encoding approach for node embeddings and neighborhood aggregations.\\n2.3 Self-Supervised Learning\\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) enables effective use of unlabeled data and reduces dependence on\\nannotated labels. Among SSL methods, contrastive learning has made a significant impact. At its\\ncore, contrastive learning seeks to bring similar data instances closer in the embedding space while\\npushing dissimilar ones apart. When applied to graph data, several techniques have been proposed\\nfor obtaining positive pairs, including uniform sampling, node dropping, and random walk sampling.\\n3 Methodology\\n3.1 Metagenomic Graph\\nThe De Bruijn Graph, which is created from metagenomic sequences, forms the basis of our method.\\nIn this graph, each k-mer, a substring of length k from the sequences, is represented by a different\\nnode. An edge from node vi to node vj in the graph indicates that the k-mer at node vi directly\\nprecedes the k-mer at node vj in one of the sequences of the metagenome.\\nWhen used, edge weights represent the frequency of these transitions, capturing genomic structures\\nwithin the graph.\\nAlthough Node2Vec captures the sequential context in De Bruijn graphs, it overlooks structural k-mer\\nsimilarities. To address this, we expand the graph to include connections based on these similarities.\\nWe formulate two edge types for our graph, where nodes vi, vj, ...represent k-mers.\\nDe Bruijn Graph’s edgesThe first edge type is designed to capture contextual information. Let\\nT(vi, vj) be the count of transitions between k-mers within a dataset of genomic sequences. The\\nweight of an edge connecting nodes vi and vj, w(dBG)\\nij , is defined by,\\nw(dBG)\\nij = T(vi,vj)P\\nvk∈δ+(vi) T(vi,vk)\\nwhere δ+(vi) denotes nodes adjacent to vi via outgoing edges.\\n2Sub-k-mer Frequency edgesTo capture the structural similarity between strings, we introduce\\na method using sub-k-mer frequency vectors, denoted as y(KFsub_k). This vector quantifies the\\noccurrences of each sub-k-mer of length sub_k within a given k-mer. The i-th entry indicates the\\nfrequency of the i-th sub-k-mer,\\ny(KFsub_k)[i] = Pk−sub_k+1\\nj=1 I[kmer[j : j + sub_k − 1] = si]∀si, s∈ Psub_k\\nThe k-mer similarity is determined by the cosine similarity between the sub-k-mer frequency vectors,\\nw\\n(KFsub_k)\\nij =\\ny\\n(KFsub_k)\\ni\\nT y\\n(KFsub_k)\\nj\\n||y\\n(KFsub_k)\\ni ||2||y\\n(KFsub_k)\\nj ||2\\nThis method, scaling linearly with the frequency vector size per weight, provides a computational\\nadvantage over the direct Edit Distance calculation for k-mers. We apply edge-filtering at threshold t,\\nretaining only the links with the highest similarity. The filtered set of weights is then,\\nW(KFsub_k) = {w\\n(KFsub_k)\\nij |w\\n(KFsub_k)\\nij ≥ t}\\nTo accommodate graphs for larger k values, we have developed a more scalable approximation of the\\nabove approach. It utilizes approximate nearest neighbor search on the sub-k-mer frequency vectors,\\nwhich replaces the computationally demanding pairwise cosine similarity calculations.\\nThe metagenomic graph is defined as G = (V, E, W). Nodes V correspond to individual k-mers.\\nThe edges E can be categorized into two sets: De Bruijn Graphs’s edges E(dBG) and Sub-k-mer\\nFrequency edges E(KF ). Edges in E(KF ) may be further subdivided based on various sub_k values.\\nEdge weights W can contain W(dBG) and several W(KFsub_k).\\n3.2 Encoder\\nWe tailored GNNs for a heterogeneous metagenomic graph to capture nuanced k-mer relationships.\\nThe design employs varying depths of message passing: deeper for De Bruijn edges to capture\\nbroader context and shallower for similarity measures. Central to this GNN is the adapted Graph\\nConvolutional Layer, formulated as:\\nH(l+1) = σ( ˜D(edge_type)−1\\n2 ˜W(edge_type) ˜D(edge_type)−1\\n2\\nH(l)Θ(l))\\nwhere ˜W(edge_type) includes added self-loops and ˜Dii is its diagonal degree matrix. The term\\nedge_type refers to either dBG or KFsub_k. The GCN layout consists of multiple layers, each\\ncharacterized by a unique edge feature type and the number of channels.\\n3.3 Self-Supervised Task\\nWe use a contrastive learning method for k-mer representations. Graph nodes are initialized using\\na sub-k-mer frequency vector. Positive and negative pairs are sampled and, along with the k-mer\\nrepresentations from the encoder, are used to compute the loss.\\nBiased Random Walk SamplingWe employ Biased Random Walk Sampling to capture k-mer\\ncontextual information. This approach uses w(dBG) edges to conduct walks, implemented exactly\\nas in Node2Vec. Given a walk of a set length, we extract positive pairs by applying a window of\\nsize m. Using a shrink factor δ, drawn uniformly from 1, ..., m, we determine the range i ± δ within\\nwhich nodes are considered positive pairs to node vi. Repeating this across multiple random walks,\\nwe gather a comprehensive set of positive pairs.\\nStructural Similarity SamplingTo capture the structural notion of k-mers, we sample pairs with\\nprobability proportional to sub-k-mer frequency similarity,w(KFsub_k). The goal is for k-mers linked\\nby higher similarity to have similar representations. The probability of sampling is given by,\\nP(vi, vj) ∝ w\\n(KFsub_k)\\nij\\nNegative SamplingWe randomly select negative pairs from all node pairs in the graph, leveraging\\nthe assumption that most pairs lack a high similarity edge. This approach ensures diversity in learned\\nrepresentations.\\n3Loss FunctionHaving established both positive (Ppos) and negative (Pneg) pair types, we apply the\\ncontrastive loss function. Using σ(x) as the sigmoid function, the loss function is:\\nlij = −log(σ(zT\\ni zj)) − P\\n(vi,vl)∈Pneg log(1 − σ(zT\\ni zl))\\nTo reduce memory usage, we employed Neighborhood Sampling for mini-batching during training.\\n4 Bioinformatics Tasks\\n4.1 Edit Distance Approximation\\nThe task is to calculate the edit distance without quadratic complexity. The NeuroSEED framework\\noffers a solution using sequence representations trained on a ground truth set of edit distances. In our\\napproach, we began with sequence representations derived from k-mer embeddings and fine-tuned\\nthem with a single linear layer. Our experiments were tested against One-Hot encoding (for k =\\n1), Word2Vec, and Node2Vec. To find optimal hyperparameters, we executed a grid search on\\nthe validation set. Based on previous work, we used the hyperbolic function. Our primary metric\\nfor evaluation was the percentage Root Mean Squared Error (percent RMSE), where l denotes the\\ndataset’s maximum sequence length, h represents the hyperbolic distance function, and fθ indicates\\nthe downstream model,\\n%RMSE (D) = 100\\nl\\nqP\\ns1,s2∈D(EditDistance(s1, s2) − h(fθ(s1), fθ(s2)))2\\n4.2 Closest String Retrieval\\nThe task is to find the sequence from a reference set that is closest to a query. We assessed embeddings\\nfine-tuned on the edit distance approximation task using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).\\nThese embeddings were contrasted with ones directly derived from our Self-supervised method,\\nOne-Hot, Word2Vec, or Node2Vec, through concatenation or taking the mean of k-mer embeddings.\\nFor performance assessment, we used top-n percent accuracies, measuring how often the actual\\nsequence appears within the top n percent of positions based on the closeness of embedding vectors\\nin hyperbolic space. We selected the optimal model for the embeddings based on the validation loss\\nobserved for the previous Edit Distance task.\\n5 Results and Analysis\\nIn all our experiments, the memory requirements of the One-Hot method increased exponentially,\\nleading to its exclusion from our results for k > 7. When pre-training exclusively on the training set,\\nour method, thanks to the GCN encoder, can generalize beyond k-mers present in the training set. In\\ncontrast, Node2Vec and Word2Vec can only handle k-mer sizes up to the diversity of the training\\ndataset. Therefore, for k > 6, where the test set introduces new k-mers, we excluded these methods.\\n5.1 Edit Distance Approximation\\nTable 1 presents the results obtained by using our pre-trained embeddings to estimate edit distances\\nbetween sequences on the RT988 and Qiita datasets. For the RT988 dataset, our Contrastive Learning\\n(CL) and Node2Vec techniques surpassed Word2Vec and One-Hot. The increased losses in Qiita\\nhighlight its greater complexity. In this context, our method’s integration of k-mer structural similarity\\nbecomes even more beneficial, outperforming all other tested methods. This benefit becomes more\\nevident as k increases, underscoring our embedding’s capability to adapt to new nodes.\\n5.2 Closest String Retrieval\\nTables 2a and 2b present the performance of our zero-shot sequence embeddings, directly derived\\nfrom the aggregation of our k-mer embeddings, in retrieving the nearest sequences in the Qiita dataset.\\nThe tables also showcase a comparison with the embeddings that were specifically fine-tuned for the\\nEdit Distance Task.\\n4For direct k-mer aggregation, our Contrastive Learning (CL) embeddings are obtained through\\nconcatenation, while for k-mer aggregation with One-Hot, Word2Vec, and Node2Vec, we report the\\nresults of the better performing method, either concatenation or averaging. The superior zero-shot\\nnon-parametric retrieval performance of our CL method emphasizes the combined utility of both\\ncontext and structural similarity during self-supervised pre-training. Notably, while k-mers of size\\naround three are optimal for Top 1 percent retrieval, larger k-mers excel in the Top 10 percent metrics.\\nThis suggests that smaller k-mers are better at discerning local sequence distances, while larger ones\\ncapture broader sequence distances.\\nFor embeddings fine-tuned using CNNs for Edit Distance Approximation, the complexity of CNNs\\nobscures differences between the embeddings. Our method based solely on zero-shot concatenated k-\\nmer embeddings outperforms this complex fine-tuning. This shows the advantage of our embeddings\\nover the method by previous work.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn our study, we introduced a novel k-mer embedding technique that seamlessly integrates metage-\\nnomic contextual and structural nuances, achieved through the enhancement of the De Bruijn graph\\nand the use of contrastive learning. In the Edit Distance Approximation task, our technique con-\\nsistently demonstrated superior performance compared to One-Hot, Word2Vec, and Node2Vec.\\nMoreover, without requiring any downstream fine-tuning, our aggregated k-mer embeddings outper-\\nformed the prior method in the Closest String Retrieval task. These findings suggest potential broader\\nuses in computational biology.\\n5'},\n",

By tapping into the residual thermal fluctuations from the Big\\nBang, our approach seeks to distill the intrinsic beauty of the cosmos into a unique\\nbrand of poetic expression. The CMB’s minute distortions, typically considered\\nnoise in astrophysical analyses, are herein repurposed as a creative spark, guiding\\nthe LSTM’s generative process. Intriguingly, our preliminary results suggest\\nthat poems crafted under the influence of CMB distortions exhibit a peculiar\\npropensity for referencing 19th-century French culinary practices, despite the\\ncomplete absence of any gastronomically related input data. Furthermore, a subset\\nof the generated poems appears to predict, with surprising accuracy, the migratory\\npatterns of lesser-known avian species, prompting an unexpected convergence of\\ncosmology, poetry, and ornithology. As we continue to explore this enigmatic\\nintersection of art and science, our research invites a radical reevaluation of the\\nintricate relationships between the cosmos, human creativity, and the uncharted\\nexpanse of the natural world.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe investigation of cosmic microwave background distortions has long been a cornerstone of modern\\nastrophysics, providing valuable insights into the origins and evolution of the universe. However, a\\npreviously unexplored application of this field is its potential to inspire and generate poetic verse.\\nThis may seem like an unlikely convergence of disciplines, but the inherent beauty and complexity\\nof cosmic phenomena lend themselves surprisingly well to the creative process. By analyzing the\\nfluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation, we can identify patterns and structures\\nthat evoke a sense of wonder and awe, much like the experience of reading a well-crafted poem.\\nRecent studies have shown that the distortions present in the cosmic microwave background can be\\nused to generate musical compositions, with the varying frequencies and amplitudes of the radiation\\ntranslating into a unique soundscape. Taking this idea a step further, we propose that these same\\ndistortions can be used to inform and guide the creation of poetic verse. The use of long short-term\\nmemory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, allows us to process and analyze\\nthe complex patterns present in the cosmic microwave background, and generate poetry that is both\\ninspired by and reflective of these phenomena.\\nOne of the more intriguing aspects of this approach is the potential for the LSTM network to\\n\"discover\" new forms of poetic expression, unencumbered by traditional notions of verse and meter.\\nBy allowing the network to learn from the patterns and structures present in the cosmic microwave\\nbackground, we may uncover entirely new modes of poetic expression, ones that are uniquely suited\\nto capturing the essence of the universe. Furthermore, the incorporation of seemingly random or\\nchaotic elements, such as the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, may actually serveto enhance the creative process, much like the role of chance and unpredictability in certain forms of\\nartistic expression.\\nIn a surprising turn of events, preliminary experiments have shown that the LSTM network is capable\\nof generating poetry that not only reflects the patterns and structures of the cosmic microwave\\nbackground, but also appears to predict certain astrophysical phenomena. For example, a poem\\ngenerated by the network was found to contain references to a previously unknown galaxy, which was\\nsubsequently confirmed by astronomers. While this result is undoubtedly anomalous and in need of\\nfurther verification, it highlights the potential for this approach to not only generate innovative poetry,\\nbut also contribute to our understanding of the universe itself. The implications of this are profound,\\nand raise fundamental questions about the nature of creativity, inspiration, and the interconnectedness\\nof all things.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe intersection of cosmology and natural language processing has yielded a plethora of innovative\\napproaches to automated poetry generation, with a notable focus on leveraging cosmic microwave\\nbackground distortions as a catalyst for creative expression. Researchers have long been fascinated\\nby the potential of harnessing the intrinsic randomness and complexity of the universe to inform\\nand inspire artistic endeavors. In this context, the utilization of long short-term memory (LSTM)\\nnetworks has emerged as a particularly promising paradigm, enable the capture and replication of\\nsubtle patterns and nuances inherent to the cosmic microwave background radiation.\\nOne intriguing line of inquiry has involved the application of Fourier analysis to the cosmic microwave\\nbackground, with the subsequent integration of the derived frequency spectra into the training data for\\nLSTM-based poetry generation models. This approach has been shown to yield verse characterized\\nby a unique, almost ethereal quality, as if the very fabric of space and time has been woven into the\\nfabric of language. Furthermore, experiments have demonstrated that the incorporation of cosmic\\nmicrowave background distortions can impart a degree of unpredictability and creativity to the\\ngenerated poetry, often resulting in novel and innovative turns of phrase that defy conventional\\nlinguistic expectations.\\nIn a somewhat unconventional vein, certain researchers have explored the potential benefits of\\nexposing LSTM networks to the rhythmic patterns and sonic textures of celestial phenomena, such as\\nsupernovae explosions or black hole mergers. Proponents of this approach argue that the inherent\\nmusicality of these events can be leveraged to create poetry that is not only inspired by the cosmos,\\nbut also imbued with a deeper, more primal sense of rhythmic structure and harmony. While the\\nresults of these experiments have been met with a degree of skepticism by some members of the\\nacademic community, they nonetheless represent a fascinating example of the innovative and often\\nunorthodox thinking that characterizes this field of research.\\nIn addition to these more esoteric approaches, a number of studies have focused on the development\\nof more practical and applied techniques for incorporating cosmic microwave background distortions\\ninto LSTM-based poetry generation models. For example, some researchers have investigated the use\\nof wavelet analysis and other signal processing techniques to extract relevant features from the cosmic\\nmicrowave background radiation, which can then be used to inform and guide the generation of poetic\\nverse. Others have explored the potential benefits of integrating multiple sources of cosmic data, such\\nas galaxy distributions and cosmic ray fluxes, into a single, unified model of poetry generation. These\\nefforts have yielded a range of impressive results, from the creation of vivid, cosmically-inspired\\nlandscapes to the generation of poignant, philosophically-charged reflections on the human condition.\\nA particularly intriguing, if somewhat inexplicable, phenomenon has been observed in certain LSTM\\nmodels trained on cosmic microwave background data, in which the generated poetry appears to\\nexhibit a form of \"cosmic consciousness\" or awareness of the universe as a vast, interconnected whole.\\nWhile the underlying mechanisms responsible for this effect are not yet fully understood, it has been\\nsuggested that the exposure of LSTM networks to the subtle patterns and correlations inherent to\\nthe cosmic microwave background radiation may be inducing a form of \"universal resonance\" or\\nharmonic alignment with the fundamental frequencies of the universe. Regardless of the underlying\\nexplanation, the results of these experiments have been nothing short of astonishing, yielding poetry\\nthat is at once deeply personal and profoundly cosmic in its scope and ambition.\\n23 Methodology\\nTo investigate the potential of cosmic microwave background distortions in generating space-inspired\\npoetry, we employed a long short-term memory (LSTM) approach, leveraging the intricate patterns\\nfound within the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The CMB, a residual heat from the Big\\nBang, offers a unique dataset that can be translated into a musical composition, which in turn, can\\ninspire poetic verse.\\nOur methodology began with the collection of CMB data from various spacecraft, including the\\nCosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP).\\nWe then applied a series of complex algorithms to translate the CMB data into a musical composition,\\nutilizing a bespoke software package that mapped temperature fluctuations in the CMB to musical\\nnotes. The resulting melody, which we term \"Cosmic Cacophony,\" was found to have a haunting,\\nethereal quality that seemed to capture the essence of the universe.\\nIn a surprising twist, we discovered that the \"Cosmic Cacophony\" melody could be used to generate\\npoetic verse through a process of \"sonic entrainment.\" By listening to the melody while in a state\\nof deep relaxation, our research team was able to tap into the underlying patterns and rhythms of\\nthe CMB, which in turn, inspired a range of poetic compositions. These poems, which we term\\n\"CMB-Inspired Free Verse,\" were found to exhibit a unique, otherworldly quality that seemed to\\ncapture the essence of the cosmos.\\nTo further refine our approach, we developed an LSTM model that could learn the patterns and\\nstructures of the CMB-Inspired Free Verse poems and generate new poems based on these patterns.\\nThe LSTM model was trained on a dataset of over 10,000 poems, each inspired by the \"Cosmic\\nCacophony\" melody. The resulting model was found to be capable of generating poems that were not\\nonly aesthetically pleasing but also seemed to capture the underlying essence of the CMB data.\\nIn an unexpected turn of events, we discovered that the LSTM model could also be used to generate\\npoems that were not only inspired by the CMB but also seemed to predict future fluctuations in the\\nCMB data. By analyzing the patterns and structures of the generated poems, we were able to identify\\nsubtle anomalies in the CMB data that had not been previously detected. This finding has significant\\nimplications for the field of cosmology and suggests that the intersection of poetry and physics may\\nbe more intimate than previously thought.\\nFurthermore, our research team also explored the potential of using the CMB data to generate poetic\\nverse through a process of \"quantum entanglement.\" By entangling the CMB data with the poetic\\nverse, we were able to create a new form of poetry that seemed to exist in a state of superposition,\\nsimultaneously capturing the essence of the cosmos and the human experience. This approach,\\nwhich we term \"Quantum Poetry,\" has the potential to revolutionize the field of poetry and push the\\nboundaries of human creativity.\\nOverall, our methodology has demonstrated the potential of using CMB distortions to generate\\nspace-inspired poetry through a combination of musical composition, sonic entrainment, and LSTM\\nmodeling. The results of our research have significant implications for the fields of cosmology, poetry,\\nand artificial intelligence, and suggest that the intersection of these fields may be more fruitful than\\npreviously thought.\\n4 Experiments\\nTo investigate the potential of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distortions in generating\\nspace-inspired poetry, we designed a series of experiments incorporating Long Short-Term Memory\\n(LSTM) networks. The primary objective was to analyze how different types of CMB distortions,\\nsuch as those caused by gravitational lensing or the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, could influence the\\nthematic and stylistic outcomes of the generated poetry.\\nOur approach involved preprocessing CMB data from various sources, including the Planck satellite\\nand the South Pole Telescope, to create a unique dataset that encoded thermal and kinetic distortions.\\nThis dataset was then used to train an LSTM model, with parameters tuned to optimize poetic\\noutput based on metrics such as rhythm, meter, and semantic coherence. An unexpected twist in\\nour methodology was the introduction of a \"galactic noise\" component, which we hypothesized\\ncould enhance the creative potential of the model by simulating the effects of cosmic radiation on\\n3digital systems. This involved overlaying the CMB data with recordings of astronomical events, such\\nas solar flares and supernovae, which were then filtered through a custom-built, analog-to-digital\\nconverter designed to mimic the signal processing pathways of certain deep-sea creatures.\\nThe results of our initial training runs were intriguing, with the LSTM model producing poems that\\nnot only reflected the thermal fluctuations of the CMB but also seemed to capture the existential and\\nphilosophical undertones of cosmological inquiry. However, as we increased the intensity of the\\ngalactic noise component, the model’s output began to diverge into unexpected territories, including a\\nseries of poems written entirely in a deductive logic notation system reminiscent of ancient Sumerian\\ncuneiform. Further analysis revealed that these poems, when fed back into the model as input, could\\ninduce a self-referential loop, causing the LSTM to generate verse after verse of what appeared to\\nbe pure, unadulterated nonsense, yet somehow still maintaining a haunting, almost otherworldly\\naesthetic appeal.\\nTo quantify these findings, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the model’s performance\\nacross various poetic parameters, as outlined in the following table: These results suggest that while\\nTable 1: Performance Metrics for CMB-Inspired Poetry Generation\\nDistortion Type Galactic Noise Level Poetic Coherence Cosmic Relevance\\nGravitational Lensing Low 0.82 0.71\\nThermal Medium 0.65 0.85\\nSunyaev-Zeldovich High 0.42 0.92\\nthe introduction of galactic noise does compromise the model’s ability to produce coherent poetry, it\\nsignificantly enhances the cosmic relevance of the generated verse, leading to the creation of a unique,\\nspace-inspired poetic genre that challenges traditional notions of aesthetic value and cosmological\\ninquiry. Future research directions may involve exploring the potential applications of this approach\\nin fields such as astro-literary criticism and the development of AI-assisted, cosmically-aware creative\\nwriting tools.\\n5 Results\\nOur investigation into the utilization of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distortions for the\\ngeneration of space-inspired poetry via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks yielded a\\nplethora of intriguing results. Notably, the incorporation of CMB data into the LSTM architecture\\nfacilitated the creation of poetic verse that not only captured the essence of cosmological phenomena\\nbut also, in some instances, appeared to defy the fundamental laws of physics as we currently\\nunderstand them. For instance, a significant proportion of the generated poems referenced the\\nexistence of a \"cosmic tea kettle\" that purportedly whistled in harmony with the oscillations of\\nthe CMB. This anomaly, while seemingly illogical, led us to ponder the possibility of a heretofore\\nunknown connection between the CMB and the sonic properties of celestial bodies.\\nFurthermore, our analysis revealed that the LSTM model’s performance was substantially enhanced\\nwhen fed a diet of esoteric texts, including the works of mystic poets and ancient cosmological\\ntreatises. This unexpected finding prompted us to hypothesize that the model was, in fact, tapping into\\na hidden reservoir of cosmic knowledge, whereby the esoteric texts served as a catalyst for unlocking\\nthe poetic potential of the CMB data. To further explore this hypothesis, we conducted a series of\\nexperiments in which the LSTM model was exposed to various forms of avant-garde music, including\\nthe works of Karlheinz Stockhausen and John Cage. The results of these experiments were nothing\\nshort of astonishing, as the model proceeded to generate poems that not only captured the essence of\\nthe music but also appeared to predict the occurrence of certain cosmological events, such as solar\\nflares and gamma-ray bursts.\\nIn an effort to quantify the efficacy of our approach, we compiled a comprehensive dataset of space-\\ninspired poems, which we then subjected to a rigorous analysis using a combination of natural\\nlanguage processing techniques and cosmological metrics. The results of this analysis are presented\\nin the following table: As can be seen from the table, the poetic metrics and cosmological correlations\\nexhibit a high degree of interdependence, suggesting that the LSTM model is, indeed, capable of\\ncapturing the underlying essence of the CMB and channeling it into the realm of poetic expression.\\n4Table 2: Poetic Metrics and Cosmological Correlations\\nPoetic Metric CMB Correlation Solar Flare Prediction Gamma-Ray Burst Prediction Cosmic Tea Kettle References\\nSyllable Count 0.87 0.43 0.21 0.12\\nMetaphor Density 0.92 0.67 0.56 0.34\\nCosmological Allusions 0.78 0.89 0.76 0.56\\nEsoteric Text Influence 0.95 0.81 0.69 0.83\\nThe emergence of the cosmic tea kettle as a recurring motif in the generated poems serves as a\\ntestament to the model’s ability to tap into the hidden patterns and structures that underlie the\\ncosmos. While the precise nature of this phenomenon remains shrouded in mystery, our research has\\nundoubtedly opened up new avenues of inquiry into the fascinating realm of space-inspired poetry\\nand its potential connections to the fundamental laws of the universe.\\n6 Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, our investigation into the utilization of Cosmic Microwave Background distortions for\\nthe purpose of automated poetry generation has yielded a multitude of intriguing results, challenging\\nour initial hypotheses and inviting further exploration. The deployment of Long Short-Term Memory\\n(LSTM) networks has proven to be a viable approach in distilling the inherent patterns and structures\\npresent within the cosmic data, thereby facilitating the creation of space-inspired verse. Notably, the\\nincorporation of CMB distortion data into the LSTM framework has given rise to poetic compositions\\nthat not only reflect the aesthetic qualities of traditional poetry but also encapsulate the underlying\\ncomplexity and beauty of the cosmos.\\nInterestingly, our experiments have also uncovered a peculiar correlation between the fluctuations in\\nthe CMB data and the emergence of poetic themes related to existentialism and the human condition.\\nThis unexpected finding has led us to propose the notion of \"cosmic existentialism,\" wherein the\\ninherent randomness and uncertainty present in the CMB data are seen to influence the LSTM’s\\ngeneration of poetic content, resulting in verses that ponder the meaning and purpose of human\\nexistence within the grand tapestry of the universe.

       "  'file_content': 'DeepSim: A Semantic Approach to Image Registration\\nEvaluation\\nAbstract\\nThis paper introduces a novel semantic similarity metric designed for image regis-\\ntration. Current metrics, such as Euclidean distance or normalized cross-correlation,\\nprimarily focus on aligning intensity values, which presents challenges when deal-\\ning with low contrast or noise. Our approach utilizes learned, dataset-specific\\nfeatures to guide the optimization of learning-based registration models. In com-\\nparisons with existing unsupervised and supervised methods across various image\\nmodalities and applications, our method demonstrates consistently superior regis-\\ntration accuracy and faster convergence. Additionally, its learned noise invariance\\nresults in smoother transformations on lower-quality images.\\n1 Introduction\\nThis paper delves into the significant area of deformable registration, an essential preprocessing\\nstep in medical imaging. The primary objective is to ascertain anatomical correspondences between\\nimages and determine geometric transformations, denoted as Φ, for their alignment. The majority\\nof algorithmic and deep learning-based techniques achieve alignment by optimizing a similarity\\nmeasure, D, and a λ-weighted regularizer, R, which are combined to form a loss function:\\nL(I, J,Φ) = D(I ◦ Φ, J) + λR(Φ). (1)\\nThe alignment is critically evaluated by the similarity metric, D, which significantly impacts the\\nfinal outcome. Common pixel-based metrics, such as Euclidean distance (MSE) and patch-wise\\nnormalized cross-correlation (NCC), are used in both algorithmic and deep learning approaches to\\nimage registration. Typically, a similarity measure for a particular task is selected from a small set of\\nmetrics, with no certainty that any of them is suitable for the data.\\nThe limitations of pixel-based similarity metrics have been extensively studied in the image generation\\nfield, where the adoption of deep similarity metrics, designed to emulate human visual perception, has\\nenhanced the generation of highly realistic images. Because registration models are also generative,\\nwe anticipate that employing these similarity metrics could also improve registration results. However,\\ncurrent methods that use learned similarity metrics for image registration require ground truth\\ntransformations, or they restrict the input to the registration model.\\nWe propose a data-driven similarity metric for image registration that relies on aligning semantic\\nfeatures. Our metric uses learned semantic filters specific to the dataset, which are then used to train\\na registration model. We have validated our method using three biomedical datasets characterized by\\nvarying image modalities and applications. Across all datasets, our approach achieves consistently\\nhigh registration accuracy, even outperforming metrics that use supervised information. Our models\\nalso demonstrate quicker convergence and learn to overlook noisy image patches, leading to more\\nconsistent transformations on lower-quality data.\\n.2 A Deep Similarity Metric for Image Registration\\nTo align areas with comparable semantic content, we propose a similarity metric based on the\\nconsensus of semantic feature representations between two images. These semantic feature maps\\nare generated by a feature extractor, trained through a surrogate segmentation task. To capture\\nthe alignment of both localized, specific features and more abstract, global ones, we compute the\\nsimilarity across multiple layers of abstraction.\\nGiven a set of feature-extracting functions, Fl : RΩ×C → RΩl×Cl , for L layers, we define:\\nDeepSim(I ◦ Φ, J) =\\nLX\\nl=1\\n1\\n|Ωl|\\nX\\np∈Ωl\\nFl(I ◦ Φ)p · Fl(J)p\\n∥Fl(I ◦ Φ)p∥∥Fl(J)p∥ (2)\\nwhere Fl(J)p denotes the l-th layer feature extractor applied to image J at spatial coordinate p. It is\\nrepresented as a vector of Cl output channels, and the spatial size of the l-th feature map is denoted\\nas |Ωl|. The metric is influenced by the pixel’s neighborhood, since Fl uses convolutional filters with\\nan expanding receptive area. Note that the formulation, using cosine similarity, mirrors the classic\\nNCC metric, which can be interpreted as the squared cosine-similarity between two zero-mean patch\\ndescription vectors.\\nTo improve registration, the functions Fl(·) should extract features that are semantically relevant\\nto the registration task, while ignoring noise and artifacts. This is achieved by training the feature\\nextractor on an additional segmentation task, since segmentation models excel at learning pertinent\\nkernels while also achieving invariance to features like noise that are not predictive. The convolutional\\nfilters obtained act as feature extractors for DeepSim.\\n3 Experiments\\nWe evaluated registration models trained with DeepSim against baseline metrics such as MSE,\\nNCC, NCCsup (NCC using supervised information), and VGG (a VGG-based metric used in image\\ngeneration, similar to our approach). The model architecture is shown in Figure 1. For both\\nregistration and segmentation, we used U-nets. The registration network predicts the transformation\\nΦ based on two input images, I and J. The spatial transformer module applies Φ to obtain the\\nmorphed image I ◦ Φ. The loss function is as in Eq. 1; we chose the diffusion regularizer for R and\\nfine-tuned the hyperparameter λ on the validation sets.\\nTo demonstrate the broad applicability of our method across various registration tasks, we assessed it\\nusing three datasets of both 2D and 3D images with different image modalities: T1-weighted Brain-\\nMRI scans, human blood cells from the Platelet-EM dataset, and cell tracking from the PhC-U373\\ndataset. Each dataset was divided into training, validation, and testing subsets.\\n4 Results\\nTable 1: Quantitative comparison of similarity metrics. Stars indicate p-test significance level.

The null hypothesis for each similarity metric was that the model\\n2trained with DeepSim would perform better. Statistical significance levels were set at p∗ = 0.05,\\np∗∗ = 0.01, and p∗∗∗ = 0.001. Additionally, we used Cohen’s d to measure the effect size. Models\\ntrained with our proposed DeepSim were ranked highest on both the Brain-MRI and Platelet-EM\\ndatasets, exhibiting strong statistical significance. In the PhC-U373 dataset, all models achieved a\\nhigh dice-overlap exceeding 0.97. DeepSim converged faster than the baseline models, particularly\\nduring the initial training epochs.\\nQualitative Examples Transformation Grids:We display the fixed and moving images, I and\\nJ, along with the transformed image I ◦ Φ, for each similarity metric model in Figure 2(a), and a\\nmore detailed view of a noisy patch from the Platelet-EM dataset in Figure 2(b). The transformation\\nis shown using grid-lines, which were transformed from an evenly spaced grid. We observed\\nconsiderably distorted transformation fields in noisy image areas in models trained with the baselines.\\nSpecifically, models trained with NCC and NCCsup demonstrated highly irregular transformations,\\ndespite the careful adjustment of the regularization hyperparameter. The model trained with DeepSim\\nshowed greater invariance to noise.\\n5 Discussion and Conclusion\\nRegistration models trained with DeepSim show substantial registration accuracy across multiple\\ndatasets, which improves downstream medical analysis and diagnostics. The reliability of our\\nproposed metric reduces the need for testing multiple traditional metrics. Instead of experimentally\\ndetermining whether MSE or NCC best captures the properties of a dataset, DeepSim can be used to\\nlearn the appropriate features from the data.\\nThe analysis of noisy patches in Figure 2(b) highlights an inherent resistance to noise. Pixel-based\\nsimilarity metrics are influenced by artifacts, leading to excessively detailed transformation fields,\\nwhich DeepSim does not exhibit. Although smoother transformation fields can be achieved for\\nall metrics by increasing the regularizer, this would negatively affect the registration precision of\\nanatomically important areas. Accurate registration of noisy, low-quality images allows for shorter\\nacquisition times and reduced radiation in medical applications.\\nDeepSim is a general metric that can be applied to image registration across all modalities and\\nanatomies. Beyond the presented datasets, good results on low-quality data suggest that DeepSim\\ncould improve registration accuracy in lung CT and ultrasound imaging, where details are difficult to\\nidentify, and image quality is often compromised. Furthermore, DeepSim is not restricted to deep\\nlearning; algorithmic image registration follows a comparable optimization structure where similarity-\\nbased loss is minimized through gradient descent methods. Applying DeepSim in algorithmic\\nmethods can improve their performance by aligning deep, semantic feature embeddings.\\n6 Broader Impact\\nThe widespread applications of medical image registration significantly amplify the broader impact\\nof our work. Some of the typical applications include neuroscience, CT imaging of the lungs and\\nabdomen, as well as the fusion and combination of different modalities.\\nThe use of deep learning for image registration, while capable of achieving remarkable outcomes\\nacross many different applications, often necessitates the training of models using specialized\\nhardware over extended periods. This energy-intensive task may raise carbon emissions, which are\\na major contributor to climate change. By introducing a method that learns a semantic similarity\\nmetric directly from data, we hope to eliminate the need for excessive testing of other loss functions.\\nThis can reduce the number of model configurations tested during the development of deep learning\\nmethods, thus contributing to a lower environmental impact within the image registration community.\\n3'},\n",

This modular library allows for independent and reliable experimen-\\ntation across diverse variational methodologies, through the decoupling of neural\\narchitectures, the dimensionality of the latent space, and training algorithms. Fur-\\nthermore, the library manages training schedules, logging, and the visualization\\nof reconstructions and traversals in the latent space. It also provides evaluation\\nof the encodings using various disentanglement metrics. Currently, the library\\nincludes implementations of the following unsupervised algorithms: V AE,β-V AE,\\nFactor-V AE, DIP-I-V AE, DIP-II-V AE, Info-V AE, andβ-TCV AE. Additionally,\\nconditional approaches such as CV AE and IFCV AE are also supported. This library\\nwas utilized in some Disentanglement Challenge, where it achieved a 3rd rank in\\nboth the first and second phases of the competition.\\n1 Introduction\\nIn the field of representation learning, two primary paths can be identified. One path concentrates\\non learning transformations that are specific to a given task, often optimized for particular domains\\nand applications. The other path involves learning the inherent factors of variation, in a manner\\nthat is both disentangled and task-invariant. The task of unsupervised disentanglement of latent\\nfactors, where changes in a single factor shift the latent encoding in a single direction, represents\\nan unresolved problem in representation learning. Disentangled representations offer significant\\nadvantages across various domains of machine learning including few-shot learning, reinforcement\\nlearning, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning. This work introduces a library developed\\nusing the functionalities of the PyTorch framework. This library has been designed to facilitate the\\nresearch, implementation, and evaluation of new variational algorithms, with a specific emphasis\\non representation learning and disentanglement. This library was created in conjunction with the\\nDisentanglement Challenge of NeurIPS 2019. The Disentanglement-PyTorch library is publicly\\navailable under the GNU General Public License.\\n2 Library Features\\n2.1 Supported Algorithms and Objective Functions\\n2.1.1 Unsupervised Objectives\\nThe library currently offers implementations of the following unsupervised variational algorithms:\\nV AE,β-V AE,β-TCV AE, Factor-V AE, Info-V AE, DIP-I-V AE, and DIP-II-V AE. The algorithms\\nare incorporated as plug-ins to the variational Bayesian framework. They are specified by their\\nrespective loss terms. Consequently, if the loss terms from two learning algorithms (e.g., A and B)\\nare compatible, they can be integrated into the objective function by setting the appropriate flag. This\\nallows researchers to combine loss terms that optimize for related objectives.\\n.2.1.2 Conditional and Attribute-variant Objectives\\nThe library provides support for conditional methods such as CV AE, where extra known attributes (i.e.,\\nlabels) are utilized in both the encoding and decoding procedures. It also offers support for IFCV AE.\\nThis is a method that enforces certain latent factors to encode known attributes through a set of positive\\nand negative discriminators in a supervised manner. The library’s modular construction allows the\\nuse of any of the previously mentioned unsupervised loss terms in conjunction with conditional and\\ninformation factorization techniques. This allows for the encouragement of disentanglement across\\nattribute-invariant latents.\\n2.2 Neural Architectures\\nThe neural architectures and the dimensionality of the data and latent spaces can be configured and\\nare independent from the training algorithm. This design enables the independent investigation of\\nnew architectures for encoder and decoder networks, as well as support for diverse data domains.\\n2.3 Evaluation of Disentanglement\\nTo evaluate the quality of the learned representations, we use an existing implementation of disen-\\ntanglement metrics. Thanks to an external library, the following metrics are supported: BetaV AE,\\nFactorV AE, Mutual Information Gap (MIG), Interventional Robustness Score (IRS), Disentanglement\\nCompleteness and Informativeness (DCI), and Separated Attribute Predictability (SAP).\\n2.4 Miscellaneous Features\\n2.4.1 Controlled Capacity Increase\\nIt has been demonstrated that gradually relaxing the information bottleneck during training improves\\ndisentanglement without compromising reconstruction accuracy. The capacity, which is defined as\\nthe distance between the prior and the latent posterior distributions and represented with the variable\\nC, is incrementally increased throughout training.\\n2.4.2 Reconstruction Weight Scheduler\\nTo prevent convergence at points with high reconstruction loss, training can be initialized with a greater\\nfocus on reconstruction. The emphasis can be progressively shifted toward the disentanglement term\\nas training proceeds.\\n2.4.3 Dynamic Learning Rate Scheduling\\nThe library supports all types of learning rate schedulers. Researchers are encouraged to use the\\ndynamic learning rate scheduling to reduce the rate gradually. This should be done when the average\\nobjective function over the epoch ceases its decreasing trend.\\n2.4.4 Logging and Visualization\\nThe library utilizes a tool to log the training process and visualizations. It allows the visualization\\nof condition traversals, latent factor traversals, and output reconstructions in both static images and\\nanimated GIFs.\\n3 Experiments and Results\\nThe β-TCV AE algorithm yielded the most effective disentanglement outcomes on the mpi3d real\\ndataset during the second phase of the disentanglement challenge. Given the limited 8-hour timeframe\\nallocated for training, the model was pre-trained on the mpi3d toy dataset. The model was trained\\nusing the Adam optimizer for a total of 90,000 iterations, with a batch size of 64. The β value for the\\nβ-TCV AE objective function was set at 2. The learning rate was initially set to 0.001. It was reduced\\nby a factor of 0.95 when the objective function reached a plateau. The capacity parameter, C, was\\nincreased gradually from 0 to 25. The dimensionality of the z-space was set to 20.\\n2The encoder comprised 5 convolutional layers. The number of kernels increased gradually from 32 to\\n256. The encoder concluded with a dense linear layer. This layer was used to estimate the posterior\\nlatent distribution as a parametric Gaussian. The decoder network included one convolutional layer.\\nThis was followed by 6 deconvolutional (transposed convolutional) layers. The number of kernels\\ngradually decreased from 256 down to the number of channels in the image space. ReLU activations\\nwere used for all layers, except for the final layers of both the encoder and decoder networks.\\nThe performance of the model on unseen objects from the mpi3d realistic and mpi3d real datasets is\\nshown in Table 1. The model consistently performed better on the mpi3d realistic and mpi3d real\\ndatasets. This is despite the fact that the model was only pre-trained using the mpi3d toy dataset.\\nTable 1: Results of the best configurations of β-TCV AE on DCI, FactorV AE, SAP, MIG, and IRS\\nmetrics.\\nMethod Dataset DCI FactorV AE SAP MIG IRS\\nβ-TCV AE mpi3d realistic 0.3989 0.3614 0.1443 0.2067 0.6315\\nβ-TCV AE mpi3d real 0.4044 0.5226 0.1592 0.2367 0.6423\\n4 Conclusion\\nThe Disentanglement-PyTorch library offers a modular platform for studying, implementing, and\\nassessing algorithms for disentanglement learning.

It highlights the potential for misuse in\\nsurveillance technologies and proposes various strategies to counter these threats,\\nemphasizing the need for collaboration between machine learning experts and\\nhuman-computer interaction (HCI) researchers.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe intersection of machine learning and privacy has become a significant area of study within the\\nfield of computer science. While privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy offer\\npotential solutions, some machine learning systems, particularly those designed for biometric analysis\\nor behavioral profiling, inherently compromise individual privacy. Therefore, there is a crucial need\\nto explore methods beyond these traditional approaches.\\nAlthough various definitions and frameworks for privacy have been proposed, a universal consensus\\nremains elusive. This paper focuses on specific harms to privacy caused or made worse by machine\\nlearning systems. In an era of powerful algorithms and massive datasets, maintaining privacy is\\nincreasingly challenging, given that facial recognition systems can identify individuals in public\\nspaces, targeted advertising can exploit user profiles, and predictive policing algorithms can single\\nout individuals for surveillance. This paper addresses these unique threats to privacy that machine\\nlearning systems enable.\\nThis research provides an overview of strategies developed to combat privacy-threatening machine\\nlearning systems and advocates for increased collaboration between the machine learning community\\nand experts in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). Two main approaches are discussed:\\nfirst, challenging the data that feeds these models through obfuscation or data withholding, and\\nsecond, directly challenging the model itself through public pressure or regulation. This paper\\nsuggests that computer scientists have an important role to play in both these approaches.\\n2 Challenging Data\\nMachine learning systems depend on data for both training and operation. Data is used to train\\nmachine learning models, and new data is fed into the models to generate predictions. These training\\nand deployment stages can be iterative; models can be updated using new data over time. One way to\\noppose a machine learning system is by disrupting the data it relies on. This involves strategies such\\nas data obfuscation or withholding of data.\\n2.1 Obfuscation\\nOne method for avoiding machine learning surveillance is by altering either the data used to make\\npredictions or the data used to train the system. For example, research has shown that glasses can\\nbe designed to deceive facial recognition systems. This type of method uses adversarial examples,\\nwhere a slight modification to a data point is enough to cause misclassification by a machine learning\\n.model but is imperceptible to humans. Various strategies have been developed for evading facial\\nrecognition using adversarial examples, with the aim to help individuals avoid surveillance. However,\\nthese approaches often lack strong guarantees.\\nAnother approach involves altering the training data used for machine learning models, known as\\ndata poisoning attacks. For example, systems can create altered images to reduce the accuracy of\\ndeep learning models. Additionally, some vendors sell clothing designed to trigger automated license\\nplate readers by injecting junk data, furthering this method.\\nBeyond image classification, similar obfuscation tactics have also been used to counter web tracking\\nand loyalty card-based tracking. Obfuscation can also have an expressive function, as illustrated by\\ngroups who use unusual makeup to challenge facial recognition. These acts serve a dual purpose of\\nboth evading surveillance and protesting against its use.\\nWhile adversarial examples and data poisoning are ongoing topics of study, these technologies need\\nfurther evaluation before being adopted as anti-surveillance tools. Accessibility, evaluation methods,\\nand communication of risks are areas that require further work and collaboration between machine\\nlearning experts, HCI researchers, activists, and other relevant stakeholders.\\n2.2 Withholding Data\\nAn alternative approach to altering data is to withhold it entirely. This can be achieved through\\nprivacy-enhancing technologies that block web tracking. While tracker-blocking browser extensions\\ncan provide some privacy to individuals, data can also be withheld collectively. Data strikes, a form\\nof digital boycott, can apply pressure to technology companies. Protest non-use is another way of\\nwithholding data, where people stop using platforms due to privacy concerns. These methods go\\nbeyond simple evasion, using the act of withholding data as a way to launch broader campaigns\\nagainst surveillance systems.\\n3 Challenging Models\\nWhile data-oriented approaches are helpful, policy solutions may offer a more effective way to\\nresist machine learning surveillance systems. For example, while strategies can help evade facial\\nrecognition, banning the technology would render those strategies unnecessary. There are many\\nforms that regulation can take and many roles that computer scientists can play in this process.\\nOne method of pressuring companies that develop surveillance technologies is through auditing.\\nResearch audits of facial recognition systems have shown they perform poorly on darker-skinned\\nsubjects, which has led to wrongful arrests. These audits have led some companies to stop selling\\nfacial recognition technology. However, audits do have limitations, as they can sometimes normalize\\nharmful tasks for certain communities.\\nSome technologies are difficult to audit due to restricted access. Nevertheless, these systems can\\nsometimes be reverse-engineered to show potential societal harms. Predictive policing systems, for\\ninstance, can amplify existing biases. Algorithmic audits or reverse engineering should focus on\\nbroader societal implications of the technology to avoid merely shifting goal posts and algorithmic\\nreformism.\\nResearchers have partnered with community organizations to resist surveillance technologies, debunk-\\ning the myth that critics do not understand the technology, and demystifying complex algorithms. It\\nis important for researchers to approach these collaborations with humility, as community organizers\\nbring their own areas of expertise.\\nIt is also crucial to recognize the academic community’s role in creating and upholding surveillance\\ntechnologies. Computer science educators should make computing’s role in injustice more visible.\\nStudent-led efforts can help educate future computer scientists about the consequences of their work.\\n4 Conclusion\\nThis paper has outlined various methods for resisting machine learning-based surveillance technolo-\\ngies. It emphasizes the need for participatory methods when developing anti-surveillance technologies.\\n2While these participatory methods are common in HCI research, the machine learning community\\nhas paid less attention to it. The impact of surveillance technologies is disproportionately borne by\\nalready marginalized groups. Therefore, it is critical that the design of anti-surveillance technologies\\nbe led by those who are most affected.\\n3'},\n",

However, comprehensive, col-\\nlaborative development and benchmarking solutions remain scarce. Proprietary\\nmodels like GPT-4o and Gemini have showcased impressive integration of audio,\\nvisual, and textual data, achieving response times between 200-250 milliseconds.\\nNonetheless, challenges persist in managing the trade-offs between latency, pre-\\ncision, financial cost, and data confidentiality. To address these complexities, we\\nintroduce OpenOmni, an open-source, end-to-end pipeline benchmarking platform.\\nOpenOmni incorporates advanced technologies such as Speech-to-Text, Emotion\\nDetection, Retrieval Augmented Generation, and Large Language Models, while\\nalso offering the capability to integrate custom models. It supports both local and\\ncloud deployment, thereby guaranteeing data privacy and providing latency and\\naccuracy benchmarking capabilities. This adaptable architecture allows researchers\\nto tailor the pipeline to pinpoint performance bottlenecks and expedite the de-\\nvelopment of proof-of-concept solutions. OpenOmni holds significant potential\\nto improve applications, including indoor assistance for individuals with visual\\nimpairments, thereby advancing human-computer interaction.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in interpreting user intent and\\nadhering to instructions. However, text-based human-computer interaction (HCI) is often inadequate.\\nThe recent introduction of models that process audio, video, and text in real-time highlights the\\nprogress towards multimodal interaction. The impressive performance, characterized by response\\ntimes of 200-250 milliseconds, makes these models suitable for large-scale applications. This marks\\na trend towards multimodal generative models and applications. One of the early publicly available\\nsolutions for multimodal large models that integrate text and images is available, but an open-source,\\nend-to-end conversational agent implementation has not yet been made publicly accessible online.\\nThe preferred mode of multimodal HCI should replicate human interaction, incorporating visual\\nand auditory inputs alongside audio outputs. Despite the existence of various modular components,\\na comprehensive, integrated, open-source implementation that fosters research and development\\nin this domain is lacking. The integration of existing models, such as audio speech recognition\\n(Speech2Text), multimodal large models (MLMs), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), into a mul-\\ntimodal conversation framework reveals substantial difficulties in managing latency and ensuring\\naccuracy. Traditionally, accuracy has posed a significant challenge. However, progress in large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) has significantly enhanced contextual relevance. The primary challenge\\nnow lies in minimizing end-to-end latency while maintaining high accuracy. Although it has been\\nshown that this is feasible, the open-source community has not yet replicated these results.\\nData privacy is another concern. The closed-source nature of certain solutions raises issues related to\\ncost and data confidentiality. Since these models are not open-source, users are required to upload\\ntheir data to servers via paid APIs, leading to privacy concerns. The privacy policy indicates that\\nvarious types of personal information are collected when users create accounts to access services,\\nsuch as account details, user-generated content, communication data, and social media information.To facilitate the swift and responsible development of this new form of HCI, it is crucial to establish\\nrobust evaluation and benchmarking protocols. For instance, if a user initiates a conversation with a\\nsad and urgent tone, the system should respond appropriately and with patience. Evaluating these\\ninteractions is both crucial and difficult for widespread adoption. This project aims to bridge these\\ngaps by:\\n• Creating an open-source framework to facilitate the development of customizable, end-to-\\nend conversational agents.\\n• Offering a fully local or controllable end-to-end multimodal conversation solution to address\\nprivacy concerns.\\n• Establishing tools for annotating and benchmarking latency and accuracy, allowing for rapid\\nproof-of-concept development and research.\\nTo accomplish this, we propose the OpenOmni framework, an open-source, end-to-end multimodal\\npipeline that integrates advanced technologies such as Speech-to-Text (Speech2Text), Emotion\\nDetection, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Text-to-\\nSpeech (TTS). This framework collects video and audio data via cameras and microphones, processes\\nthe data through a customizable agent pipeline, and responds using a speaker. OpenOmni can be\\ndeployed on a local server, ensuring secure data management and addressing privacy concerns.\\nFor research purposes, OpenOmni includes tools for straightforward annotation and benchmarking,\\noffering real-time monitoring and performance evaluation of latency. Users can annotate individ-\\nual components and entire conversations, generating comprehensive benchmark reports to identify\\nbottlenecks. The open-source nature of OpenOmni allows for adaptation across various application\\ndomains, such as aged care and personal assistants. Each pipeline component can be enabled or\\ndisabled based on specific use cases, facilitating flexible and efficient deployment. Moreover, the\\nframework supports the easy addition of new models, enabling comparisons and further experi-\\nmentation. The OpenOmni framework allows researchers to focus on solving critical bottlenecks\\nwithout reinventing the wheel, fostering innovation in multimodal conversational agents. It enables\\nrapid proof-of-concept development, such as indoor conversational robots assisting visually impaired\\nindividuals.\\n2 Related Work\\nTraditional end-to-end multimodal conversation systems typically employ a divide-and-conquer\\napproach, separating the process into sub-tasks: speech-to-text (automatic speech recognition), image-\\nto-text, text generation, and text-to-speech. Speech-to-text transforms spoken language into written\\ntext, while image-to-text produces textual descriptions of images. Text generation, often driven by\\nlarge language models, generates contextually appropriate responses, and text-to-speech converts\\nthese responses back into spoken form. These core components constitute the fundamental structure\\nof the conversational pipeline. The inclusion of image-to-text provides essential context, enhancing\\nnatural human-computer interaction, and additional functions like emotion detection adjust responses\\nbased on the user’s emotional state. An optional safeguard module can be integrated to guarantee that\\nresponses are suitable, non-harmful, and controlled, maintaining interaction integrity, particularly in\\ndelicate situations. Although this modular design enables the optimization of individual components,\\nthe cumulative latency and accuracy errors can make the complete system impractical for real-world\\nuse.\\nWhile certain models are presented as fully end-to-end solutions, capable of handling video, audio, or\\ntext inputs and producing audio, image, or text outputs, their technical specifics remain undisclosed.\\nIt is postulated that audio and video frames are processed by modules that generate text, audio, and\\nimage outputs. Demonstrations suggest that these models possess memory capabilities, though the\\ndetails and limitations are not fully understood. Whether the system can directly incorporate external\\nprivate data is also unknown.\\nUnlike the divide-and-conquer method, a fully end-to-end neural network can integrate more contex-\\ntual information, such as tone, the presence of multiple speakers, and background noises, leading to\\nmore adaptable outputs. Theoretically, this method can decrease latency by removing orchestration\\nbottlenecks. Nonetheless, both methods face substantial challenges because of the extensive data\\ninput and output, especially from video. The large size of video files puts a strain on servers and\\n2models, raising computational costs and introducing latency from data transfer and model inference.\\nReal-time conversation necessitates streaming processing, posing additional latency challenges. It\\nwas highlighted that a stable internet connection is needed to ensure smooth operation, underscoring\\nthese challenges.\\nA technology company has introduced a planned open-source, fully end-to-end multimodal conver-\\nsational AI, which supports text and audio modalities but excludes images. This model claims to\\nachieve an end-to-end latency of 200 milliseconds. Integrating video modality through an Image2Text\\nmodule into this model is possible, creating a hybrid solution that combines divide-and-conquer\\nand fully end-to-end approaches. Another viable hybrid solution involves using speech-to-text to\\nconvert audio into text, then feeding this text along with video (processed into image sequences)\\nto a vision language model, which generates text responses. These responses can subsequently be\\nprocessed through text-to-speech. Multimodal end-to-end conversational agents show promise, yet\\nlarge-scale implementation is challenging due to the need to balance latency, accuracy, and cost.\\nGenerating real-time responses within 200-400 milliseconds is difficult. The primary objective is to\\ndecrease latency and cost while enhancing accuracy, thereby improving the real-world applicability\\nof conversational agents.\\n2.1 Evaluation Metrics\\nTo ensure productive and effective collaboration, it is crucial to have consistent and comparable\\nevaluation metrics. For speech-to-text, the Word Error Rate (WER) is used to assess transcription\\naccuracy, where a lower WER signifies better performance. Evaluating text-to-speech involves\\nobjective metrics like the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for naturalness and intelligibility, and the\\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for clarity, along with subjective human ratings. Text generation is the\\nmost difficult to evaluate, using metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, which compare\\ngenerated text to reference texts but may not completely capture the quality and relevance of responses.\\nAssessing text generation often necessitates large-scale datasets, which are not always accessible.\\nThese metrics are widely adopted by the research community. Nevertheless, real-world applications\\nrequire evaluation in production environments, taking into account various factors beyond these\\nmetrics. For instance, a conversational agent designed for aged care should steer clear of sensitive\\ntopics that may be specific to each individual. Subjective opinions differ by region, emphasizing\\nthe necessity for adaptable and innovative automatic or semi-automatic evaluation methods for\\nconversational agents.\\n3 System Design\\n3.1 Requirement Analysis\\nThe system is designed to accept audio and video inputs and produce audio as output. Initially, two\\nmodules are required: one for gathering audio and video data from the microphone and camera, and\\nanother for emitting audio through a speaker. These Client modules must be compatible with a variety\\nof devices, such as smartphones, laptops, or Raspberry Pi. The data collected will be transmitted to a\\nserver.\\nThe server, known as the API, should handle audio and video data along with associated metadata.\\nIt should have access to a storage layer that includes a relational database, file management, and a\\ngraph database for potential GraphRAG integration. Although the API can be located on the same\\ndevice as the Client module, it is preferable to keep them separate for enhanced adaptability. This\\nseparation introduces the difficulty of transferring large volumes of data between modules. If the\\nAPI is cloud-based, audio and video data must be uploaded to the cloud, for instance, using AWS\\nS3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage. However, the upload process can introduce a\\nbottleneck, making data transfer time-intensive. If the server is local, within the same network as the\\nClient, transfer latency will be reduced. Nevertheless, this configuration necessitates running the large\\nlanguage model locally, which addresses data ownership and privacy issues but may increase model\\ninference latency and reduce accuracy due to limited computational resources. Another approach is\\nedge computing, where video data is pre-processed on edge devices and summarized for the API.\\nAlthough this could be a research direction, data compression might result in information loss and\\ndecrease overall performance.\\n3The pipeline components will require adjustments if developers intend to adopt the framework and\\nintegrate it with their work. To maintain flexibility, this part should be an independent module capable\\nof running locally or in the cloud. Researchers and developers should be able to easily incorporate\\nnew components into this Agent module, further complicating the sharing of large datasets between\\nmodules.\\nFinally, benchmarks are needed to comprehend the latency and accuracy performance of the entire\\npipeline. For tasks that are challenging to evaluate automatically, such as assessing the appropriateness\\nof the LLM response, we propose and develop an annotation module to allow human annotators to\\neasily evaluate results and generate benchmark reports.\\n3.2 System Architecture\\nBased on these requirements, the system architecture was designed as depicted in Figure 1. The\\nsystem is divided into five modules: Client, API, Storage, User Interface, and Agent, all primarily\\ndeveloped in Python. The Client module includes two submodules: the Listener for collecting video\\nand audio data, and the Responder for playing audio. The Storage module consists of file storage for\\nmedia, a relational database (PostgreSQL) for metadata, and a graph database (Neo4j) for potential\\nGraphRAG integration. The API module, built with the Django framework, extends Django’s admin\\ninterface and permission control system to develop the benchmark and annotation interface. Django’s\\nmaturity and large support community make it ideal for production development. The Agent module,\\nalso in Python, includes all agent-related submodules, allowing deployment on suitable compute\\nnodes without altering the architecture. Communication between the Client, API, and Agent modules\\nwill be via RESTful endpoints. For sharing large data between modules, local deployments (e.g.,\\nClient on Raspberry Pi, API and Agent on local servers) will use FTP for file synchronization. In\\ncloud solutions (e.g., AWS), files will be uploaded to AWS S3, triggering a Lambda function to\\ndownload files to an AWS Elastic File Storage (EFS) shared by the API and Agent modules. Docker\\nand Docker Compose are used to manage all modules, allowing easy setup with a single docker\\ncompose up command.\\n4 Demonstration\\n4.1 Datasets\\nMost multimodal question-answering datasets concentrate on multiple-choice questions rather than\\nopen-ended conversations. Some datasets involve multimodal conversations with images as additional\\ninput, but the output is often limited to multiple-choice or text. A significant challenge in developing\\nmultimodal conversational agents is the scarcity of suitable datasets.\\nAlthough there is an abundance of data from human-human interactions or data extracted from movies\\nand YouTube videos, efficient methods to organize this data into structured datasets are lacking. For\\nspecific domain applications, collecting data from human interactions and extracting datasets to train\\nsystems would be advantageous, enabling the agents to mimic human behavior. The OpenOmni\\nFramework offers both capabilities: extracting conversational datasets from videos and testing them\\nthrough the pipeline to assess agents’ responses, or gathering data from real-world scenarios to create\\ndatasets for further research.\\n4.2 Can \"AI\" be your president?\\nOne intensive conversational scenario is a debate. Segments were extracted from a US Presidential\\nDebate, focusing on a candidate addressing the public and handling questions. After downloading\\nthe videos, a prepared script in our codebase can be used to split them into segments. This script\\nallows for the specification of the start and end times of each conversation, enabling the creation\\nof a conversational dataset from the videos. These segments were fed into our pipeline to evaluate\\nits performance under different configurations: one using a commercial speech-to-text model, a\\nvision model, and text-to-speech (Configuration A); a locally deployed quantization LLM with a\\nspeech-to-text model, text-to-speech, and our emotion detection model for video input (Configuration\\nB); a version using a different LLM for inference (Configuration C); and a version using only a speech-\\nto-text model, a language model, and text-to-speech, ignoring the video modality (Configuration D).\\nThe Agent modules were run on a specific GPU with 12GB memory.\\n4The latency benchmark statistics are automatically generated. For example, Configuration A has\\nan average latency of 45 seconds, with the vision model accounting for 31 seconds. The fastest\\nconfiguration is Configuration D, averaging around 15 seconds, with most of the time consumed\\nby the text-to-speech part, because the generated content is quite long and comprehensive. The\\nslowest configuration is Configuration C, taking around 189 seconds, with the LLM model inference\\nstep taking the longest time. Configuration B takes an average of 60 seconds, with the LLM model\\ninference averaging 28 seconds and our emotion detection model averaging around 10 seconds.\\nTable 1: Accuracy: Overall Conversation Quality\\nTRACK ID USER ID OVERALL COMMENT OVERALL SCORE\\nf1 1 As the question is quite subjective, the answer is good and in context 4\\nf2 2 The answer is quite general, while the candidate is doing much better work with supported evidence. 2\\nf3 1 Failed to generate proper in-context response; the response is talking about how to respond, not actually responses 2\\nf4 1 Generate some general comments without strong support evidence 2\\nf5 1 General response, however, no good evidence to support. 3\\nAfter annotation with our interface, accuracy statistics are automatically generated. The accuracy\\nmetrics here include evaluation metrics like WER, CER for the speech-to-text task, and overall\\nscores given by the annotators. As shown in Table 1, the average score for each conversation is 2.4.\\nText-to-speech can be improved with more natural emotion or personality. The generated content\\nis often too general and sometimes inappropriate. The candidate’s responses are more in-context\\nand evidence-supported. The pipeline excelled only in answering a subjective question about the\\ncandidate’s age, where Configuration A performed well. Configuration D had the best overall\\naccuracy, but its responses were often in-context yet pompous. Thus, the candidate still outperforms\\nAI. In conclusion, \"AI cannot be the President of the US just yet, considering both latency and\\naccuracy.\"\\n4.3 Assist the Visually Impaired\\nWhile latency and the need for external information currently prevent AI from undertaking mission-\\ncritical tasks, conversational agents can be production-ready and useful for non-latency-critical areas\\nthat do not require extensive external knowledge. Assisting indoor activities for the visually impaired\\nis one such application, where high-speed internet can be utilized, or data transfer can be limited to\\nlocal exchanges. These types of applications can benefit from maintaining high input/output rates,\\nhelping to mitigate latency issues. Questions were prepared for the visually impaired, including\\nlocating objects, navigating indoors, and inquiries about the surroundings. Six questions were\\nsampled and fed to the Configuration A pipeline. One scenario demonstration is included in our\\nprovided video. In this scenario, video and audio data stream from the client side and are saved to\\nstorage along with exportable metadata accessible via the admin portal. This setup allows for the\\nexportation of annotated datasets, including raw video and audio data, for developing new models.\\nThe latency statistics show responses within approximately 30 seconds.\\nAnnotated results show a 4.7/5 accuracy, but the agent lacks specific skills for assisting the visually\\nimpaired. For example, ideally, it should provide step-by-step instructions on grabbing a coffee\\ncup rather than just a general description. This indicates that while conversational agents are nearly\\nready for assisting the visually impaired with indoor activities, improvements in latency and response\\nquality are still needed.\\n5 Conclusion\\nMultimodal conversational agents offer a more natural form of human-computer interaction, as\\ndemonstrated by models like GPT-4o. However, real-world constraints require a balance between\\ncost, latency, and accuracy, which may explain why the full capabilities of such models are not yet\\naccessible.\\nSeveral technical options exist to achieve this balance, including traditional divide-and-conquer\\nmethods, fully end-to-end models, and hybrid approaches. The fully end-to-end approach inherently\\nallows for lower latency, while the divide-and-conquer method faces latency issues when coordinating\\n5multiple components. Both approaches must address the challenge of handling large data I/O. If\\nmodels are deployed locally, local network I/O issues can be more manageable. However, some\\nmodels are closed-source, making local deployment impractical. While deploying other vision models\\nlocally is feasible, achieving high accuracy may be limited by local computational resources. Hybrid\\nsolutions provide alternative approaches: pre-processing or compressing large data locally and then\\nutilizing cloud-based models, or converting video to text and integrating it into the end-to-end voice\\nmodel.\\nWe developed the OpenOmni framework to enable researchers to integrate their work into an end-to-\\nend pipeline. The framework supports various solutions, allows for pipeline customization, generates\\nlatency performance reports, and provides an annotation interface for accuracy review. These features\\nfacilitate the creation of benchmark reports to identify and address key issues.\\nTesting with the US Presidential debate scenario highlighted latency as a critical issue, particularly\\nwith large video data. Integrating external knowledge remains a challenge, emphasizing the need\\nfor efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For applications like indoor assistance for the\\nvisually impaired, latency improvements and model adaptation are both essential.\\nThe OpenOmni framework can significantly benefit the research community by facilitating the\\ncollection and management of new datasets, integrating various conversational agents approaches,\\nand generating automatic latency benchmarks. Its annotation interface aids in accuracy performance\\nreview, making OpenOmni production-ready for suitable application scenarios and fostering further\\ndevelopment in multimodal conversational agents.\\n6'},\n",

       "  'file_content': 'Fast Vocabulary Transfer for Language Model\\nCompression\\nAbstract\\nReal-world business applications require a trade-off between language model\\nperformance and size. We propose a new method for model compression that relies\\non vocabulary transfer. We evaluate the method on various vertical domains and\\ndownstream tasks. Our results indicate that vocabulary transfer can be effectively\\nused in combination with other compression techniques, yielding a significant\\nreduction in model size and inference time while marginally compromising on\\nperformance.\\n1 Introduction\\nIn the last few years, many NLP applications have been relying more and more on large pre-trained\\nLanguage Models (LM). Because larger LMs, on average, exhibit higher accuracy, a common trend\\nhas been to increase the model’s size. Some LMs like GPT-3 and BLOOM have reached hundreds\\nof billion parameters. However, these models’ superior performance comes at the cost of a steep\\nincrease in computational footprint, both for development and for inference, ultimately hampering\\ntheir adoption in real-world business use-cases. Besides models that only a few hi-tech giants can\\nafford, like GPT-3, even smaller LMs with hundreds of million parameters could be too expensive\\nor infeasible for certain products. For one thing, despite being tremendously cheaper than their\\nbigger cousins, fine-tuning, deploying and maintaining large numbers of such models (one for each\\ndownstream task) soon becomes too expensive. Furthermore, latency and/or hardware requirements\\nmay limit their applicability to specific use-cases. For all these reasons, significant efforts - in both\\nacademic and industry-driven research - are oriented towards the designing of solutions to drastically\\nreduce the costs of LMs.\\nRecently, several attempts have been made to make these models smaller, faster and cheaper, while\\nretaining most of their original performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a teacher-student\\nframework, whereby the teacher consists of a pre-trained large model and the student of a smaller\\none. The teacher-student framework requires that both the teacher and the student estimate the same\\nprobability distribution. While the outcome is a smaller model, yet, this procedure constrains the\\nstudent to operate with the same vocabulary as the teacher in the context of Language Modeling.\\nIn this work, we explore a method for further reducing an LM’s size by compressing its vocabulary\\nthrough the training of a tokenizer in the downstream task domain. The tokenizer is a crucial part\\nof modern LMs. In particular, moving from word to subword- level, the tokenization solves two\\nproblems: vocabulary explosion and unknown words. Moreover, the capability to tokenize text\\neffectively in any domain is key for the massive adoption of pre-trained general-purpose LMs fine-\\ntuned on downstream tasks. Indeed, tokenizers are still able to process out-of-distribution texts at the\\ncost of producing frequent word splits into multiple tokens.\\nHowever, the language varies significantly in vertical domains or, more generally, in different topics.\\nHence, ad-hoc tokenizers, trained on the domain statistics, may perform a more efficient tokenization,\\nreducing on average the length of the tokenized sequences. This is important since compact and\\nmeaningful inputs could reduce computational costs, while improving performance. Indeed, memory\\nand time complexity of attention layers grows quadratically with respect to the sequence length.Furthermore, a vertical tokenizer may require a smaller vocabulary, which also affects the size of the\\nembedding matrix, hence further reducing the model’s size.\\nFollowing this intuition, we propose a V ocabulary Transfer (VT) technique to adapt LMs to in-domain,\\nsmaller tokenizers, in order to further compress and accelerate them. This technique is complementary\\nto the aforementioned model compression methods and independent of the type of tokenizer. As a\\nmatter of fact, we apply it in combination with KD.\\nOur experiments show that VT achieves an inference speed-up between x1.07 and x1.40, depending\\non the downstream task, with a limited performance drop, and that a combination of VT with KD\\nyields an overall reduction up to x2.76.\\nThe paper is organized as follows. After reviewing related works in Section 2, we present the\\nmethodology in Section 3, we then outline the experiments in Section 4 and draw our conclusions in\\nSection 5.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe goal of Model Compression is to shrink and optimize neural architectures, while retaining most\\nof their initial performance. Research on LM compression has been carried out following a variety of\\napproaches like quantization, pruning knowledge distillation, and combinations thereof.\\nA most popular distillation approach in NLP was proposed by Sanh et al. (2019). The obtained\\nmodel, called DistilBERT, is a smaller version of BERT, with the same architecture but half the layers,\\ntrained to imitate the full output distribution of the teacher (a pre-trained BERT model). DistilBERT\\nhas a 40\\nLittle focus has been devoted thus far to the role of tokenization in the context of model compression.\\nEven in domain adaptation, the vocabulary was kept the same. Both the versatility of the subword-\\nlevel tokenization, and the constraints imposed by the teacher- student framework (same output\\ndistribution), discouraged such investigations. Recently, Samenko et al. (2021) presented an approach\\nfor transferring the vocabulary of an LM into a new vocabulary learned from new domain, with the\\npurpose of boosting the performance of the fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, we are\\nthe first to study VT in the scope of model compression.\\n3 Vocabulary Transfer\\nLet us consider a LM, trained on a general-purpose domain Dgen and associated with a vocabulary\\nVgen. Such a vocabulary is used by the LM’s tokenizer in order to produce an encoding of the input\\nstring via an embedding matrix Egen defined on Vgen. More specifically, a tokenizer is a function\\nthat maps a textual string into a sequence of symbols of a given vocabulary V . Let T be a tokenizer\\nassociated with a vocabulary V and a string s, we have T : s → (t1, . . . , tn), ti ∈ V, ∀i = 1, . . . , n.\\nHence, the vocabulary of the tokenizer determines how words in a text are split, whether as words,\\nsub-words, or even characters. These symbols, which define the LM’s vocabulary, are statistically\\ndetermined by training the tokenizer to learn the distribution of a dataset.\\nNow, let us consider a vertical domain Din, also referred as in-domain. For the reasons discussed\\nearlier, a vocabulary Vin specialized on Din itself better fits the language distribution than Vgen.\\nUnfortunately, with a new vocabulary, embedding representations associated with the tokens of Vgen\\nwould be lost. Thus, VT aims to initialize Vin by re-using most of the information learned from the\\nLM pre-trained on Dgen. Once the new tokenizer Tin has been trained on the in-domain dataset Din\\nusing a given vocabulary size, Tin will be different from the LM’s tokenizer Tgen. However, the two\\ntokenizers’ vocabularies Vgen and Vin may still have a large portion of their symbols in common.\\nOur objective is to transfer most of the information from Vgen into Vin. To this end, we first define a\\nmapping between each symbol in Vin and a set of symbols in Vgen. Then, we define an assignment\\ncriterion, based on the mapping, to obtain the embeddings for the tokens of Tin.\\nOne such criterion, called V ocabulary Initialization with Partial Inheritance (VIPI), was defined by\\nSamenko et al. (2021). Whenever a token is in Vin but not in Vgen, VIPI calculates all the partitions\\nof the new token with tokens from Vgen, then takes the minimal partitions and finally averages them\\nto obtain an embedding for the new token. Differently, we define a simplified implementation of\\n2VIPI called FVT for Fast V ocabulary Transfer. Instead of calculating all tokenizations, FVT uses a\\nstraightforward assignment mechanism, whereby each token ti ∈ Vin is partitioned using Tgen. If ti\\nbelongs to both vocabularies, ti ∈ Vin ∩ Vgen, then Tgen(ti) =ti and the in-domain LM embedding.\\nEin(ti) =Egen(ti). (1)\\nIf instead ti ∈ Vin \\\\ Vgen, then the in-domain embedding is the average of the embeddings associated\\nwith the tokens produced by Tgen:\\nEin(t :) = 1\\n|Tgen(ti)|\\nX\\ntj∈Tgen(ti)\\nEgen(tj) (2)\\nPlease notice that Equation (2) is a generalization of Equation (1). Indeed, in case ti ∈ Vin ∩ Vgen,\\nEquation (2) falls back to Equation (1).\\nOnce embeddings are initialized with FVT, we adjust the model’s weights by training it with MLM\\non the in-domain data before fine-tuning it on the downstream task. MLM eases adaptation and has\\nalready been found to be beneficial in (Samenko et al., 2021). We observed this trend as well during\\npreliminary experiments, therefore we kept such a tuning stage in all our experiments.\\nAs a baseline model, we also implement a method called Partial V ocabulary Transfer (PVT), whereby\\nonly the tokens belonging to both vocabularies ti ∈ Vin ∩ Vgen are initialized with pre-trained\\nembeddings, while unseen new tokens are randomly initialized.\\n3.1 Distillation\\nVT can be combined with other model compression methods like quantization, pruning and KD. For\\nsome of the methods, the combination is trivial, since they have no impact on the vocabulary. KD,\\nhowever, requires the vocabularies of the student and teacher to be aligned. Hence, its integration\\nwith VT is non-trivial. Accordingly, we set up a KD procedure with VT, in order to determine the\\neffects of applying both VT and KD to an LM.\\nOur distillation consists of two steps. In the first step, we replicate the distillation process used in\\n(Sanh et al., 2019) for DistilBERT, in which the number of layers of the encoder is halved and a\\ntriple loss-function is applied: a distillation loss, a MLM loss, and a cosine embedding loss. However,\\nunlike the original setup, we do not remove the token-type embeddings and pooler. after distilling the\\nstudent on Dgen, we further distil the student using Din. However, instead of adapting the teacher\\nbefore the second distillation, we simply distil the student a second time on the in-domain dataset.\\nFinally, we apply VT using either FVT or PVT and fine-tune the student model on the in-domain\\ndatasets.\\nOur choice of applying VT after KD is based on findings by Kim and Hassan (2020), that different\\ninput embedding spaces will produce different output embedding spaces. This difference in spaces is\\nnot conducive to knowledge transfer during distillation. Hence, if VT were to be applied first to the\\nstudent, its input embedding space would differ greatly from that of the pre-trained teacher during\\ndistillation.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn the experiments we measure the impact of FVT on three main KPIs: quality (F1 score), size of the\\nmodels and speedup in inference.\\n4.1 Experimental Setup\\nWe consider for all our experiments the pre-trained cased version of BERTbase as our pre-trained\\nlanguage model. Its tokenizer is composed of 28996 wordpieces. We then define four vocabulary\\nsizes for retraining our tokenizers. Specifically, we take the original vocabulary size and define it\\nas a vocabulary size of 100 percent. We subsequently reduce this size to 75percent, 50percent, and\\n25percent, From now on, we will refer to such tokenizers as T100, T75, T50, T25 respectively, while\\nthe original vocabulary will be called Tgen.\\n3Models are fine-tuned for 10 epochs with early stopping on the downstream task. We set the initial\\nlearning rate to 3 ×10−5 and batch size to 64 for each task. The sequence length is set to 64 for ADE\\nand CoNLL03 and 128 for LEDGAR. Each configuration is repeated 3 times with different random\\ninitializations. MLM is performed for one epoch.\\n4.2 Datasets\\nTo best assess the effectiveness of VT, we apply it on three different tasks from three heterogeneous\\nlinguistic domains: medical (ADE), legal (LEDGAR) and news (CoNLL03). Table 4 reports the\\ndataset statistics.\\nADE. The Adverse Drug Events (ADE) corpus is a binary sentence\\nclassification dataset in the medical domain. This domain is particularly suitable for investigating the\\nbenefits of VT, since documents are characterized by the presence of frequent technical terms, such\\nas drug and disease names, that are usually rare in common language. Domain-specific words are\\nusually split into multiple tokens, yielding longer sequences and breaking the semantics of a word\\ninto multiple pieces. An example is shown in Figure 2.\\nLEDGAR. LEDGAR is a document classification corpus of legal provisions in contracts from\\nthe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The dataset is annotated with 100 different\\nmutually-exclusive labels. It is also part of LexGLUE, a benchmark for legal language understanding.\\nCoNLL03. CoNLL03 is a popular Named Entity Recognition (NER) benchmark. It is made of news\\nstories from the Reuters corpus. We chose this corpus because, differently from ADE and LEDGAR,\\nthe news domain typically uses a more standard language, hence we expect its distribution to differ\\nless from the one captured by a general-purpose tokenizers in the web. Statistics in Table 1 confirms\\nthis hypothesis. We can observe that the sequence compression gain obtained with domain- specific\\ntokenizers is less significant with respect to LEDGAR and ADE.\\nTable 1: Number of examples of each dataset.\\nDataset Train Validation Test\\nADE 16716 3344 836\\nLEDGAR 60000 10000 10000\\nCoNLL03 14042 3251 3454\\n4.3 Results\\nWe report an extensive evaluation of FVT on different setups and perspectives.\\nIn-domain Tokenization. By retraining the tokenizer on the in-domain dataset, the average number of\\ntokens per sequence decreases since the learned distribution reduces the number of word splits, as\\nshown in Table 1. In the medical domain, which is particularly specialized, we notice a remarkable\\n32\\nTable 2: Average sequence length on the three datasets with different tokenizers.

The results summarized in Table 3 clearly indicate that KD\\nis complementary to VT: there is no harm in applying them together, in terms of performance on\\nthe downstream task. Crucially, this guarantees a full exploitation of FVT in the scope of language\\nmodel compression.\\nCompression and Efficiency. After showcasing that VT has limited impact on performance, we\\nanalyze and discuss its effects on efficiency and model compression. Table 5 reports the relative\\nF1 drop on the downstream task with respect to the original LM (˘2206F1), the relative reduction in\\nmodel size (˘2206Size) and the speedup gained by FVT alone and by FVT combined with KD for\\nvarying vocabulary sizes. Either way, FVT achieves a remarkable 15\\nFurthermore, the reduced input length enabled by in-domain tokenization brings a reduction in\\ninference time.

       "  'file_content': 'Collaborative Clothing Segmentation and\\nIdentification Through Image Analysis\\nAbstract\\nThis research introduces a comprehensive clothing co-parsing system designed\\nto analyze a collection of clothing images, which are unsegmented but include\\ndescriptive tags. The system aims to segment these images into meaningful config-\\nurations. The proposed method uses a two-stage, data-driven approach. The first\\nstage, termed \"image co-segmentation,\" iteratively refines image regions, using\\nthe exemplar-SVM (E-SVM) method to enhance region consistency across images.\\nThe second stage, \"region co-labeling,\" utilizes a multi-image graphical model\\nwhere segmented regions serve as nodes. This incorporates contextual information\\nabout clothing, such as item placement and interactions, which can be solved using\\nthe efficient Graph Cuts algorithm. The system’s performance is tested on the\\nFashionista dataset and a newly developed dataset called CCP, which contains 2098\\nhigh-resolution street fashion images. The results show a segmentation accuracy of\\n90.29% and 88.23% and a recognition rate of 65.52% and 63.89% on the Fashion-\\nista and CCP datasets, respectively, demonstrating an improvement over current\\nleading methods.\\n1 Introduction\\nThe growth of online clothing sales has increased the demand for accurate clothing recognition and\\nretrieval technologies. This has led to the development of several vision-based solutions. A key\\nchallenge in these systems is the detailed, pixel-level labeling of clothing, which is often resource-\\nintensive. However, image-level tags from user data offer a viable alternative. This paper focuses\\non the development of a system to segment clothing images and assign semantic labels to these\\nsegments.\\nThe main contribution of this work is an effective system for parsing groups of clothing images and\\nproviding precise pixel-level annotations. The system addresses the following significant challenges:\\n• Clothes exhibit a wide variety of styles and textures, making them difficult to segment and\\nidentify using only basic visual features.\\n• Variations in human poses and the way clothes can obscure themselves complicate the\\nrecognition process.\\n• The existence of numerous, highly specific clothing categories, such as over 50 in the\\nFashionista dataset, far more than in existing co-segmentation systems which typically\\nhandle fewer categories.\\nTo overcome these challenges, the system employs two sequential stages: image co-segmentation\\nto isolate distinct clothing regions and region co-labeling to identify different clothing items, as\\nillustrated below. It also utilizes contextual cues related to how clothing items are typically arranged\\nand related to each other.\\nThe co-segmentation phase refines regions across images using the E-SVM method. Initially, images\\nare divided into superpixels, which are then grouped into regions. Many of these regions may not be\\n.meaningful due to the diversity of clothing and human poses. However, certain stable regions are\\nidentified based on criteria like size and position. E-SVM classifiers are trained for these selected\\nregions using HOG features, creating region-based detectors that help identify similar regions across\\nimages. This approach is based on the observation that similar clothing items often share visual\\npatterns.\\nThe co-labeling phase uses a data-driven approach, constructing a multi-image graph where regions\\nare treated as nodes. Connections are made between adjacent regions within an image, as well as\\nbetween regions in different images that share visual or tag similarities. This strategy allows for\\ncollective label assignment, leveraging similarities across images. The optimization is performed\\nusing the Graph Cuts algorithm, considering various clothing context constraints.\\n2 Related Work\\nPrevious research on clothing and human segmentation has often focused on creating detailed models\\nto handle the diversity in clothing styles and appearances. Some of the classic work used And-Or\\ngraph templates to model and parse clothing configurations. Subsequent studies explored blocking\\nmodels for segmenting clothes in images where items were heavily obscured, and deformable spatial\\nmodels to enhance segmentation accuracy. Recent approaches have used shape-based human models\\nor combined pose estimation with supervised region labeling, achieving notable results. However,\\nthese methods have not been applied to clothing co-parsing and typically demand significant labeling\\neffort.\\nResearch on image/object co-labeling, which jointly processes a set of images containing similar\\nobjects, has been explored. Methods include unsupervised shape-guided approaches for single-\\ncategory co-labeling and incorporating automatic image segmentation with spatially coherent latent\\ntopic models for unsupervised multi-class labeling. These unsupervised methods can struggle with a\\nlarge number of categories and diverse appearances. Recent efforts have focused on supervised label\\npropagation, using pixel-level label maps to assign labels to new images. However, these methods are\\noften limited by the need for detailed annotations and rely on pixel-level correspondences, which\\nmay not be effective for clothing parsing.\\n3 Methodology\\nThis research introduces a probabilistic model for the co-parsing of clothing images. The input\\nconsists of a set of clothing images, denoted as I = {Ii}N\\ni=1, each associated with tags Ti. Each\\nimage Ii is represented by a set of superpixels, Ii = {sj}M\\nj=1, which are subsequently grouped into\\ncoherent regions. Each image is associated with four additional variables:\\n(a) Regions {rk}K\\nk=1, each comprising a set of superpixels.\\n(b) Garment labels for each region, denoted as ℓk ∈ T, where k = 1, . . . , K.\\n(c) E-SVM weights wk trained for each selected region.\\n(d) Segmentation propagations C = (x, y, m), where (x, y) is the location and m is the\\nsegmentation mask of an E-SVM, indicating that mask m can be propagated to position\\n(x, y) of Ii.\\nThe objective is to optimize parameters by maximizing the posterior probability:\\n{L∗, R∗, W∗, C∗} = arg maxP(L, R, W, C|I)\\nThis probability can be factorized into co-labeling and co-segmentation components:\\nP(L, R, W, C|I) ∝ P(L|R, C) ×\\nNY\\ni=1\\nP(Ri|Ci, Ii)P(Wi|Ri)P(Ci|Wi, Ii)\\nThe optimization process involves two phases: clothing image co-segmentation and co-labeling.\\n2In the co-segmentation phase, optimal regions are obtained by maximizing P(R|C, I). A superpixel\\ngrouping indicator oj ∈ {1, . . . , K} is introduced, indicating the region to which superpixel sj\\nbelongs. Each region rk is defined as rk = {sj|oj = k}. The probability P(R|C, I) is defined as:\\nP(R|C, I) =\\nY\\ni\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8f0P(ri|C, I)\\nY\\nsj∈Ii\\nP(oj|C, Ii)\\nY\\n(m,n)\\nP(om, on, sm, sn|C)\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fb\\nThe unary potential P(oj, sj) indicates the probability of superpixel sj belonging to a region, and the\\npairwise potential P(om, on, sm, sn|C) encourages smoothness between neighboring superpixels.\\nCoherent regions are selected to train E-SVMs by maximizing P(W|R):\\nP(W|R) =\\nY\\nk\\nP(wk|rk) ∝\\nY\\nk\\nexp{−E(wk, rk) − ϕ(rk)}\\nwhere ϕ(rj) indicates whether rj has been chosen for training E-SVM, and E(wk, rk) is the convex\\nenergy function of E-SVM.\\nFinally, P(Ci|Wi, Ii) is defined based on the responses of E-SVM classifiers, maximized by selecting\\nthe top k detections of each E-SVM as segmentation propagations.\\nIn the co-labeling phase, a multi-image graphical model is used to assign a garment tag to each\\nregion:\\nP(L|R, C) ∝\\nNY\\ni\\nKY\\nk\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8f0P(ℓik, ri)\\nY\\n(m,n)\\nP(ℓim, ℓin, ri, rj)\\nY\\n(u,v)\\nQ(ℓiu, ℓiv, ru, rv|C)\\n\\uf8f9\\n\\uf8fb\\nwhere P(ℓik, ri) is the singleton potential, P(ℓim, ℓin, ri, rj) is the interior affinity model, and\\nQ(ℓiu, ℓiv, ru, rv|C) is the exterior affinity model.\\n3.1 Unsupervised Image Co-Segmentation\\nThe co-segmentation process involves iteratively refining regions, E-SVM weights, and segmentation\\npropagations.\\nSuperpixel Grouping: A linear programming problem is formulated to determine the number of\\nregions automatically:\\narg min\\nX\\ne\\nd(se1, se2)oe +\\nX\\nc∈C\\nh(c)oc\\nwhere d(se1, se2) is the dissimilarity between superpixels and h(c) measures the consistency of\\ngrouping superpixels covered by an E-SVM mask.\\nTraining E-SVMs: The energy function for training E-SVMs is:\\nE(wk, rk) =λ1\\n2 ||wk||2 +\\nX\\nsj∈rk\\nmax(0, 1 − wT\\nk f(sj)) +λ2\\nX\\nsn∈NE\\nmax(0, 1 +wT\\nk f(sn))\\nSegmentation Propagation: The E-SVM response is calibrated using a logistic distribution:\\nSE(f; w) = 1\\n1 + exp(−αE(wT f − βE))\\n3.2 Contextualized Co-Labeling\\nIn this phase, a multi-image graphical model connects all images, incorporating two types of clothing\\ncontexts.

       "  'file_content': 'Real-Time Adaptation of Lexical Embeddings for\\nEnhanced Part-of-Speech Tagging\\nAbstract\\nThis research introduces a method for real-time unsupervised domain adaptation\\n(DA) that can be applied incrementally as new information arrives. This method is\\nespecially useful when conventional batch DA is unfeasible. Through evaluations\\nfocused on part-of-speech (POS) tagging, we observe that real-time unsupervised\\nDA achieves accuracy levels on par with those of batch DA.\\n1 Introduction\\nUnsupervised domain adaptation is a frequently encountered challenge for developers aiming to\\ncreate robust natural language processing (NLP) systems. This situation typically arises when labeled\\ndata is available for a source domain, but there is a need to enhance performance in a target domain\\nusing only unlabeled data. A majority of the current NLP research on unsupervised domain adaptation\\nemploys batch learning, which presumes the availability of a substantial corpus of unlabeled data\\nfrom the target domain before the testing phase. However, batch learning is impractical in numerous\\nreal-world situations where data from a new target domain must be processed without delay. Further,\\nin many practical scenarios, data may not be neatly categorized by domain, making it difficult to\\nimmediately discern when an input stream begins providing data from a new domain.\\nFor instance, consider an NLP system within a company that is tasked with analyzing a continuous\\nstream of emails. This stream evolves over time without any explicit signals indicating that the\\ncurrent models should be adjusted to the new data distribution. Given that the system is expected to\\noperate in real-time, it would be beneficial for any system adaptation to be done in an online manner,\\nas opposed to the batch method, which involves halting the system, modifying it, and then restarting\\nit.\\nThis paper introduces real-time unsupervised domain adaptation as an enhancement to conventional\\nunsupervised DA. In this approach, domain adaptation is carried out incrementally as data is received.\\nSpecifically, our implementation involves a type of representation learning, where the focus is on\\nupdating word representations in our experiments. Every instance a word appears in the data stream\\nduring testing, its representation is refined.\\nTo our understanding, the research presented here is the first to examine real-time unsupervised\\nDA. In particular, we assess this method for POS tagging tasks. We analyze POS tagging outcomes\\nusing three different methods: a static baseline, batch learning, and real-time unsupervised DA. Our\\nfindings indicate that real-time unsupervised DA performs comparably to batch learning, yet it does\\nnot require retraining or pre-existing data from the target domain.\\n2 Experimental setup\\nTagger. We have adapted the FLORS tagger, which is recognized for its speed and simplicity,\\nand is particularly effective in DA scenarios. This tagger approaches POS tagging as a multi-label\\nclassification problem within a window-based framework, rather than a sequence classification\\none. FLORS is well-suited for real-time unsupervised DA because its word representations includedistributional vectors, which can be updated during both batch learning and real-time unsupervised\\nDA. Each word’s representation in FLORS consists of four feature vectors: one for its suffix, one for\\nits shape, and one each for its left and right distributional neighbors. Suffix and shape features are\\nstandard in the literature, and we utilize them as described previously.\\nDistributional features. The ith element xi of the left distributional vector for a word w is the\\nweighted count of times the indicator word ci appears immediately to the left of w:\\nxi = tf(freq (bigram(ci, w))) (1)\\nwhere ci is the word with frequency rank i in the corpus, freq(bigram(ci, w)) is the occurrence count\\nof the bigram \"ci w\", and non-zero frequencies are weighted logarithmically: tf(x) = 1 + log(x). The\\nright distributional vector is defined similarly. We limit the set of indicator words to the 500 most\\nfrequent. To avoid zero vectors, an additional element xn+1 is added to each vector to account for\\nomitted contexts:\\nxn + 1 = tf(\\nX\\n.5freq (bigram(ci, w))) (2)\\nLet f(w) be the concatenation of the two distributional, suffix, and shape vectors of word w. Then\\nFLORS represents token vi as follows:\\nf(viΦ22122)Φ2295f(viΦ22121)Φ2295f(vi)Φ2295f(vi + 1)Φ2295f(vi + 2) (3)\\nwhere ˘2295 is vector concatenation. FLORS then tags token vi based on this representation.\\nFLORS operates under the assumption that the fundamental relationship between distributional\\nfeatures and labels remains consistent when transitioning from the source to the target domain. This\\ncontrasts with other studies that select \"stable\" distributional features and discard \"unstable\" ones.\\nThe central hypothesis of FLORS is that fundamental distributional POS characteristics are relatively\\nstable across different domains, unlike semantic or more intricate tasks. The effectiveness of FLORS\\nsuggests the validity of this hypothesis.\\nData. Test set.Our evaluation utilizes the development sets from six different target domains (TDs):\\nfive SANCL domains (newsgroups, weblogs, reviews, answers, emails) and sections 22-23 of the\\nWall Street Journal (WSJ) for in-domain testing.\\nTwo training sets of varying sizes are employed. In the l:big condition (large labeled data set), FLORS\\nis trained on sections 2-21 of the WSJ. The l:small condition uses 10% of the l:big data set.\\nData for word representations.We also adjust the size of the datasets used for computing word\\nrepresentations before training the FLORS model. In the u:big condition, distributional vectors are\\ncomputed on the combined corpus of all labeled and unlabeled text from both source and target\\ndomains (excluding test sets), along with 100,000 WSJ sentences from 1988 and 500,000 sentences\\nfrom a large external corpus. In the u:0 condition, only labeled training data is utilized.\\nMethods. We implemented a modification from the original setup: distributional vectors are stored\\nin memory as count vectors, enabling count increases during online tagging.\\nExperiments are conducted with three versions of FLORS: STATIC, BATCH, and ONLINE. All three\\nmethods compute word representations on \"data for word representations\" before model training on\\none of the two \"training sets\".\\nSTATIC. Word representations remain unchanged during testing.\\nBATCH. Before testing, count vectors are updated by freq(bigram(ci, w)) += freq*(bigram(ci, w)),\\nwhere freq*(˘00b7) denotes the bigram \"ci w\" occurrences in the entire test set.\\nONLINE. Before tagging a test sentence, both left and right distributional vectors are updated via\\nfreq(bigram(ci, w)) += 1 for each \"ci w\" bigram appearance in the sentence. The sentence is then\\ntagged using the updated word representations. As tagging progresses, distributional representations\\nbecome increasingly specific to the target domain (TD), converging to the representations that BATCH\\nuses at the end of the tagging process.\\n2In all three modes, suffix and shape features are always fully specified, for both known and unknown\\nwords.\\n3 Experimental results\\nTable 1 shows that the performance levels of BATCH and ONLINE are on par with each other and\\nrepresent the current state-of-the-art.

The reasons for ONLINE\\noccasionally outperforming BATCH, particularly in certain conditions, are discussed subsequently.\\n3.1 Time course of tagging accuracy\\nThe ONLINE model introduced here has a unique characteristic not commonly found in other\\nstatistical NLP research: its predictive accuracy evolves as it processes text due to the modification of\\nits representations.\\nTo analyze the progression of these changes over time, a substantial application domain is necessary\\nbecause subtle changes might be too inconsistent in the smaller test sets of the SANCL TDs. The\\nWSJ corpus is the only labeled domain that is sufficiently large for this purpose. Consequently, we\\ninvert the usual setup by training the model on the development sets of the five SANCL domains\\n(l:big) or on the initial 5000 labeled words of reviews (l:small).

       "  'file_content': 'Flexible Online Aggregations Using Basis Function Expansions\\nAbstract\\nBayesian learning often necessitates online inference, adaptive models, and the combination of multiple distinct\\nmodels. Recent advancements have demonstrated the use of random feature approximations for scalable, online\\naggregation of Gaussian processes, which possess favorable theoretical characteristics and practical uses. A crucial\\naspect of these methods is the incorporation of a random walk on model parameters, which introduces adaptability.\\nWe demonstrate that these methods can be readily extended to any model using basis function expansion and that\\nemploying alternative basis expansions, such as Hilbert space Gaussian processes, frequently leads to enhanced\\nperformance. To streamline the selection of a specific basis expansion, the versatility of our approach also enables\\nthe aggregation of several entirely different models, such as a Gaussian process and polynomial regression. Lastly,\\nwe introduce an innovative technique for combining both static and dynamic models.\\n1 Introduction\\nNumerous machine learning applications demand real-time, online data processing, a scenario that frequently requires substantial\\nalterations to conventional techniques. Online adaptations of various methods have been developed, including kernel machines,\\n(kernel) least-squares, and Gaussian processes. The field of online learning has also been thoroughly investigated from an optimization\\nstandpoint.\\nOnline learning can be further complicated when model selection is needed, as the best-performing model is rarely evident at the\\noutset of the learning process. One solution involves training multiple models concurrently and then combining them. In a Bayesian\\nframework, Bayesian model averaging (BMA) has long been employed to combine online models, functioning by assigning weights\\nto each \"expert\" model based on its supporting evidence.\\nMore recently, it was shown how to adapt BMA to online Gaussian processes (GPs) in a technique called incremental ensembles\\nof GPs. GPs are a versatile, non-parametric instrument in Bayesian machine learning that possesses universal approximation\\ncapabilities and provides well-founded uncertainty estimations. By employing a random Fourier feature (RFF) approximation for\\nGaussian processes, online learning can be executed, featuring closed-form Bayesian model averaging updates and a manageable\\nregret analysis.\\nBesides an online ensemble of GPs, the advantages of incorporating random walks on model parameters were illustrated, which they\\nterm dynamic IE-GPs (DIE-GPs). This can significantly enhance performance when the learning task undergoes slight changes over\\ntime.\\n2 Related Work\\nThe concept of combining random feature GPs, as introduced by IE-GPs, has demonstrated adaptability and effectiveness. Extensions\\nto this framework encompass Gaussian process state-space models, deep Gaussian processes, and graph learning. Along with its\\nextensions, DIE-GPs have been effectively applied in Bayesian optimization and causal inference.\\nHowever, the dependence on the RFF approximation implies that IE-GPs also inherit the limitations of random feature GPs.\\nSpecifically, the RFF approximation is a direct Monte Carlo approximation of the Wiener-Khinchin integral and thus is significantly\\nimpacted by the curse of dimensionality. Our findings reveal that on several real-world datasets, (D)IE-GPs exhibit performance that\\nis comparable to or worse than that of simpler models, such as online Bayesian linear regression and one-layer RBF networks.\\n3 Methodology\\nIn this paper, we present online ensembles of basis expansions (OEBEs), a generalization of IE-GPs that overcomes their dependence\\non RFF GPs and enhances performance across multiple real datasets. Our specific contributions are as follows:1. We observe that the derivation of DIE-GPs does not rely on the RFF approximation, except for its role as a linear basis\\nexpansion. The same derivations and code can be reused to combine arbitrary Bayesian linear models with any design matrix.\\nThis allows for the combination of not only models of the same type but also various distinct basis expansions (e.g., B-splines,\\none-layer RBF networks, etc.). 2. We contend that a GP with a generalized additive model (GAM) structure is often more\\nsuitable when GP regression is the focus. To this end, we employ GAM Hilbert space Gaussian processes (HSGPs), which can\\nbe interpreted as a quadrature rule for the same integral that the RFF approximation addresses through direct Monte Carlo. Apart\\nfrom theoretical considerations, empirical evidence indicates that HSGPs converge to the true approximated GP more rapidly (in\\nterms of the number of basis functions) than RFF GPs. We offer a similar empirical evaluation. 3. We introduce a new method for\\nintegrating static and dynamic models, enabling the use of principled posteriors of static methods when appropriate and extending\\nthe expressiveness of dynamic methods otherwise. We demonstrate the necessity of this method by providing a constructive example\\non real data where the naive approach to combining static and dynamic methods is unsuccessful. 4. We provide Jax/Objax code\\nat https://www.github.com/danwaxman/DynamicOnlineBasisExpansions that only requires the user to specify the design\\nmatrix, with several choices already implemented.\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews foundational concepts in linear basis expansions, GP regression,\\nspectral approximations of GPs, and BMA. These concepts are put into practice in Section 3, where we present the OEBEs and\\nseveral extensions, including applications to non-Gaussian likelihoods, and provide some concise theoretical observations. We offer\\nfurther practical insights regarding the development of OEBEs, including a discussion on the composition of an ensemble and how\\nto combine static and dynamic models in Section 4. The proposed models are empirically evaluated in Section 5. Finally, we present\\nconcluding remarks and suggest future directions in Section 6.\\n4 Experiments\\nWe present three distinct experiments in the main text, with supplementary experiments in the appendices. In the first experiment\\n(Section 5.1), we assess ensembles of several different basis expansions, demonstrating that the best-performing model varies\\nconsiderably. In the second experiment (Section 5.2), we illustrate how model collapse can occur between static and dynamic models\\nand how the model introduced in Section 4.2 mitigates this issue. Lastly, we demonstrate that E-DOEBE can effectively combine\\nmethods that are both static and dynamic, and of different basis expansions (Section 5.3).\\nThe metrics we employ are the normalized mean square error (nMSE) and the predictive log-likelihood (PLL). The nMSE is defined\\nas the MSE of yt with the predictive mean, divided by the variance of y1:T. Specifically, at time t, the nMSE is calculated as:\\nnMSE t =\\nPt\\nτ=1(µyτ −yτ )2\\nt·V ar(y1:T )\\nThe predictive log-likelihood (PLL) is the average value of log p(yt+1|X1:t, y1:t), i.e.,\\nPLLt =\\nPt\\nτ=1 log p(yτ+1|X1:τ ,y1:τ )\\nt .\\nAcross all experiments, we utilize several publicly available datasets, varying in both size and the number of features. A summary\\nof dataset statistics is provided in Table 1. Friedman 1 and Friedman 2 are synthetic datasets designed to be highly nonlinear and,\\nnotably, are i.i.d. The Elevators dataset pertains to controlling the elevators on an aircraft. The SARCOS dataset uses simulations of\\na robotic arm, and Kuka 1 is a similar real dataset derived from physical experiments. CaData comprises California housing data,\\nand the task of CPU Small is to predict a type of CPU usage based on system properties.\\nAll hyperparameter optimization was performed on the first 1,000 samples of each dataset; since we already assume access, each\\ndataset was additionally standardized in both x and y using the statistics of the first 1,000 samples. We follow prior work in setting a\\nweight to 0 when it falls below the threshold of 10-16.\\n4.1 Comparing Different Basis Expansions\\nTo demonstrate that having a diverse set of basis expansion models available is beneficial, we evaluate several model types on each\\ndataset listed in Table 1. Furthermore, we examine both static and dynamic versions of models to assess their performance.\\nModels used for comparison include an additive HSGP model [(D)OE-HSGP], an RFF GP [(D)OE-RFF], an ensemble of quadratic,\\ncubic, and quartic polynomials with additive structure [(D)OE-Poly], linear regression [(D)OE-Linear], and a one-layer RBF network\\n[(D)OE-RBF]. Apart from additional hyperparameter tuning in an ARD kernel, the (D)OE-RFF model is identical to the (D)IE-GP.\\nFor RFF GPs, 50 Fourier features were employed (resulting in F = 2 × 50), and for HSGPs, ˘230a100/D˘230b features were used for\\neach dimension (resulting in F ˘2272 100). An SE-ARD kernel was utilized in both cases. For RBF networks, 100 locations were\\ninitialized using K-means and subsequently optimized with empirical Bayes, along with ARD length scales. For all models except\\nRBF networks, ensembles were generated using the process outlined in Section 4.1 ˘2014 for RBF networks, the computation of the\\nHessian was too computationally demanding, so parameters were randomly perturbed by white Gaussian noise with variance 10-3\\ninstead.\\nFor dynamic models, ˘03c32 was set to 10 -3. The initial values of ˘03c32 ˘03b8 and ˘03c32 ˘03f5 were 1.0 and 0.25, respectively.\\nOptimization was carried out using Adam.\\n2Results of the average nMSE and PLL are presented in Table 2 and Table 3. We observe that the best-performing class of models\\nvaries significantly across datasets. Specifically, in terms of both nMSE and PLL, HSGPs, RFF GPs, and RBF networks each achieve\\nthe best performance on at least one dataset. This reinforces the notion that combining several different models is advantageous, as\\nno single method consistently outperforms the others.\\nMoreover, as anticipated, dynamic models can substantially outperform static models in specific scenarios (e.g., on SARCOS and\\nKuka 1) but yield a lower PLL on datasets where the data is reasonably i.i.d. (e.g., Friedman 1).\\nAs expected, when an additive structure is a reasonable approximation, additive HSGP methods surpass RFF GPs, for instance, on\\nKuka 1 and CaData. The RFF GP approximation rarely exhibits particularly poor performance, making it a consistently \"good\"\\nestimator, and it achieves the highest PLL on Friedman 2, SARCOS, and CPU Small. However, it is also occasionally outperformed\\nby simpler methods, such as the RBF network, highlighting the potential advantages of employing diverse basis expansions.\\nKey Takeaways Key takeaways from this experiment include: (1) neither dynamic nor static methods are strictly superior across all\\nsettings, (2) no single basis expansion is superior across all datasets, and (3) RFF GPs consistently provide good performance, but\\nthis performance can often be improved upon by using other basis expansions.\\n4.2 The Necessity of Ensembles of Dynamic Ensembles\\nIn this experiment, we demonstrate that the E-DOEBE model introduced in Section 4.2 can indeed prevent the premature collapse of\\nBMA weights. While this premature collapse of BMA weights does not appear to be common in real datasets, it is not difficult to\\nillustrate its possibility, even on real datasets with high-performing methods.\\nAs a constructive example, we can create an ensemble of additive HSGPs on the Kuka 1 dataset, where dynamic models performed\\nsignificantly better in Section 5.1. Specifically, we created an ensemble of two additive HSGPs, with the first model being dynamic\\n(˘03c3(1)rw2 = 10-3) and the second model being static ( ˘03c3(2) = 0). The ensemble hyperparameters were determined using\\nempirical Bayes, with initial length scale values set to the vector of ones. Subsequently, the resulting ensemble was trained online as\\na DOEBE and as an E-DOEBE, with ˘03b4 = 10-2. Note that in this carefully controlled setting, each basis expansion is entirely\\ndeterministic given the hyperparameters, so the results are purely deterministic and cannot be attributed to poor random seeds.\\nThe resulting weights demonstrate that premature collapse of BMA weights can be a problem. Numerically, the log-likelihood of the\\nE-DOEBE model is dramatically better than that of the DOEBE model (Table 2), showing this collapse can be catastrophic.\\nThis issue can be partially averted by eliminating the threshold of 10 -16 when ensembling. Indeed, in this example, the weights\\nreach a minimum of approximately 10-72. However, with any finite precision arithmetic, there is always the potential for this type\\nof collapse to occur due to numerical underflow. It is trivial to construct such examples by generating the first N1 samples with\\n˘03c3(m)rw = 0 until weight collapse occurs, and the rest of the dataset with ˘03c3(m)rw > 0.\\nKey Takeaway The key takeaway of this experiment is that an ensemble of dynamic and static models can catastrophically collapse\\n˘2014 even when the discrepancy in performance along the entire dataset is large ˘2014 and that the E-DOEBE approach proposed in\\nSection 4.2 can avoid this collapse.\\n4.3 E-DOEBE Outperforms Other Methods\\nThe ultimate goal of the E-DOEBE model is to combine static and dynamic models of several different types. To do so, we repeat\\nthe experiments of Section 5.1 while comparing to an E-DOEBE model. We restrict our attention to static and dynamic versions of\\nthe three best-performing families of models in Experiment 1 ((D)OE-HSGP, (D)OE-RFF, and (D)OE-RBF), and an E-DOEBE\\nensemble containing all of them. The E-DOEBE model is created with ˘03b4 = 10-2, which was not tuned.\\nAs desired, the E-DOEBE model can effectively ensemble dynamic and static models of different basis expansions. Across all\\nexperiments, the E-DOEBE model performs the best in terms of PLL, and is the best in terms of NMSE for all but one dataset\\n(Friedman 2).\\nKey Takeaway The E-DOEBE can effectively ensemble several different ensembles of high-performing basis expansions, resulting\\nin consistently better performance than any single method.\\n5 Conclusion\\nIn this paper, we demonstrated that recent advancements in online prediction using RFF GPs can be extended to arbitrary linear basis\\nexpansions. This included several basis expansions that surpass RFF GPs on real and synthetic datasets. We show how different\\nlinear basis expansions can be combined within a simple framework, enhancing ensemble diversity. While several common choices\\nof basis expansions were employed, it would be worthwhile to expand the tests even further, particularly with splines.\\nWe also demonstrated that the premature collapse of BMA weights can be a concern in online combining. We introduced the\\nE-DOEBE model, which mitigates this issue, and demonstrated its effectiveness. However, this meta-combining may be perceived\\n3as adding a complex workaround to BMA rather than addressing the underlying problems. Further research could explore the\\nincorporation of other Bayesian combining methods, such as Bayesian (hierarchical) stacking.\\nWhile we provide guidance on initializing ensembles given a set of basis expansions, determining which basis expansions to use is\\nan important open topic. A naive approach would be to expand on the existing use of the marginal likelihood for model selection,\\nbut this may be \"unsafe\" when using different basis expansions and therefore requires caution. We additionally presented several\\nideas for inference with non-Gaussian likelihoods, for example, for classification tasks. Determining which, if any, of these tasks is\\nsuperior to the Laplace approximation is another interesting topic for future study.\\nFinally, it could be beneficial to modify or add new basis expansions in the online setting. Indeed, recent progress in GPs has worked\\ntowards selecting and adapting kernels online to great benefit. If such techniques could be adapted to DOEBE, it could eliminate the\\npre-training period and allow for adapting the domain of approximations when new data arrives.\\n6 Tables\\nTable 1: Dataset statistics, including the number of samples, the number of features, and the original source.
